# An analysis of the Reddit "Relationships" subreddit

I use exploratory data analysis and machine learning to understand what Redditors talk about when they talk about love! 


List of files in repo:
* ```reddit_scraper.py`` scrapes top ```N``` reddit posts of subreddit ```S```
  * It returns the following information for each post in a dataframe:
	 * author 
	 * flair 
	 * post_id 
	 * score 
	 * self_txt 
	 * timestamp 
	 * title 
	 * upvote_ratio
 * ```relationships_data.csv```
 	*  888 top posts from r/relationships
 * ```reddit_analysis.ipynb```
 	* A python notebook containing analysis of the data
	


Read my blog for a write-up and look at the ipynb notebook for analysis!
