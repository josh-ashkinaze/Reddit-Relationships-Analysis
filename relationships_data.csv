TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fianc? are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule ? And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I?ve never gotten any of that before and now I?m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha.

Summary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.


Let me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore.

I'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished ""the list"" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you.

A special shout to a few people:
u/mistyranch for courage and sharing 
u/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!)
u/tacofugitive for looking out for me
u/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn
u/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions
u/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping
u/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me
u/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue
u/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year
u/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of
u/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days
u/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure
u/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments
u/daivyjones for the immense support
u/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel
and so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.

Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):
1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.
2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my ""next spouse"" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. 
3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.
4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!
5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.
6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.
7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex
8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. 
9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out. 
10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary
11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.
12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.
13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message 
14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.
15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.
16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his
17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with
   
I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget. 

I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.

In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.

Thank you all once again. 

**tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support

Edit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

3,LadyGrey90,Non-Romantic,beku6e,10712,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?""

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call. 

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This ""relationship"" was my first ""serious"" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely. 

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had. 

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, ""deluding herself into thinking she's actually home"", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn?t happy, I hadn?t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. 

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. 

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven?t felt in years, it?s like I?ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. 

So, if you?re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don?t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt ""forced"" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief. 

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. 

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. 

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. 

 Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.



For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.



Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.



While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. 





I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.




As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding. 

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates. 

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't. 

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything. 

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, ""Are you going to marry me or not?"" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October. 

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn?t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, ""Well did you want to? My lease is up in July."" and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

**Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)",1555441935.0,[Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.,0.98
17,throwaway546566,? Locked Post ?,3g5394,7447,"[My first post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ecgbv/i_30_f_am_sitting_in_the_back_of_my_rv_as_my/) The TLDR of the first post is that I bought an RV with my money so I could write/travel in it while husband is away for business. Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn't want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life.

I promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be.

When I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver's seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me.

Tim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I'm not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: ""I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!"" 

I was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother's house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence.

We made it to his mom's house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, ""I'm not sure myself. I'm waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex.""

Tim's mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim's mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.

Tim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn't apologize at his mother's house, why he didn't say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn't care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven't heard anything since. 

I have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process.

I've been sober since May 22, 2017 :)

It's been almost a year and a half since I posted, I was a mess that day and really overwhelmed. You all gave me the push I needed to gather my courage and tell my husband about my drug use, **thank you so much for that**. I mean it, I knew he needed to know but I couldn't make myself follow through until I received encouragement a bunch of internet strangers. I hate to think what might have happened had I continued hiding it from him.

My husband has been supportive, compassionate, and kind throughout my recovery. I wouldn't be doing so well today without him, there aren't words to express how much I love him and how grateful I am to be married to such a good man. With the help of my therapist I was able to open up to him about being raped (it was a violent, ugly, all around horrible incident) and the effect PTSD has had on me (it's an explanation, not an excuse, for the drug use). 

We've had to work on rebuilding trust and I realize that's going to take time. He still prefers I stay home most of the time and he has reservations about new friends- both are totally reasonable in my opinion. I understand his feelings completely. We do more together now and I feel more included in his life, which has really helped my mental health. Every day I do my best to prove my love, appreciation, and respect for him. We're both continually putting effort into ourselves and our marriage.

As for my recovery, I honestly feel a little weird calling it that. I didn't use long term and didn't face many of the same challenges as other addicts. But I am an addict, I'm always aware of that and I realize I'm no different fundamentally from someone doing heroin on the streets.

Drugs were a distraction and a way to escape bad memories and nightmares. They were also part of my social life as my only friend in the area (at that time) used them too. Once I accepted that I had, and will always have, PTSD and began getting proper treatment I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I'm extremely lucky and thankful I stopped when I did.

Dealing with my mental health hasn't been easy. Last August I went to a behavioral health hospital for six days. I didn't want to go at first but my husband and therapist convinced me I needed to- they were right. I felt much better afterward and I met a few people like me while I was there, it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. People can say that you aren't alone all the time but it's different when you actually experience it.

My husband and I went to couples' therapy for 3 months. It helped us quite a bit, we realized we needed to talk about things that hadn't occurred to either of us before sitting down with a therapist. It helped me understand his feelings and how my drug use (and concealing it from him) affected him. It helped him understand why I did what I did. It gave us a safe place to talk and that eventually led to better communication in private.

I'm still seeing a therapist twice a month and attend group therapy once a month. I'm stable, healthy, and happy. I love my life and I'm really excited about the future. We're expecting a baby in the Spring and I can't wait to be a mom. I'm so looking forward to raising a family with my husband. Life is good. :) Thanks again, /r/relationships 

**TL;DR**: I've been sober since May 22, 2017. My husband and I are doing well, we're happy and very much in love. He's supported me and loved me through this process. We've had a few struggles along the way but we work through things as they come up and move forward. I'm continuing to receive treatment for my mental health and I feel stronger than I ever have. I've learned I can't hide from my problems and now that I've received the appropriate treatment for PTSD I don't want to hide from it anymore.

Did not expect to update this fast.  Did not expect to update at all, unless something miraculous happened.  And it did.

In short, I have the best friends in the world.

I read through a ton of these comments, but not all (over 1000?!)  and decided to look for my fiance's box of wedding planning stuff, because I had a suspicion.  Inside the box was all these magazine clippings of a big church wedding, flower ideas and stuff.  And then I saw pictures of the dresses.  They were all big, poofy ornate things that don't seem akin to my fiancee's style at all.  But...they're similar to the dresses my sisters wore at their weddings.

It all sort of clicked for me.  My fiancee probably doesn't want a church wedding or any of these fancy trimmings, she's trying to win my family's favor.  The hell.  I really should've noticed this earlier and gotten more involved, I know.

My fiancee flew home on Thursday to spend a few days with her dad (Father's Day weekend and all).  I couldn't go because of work, so I was alone until this morning.  So, real late at night, I called up my buddy Ravi (26M).  Ravi's my best man, we've known each other since we were kids, split up when we went off to college, and reconnected three years ago.  We moved to SC so I could join the company he works for. 

I just opened up to Ravi.  It was really late but he listened to me anyway, about my worries about my fiancee.  He said that it was very likely that she was trying to curry favor with my family, but she probably wasn't going to admit to it easily.  He said he'd talk to her.

I told him that he barely knows her.  He said not to worry, and that he'd be around tomorrow evening.

My fiancee came home happy (she always is after seeing her dad) this morning.  I went off to work without asking about the wedding, and she set to work on her writing (she's off for the summer).  I got home early and at like 5 PM Ravi came to my house with my other good friends: Carson, Andrew, and Tim (23-30M).  I know all these guys from various places and we're all a solid group.  Still, this was unexpected.

Ravi came up to my fiancee and said that the guys were taking her wedding dress shopping.

We were both freaked out as hell.  I had no idea this was coming, and my fiancee looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  She whispered to me ""they won't like me"", and I urged her to just go for it.  Ravi reminded her that he has sisters, Carson's been divorced, and Andrew's had his fair share of girlfriends, so they know dresses.  Plus, he has a lady friend that works at a small boutique, where they'd try first.

She still didn't want to go, and then he said something like ""hey, you're marrying our best friend, don't you think we should get to know you and make sure you're not a ghost or something?""  (He's not great with tact).  But she chuckled a little at that and gave in.

They were gone for a while and came back an hour ago.  They didn't find a dress, but they looked around the stores for a while and fiancee found a style she liked (not the poofy ball gown style).  They also went out for ice cream and when they walked in the door, she was joking and laughing with them all.  I hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.  It was amazing.

Then we all sat down together and Ravi asked her to talk to me about what's on her mind.

I still don't know how they got her to open up.  She whispered that she didn't really want the big church wedding, that she wanted to wait a little while and plan a small ceremony for just the people we really care about.  I was all for it, I told her not to worry about bridesmaids or anything, it could just be us.  She said no, she wants her dad, the guys, and my family to be there.  

Andrew, a kickass guitar player, said he'd put together a band for us.  He asked my fiancee what her favorite song is, he'd figure out an arrangement.  This is the kind of question she usually dodges, but she blushed a little and actually told the truth.  (Panama by Van Halen if anyone cares; girl knows how to rock out).  This was the real sign that she's starting to trust them.  I don't think anyone knows her favorite song except me and her dad (who bought her Van Halen CD's growing up)

I told her I'd call my family and tell them the church wedding's off.  If they make a big stink about it, I don't fucking care.  I have my bros and my beautiful future bride.  That's all the family I need.

It?s been about 4 months since my first post and I thought I?d post an update.

Looking back on this post, I can?t believe what a difference 4 months has made. After posting it, I read my own words and realized that the relationship was over. I was making excuses for him and justifying staying miserable in the relationship because I just loved him so much. 

We had a talk when I visited my hometown and broke up. We both were emotional but knew it was  for the best, and I was content thinking we were going to spend time being single and discovering who we are as individuals after being so close for so long. 

Unfortunately, that wasn?t the case. I found out he had been cheating for at least a couple months before telling me he wanted another break. He began officially dating the new girl about 3 days after we broke up and he moved in with her after a couple months of dating. He has always been super resistant to commitments before, so that came as a shock. My self esteem took a huge hit. 

Now things are different. I discover new things about myself every day, I spend time with my friends who make me feel loved and important, and I?m truly happy for the first time in a long time. At first I wanted to start dating again and I told myself I was ready, but the truth is that there?s so much I don?t know about myself yet, and I want to get to know me before I focus on another relationship. 

Anyway, thank you to the people who commented and let me know that something was going on. As obvious as it was to them, I was completely blindsided. I?m just grateful to be out of that situation and I?m excited for what?s ahead.

21,dumbthrowaway843,Updates,9yhlte,6779,"Hi everyone, so a few days ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xoy6k/this_girl_early_20sf_in_is_tearing_our_dnd_group/?sort=confidence) about this girl (Sam) in my DND group who everyone has a crush on, and how it's causing a lot of my friends to turn on me cuz they think she has a crush on me.

&#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

So I wanted to thank everyone for all the great advice I got, and it led me to take some action over the weekend. So on Sunday (yesterday), I was txting with Sam and I decided to bring up and ask her how she was feeling about our gaming group. She confessed to me that she's been feeling really stressed out lately because she feels that Jake and Dave (our DM) have really been ostracizing her, because she's been getting closer to me. She told me that Dave would send her private angry or rude messages, saying mean things about me to her behind my back. I was shocked and honestly kind of defeated to hear how these guys who I thought were my friends treated me behind my back. She said she was so cut up about this and that she didn't want to come to DND anymore because she didn't feel like it's any fun anymore, and that hurt me the most, having her lose something she loves because of some dumb guys.

&#x200B;

So, based on the advice I got here on my last post, I did two things after getting this knowledge. I called up Dave, and told him that he either needs to grow up, and treat her with the respect she deserves, or she will leave the group. He was backpedaling, but eventually came clean that he has a thing for her as well and was just jealous of the attention I was receiving from her. He said that it's not her fault and it's not my fault and it's just something he needs to work through on his own, so at least he was able to be cognizant of that. The second thing I did was talk to Sam frankly about us and our relationship. I told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she liked me as well, which she said she really did, and had for a while now (which made my heart want to explode out of my chest). I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, even with all this drama going on, and I told her that I was on her side and would support her whatever she wanted to do with our gaming group. In the end, we've decided that we are dating now and we'll both be taking a break from DND for a few sessions before we go back and tell everyone. I am just so happy to have her in my life, and if my friends can't get over the fact that we're dating, she and I will start a new DND group with people who can be adults about it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, thank you all for your help, and I'm glad I bit the bullet, I couldn't be happier right now!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I asked the girl out, she said yes we're dating now :) I called out our DM on his BS and he apologized and said he would cut it out. Looking forward to brighter DND days with my girlfriend!**

&#x200B;

**EDIT: 1.2K?? I never expected this to blow up so much! Thank you again, everyone, for your kind words, thoughts, anecdotes, and advice. I've talked to Dave again today actually and told him that Sam and I were officially together and we want to be able to come back and play all together again, but my respect for Sam's feelings overcomes my want to continue playing with them. Dave told me that he was really sorry for being such an ass before and that he is happy for Sam and I and doesn't want this to come between our friendship. I am hopeful that we can move past this! Also -- to those who suggested Sam invite a female friend to our group, she reached out to one of her best friends from high school who still lives in the area, and she is interested in joining! I think Sam will feel more comfortable, and it'll take some of the spotlight off our new relationship if we invite a new player into our group. Anyway, wanted to update and thank everyone again for all your kind comments.** ",1542640455.0,UPDATE: girl (20s F) in my DND group post (20s M),0.98

I thought I would update on what?s happened since my post one year ago.

&#x200B;

Shortly after, I chose an appropriate time to talk to R about the situation. I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It?s when leaving the house and I?m not late for any commitments.

&#x200B;

I also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it.

&#x200B;

In the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months.

&#x200B;

In September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship.

&#x200B;

Around this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn?t to be just mine but mine and R?s.

&#x200B;

That evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn?t feel like he needed to live alone to ?discover himself?. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc.

&#x200B;

**( edit:** this note now hangs in our bedroom wall as a sign of how we dreamed this house, planned it and accomplished it together. )

&#x200B;

By this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent. We went to see it and R loved it as much as me.

&#x200B;

Over the last 5 months he has surprised me everyday. He has taken this flat and looked after it in a responsible adult way. R has been busy fixing everything that needed TLC in the house, spent time decorating the bedroom, he even started to cook and now makes delicious meals. His parents visit often and are super proud of him too.

&#x200B;

**We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.**

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your advice.

Hey everyone, I wrote this post just over 2 month ago, and i got a lot of advice and help and thought I should do an update.

I took a lot of your advice. I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn?t go on with such little help anymore. 

We wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don?t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn?t realise How ?unequal? the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he?d change.

We take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it?s working very well.

Now we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he?s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He?ll read stories and is being much more involved.

I still do a lot which I?m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that?s what I?m happiest with doing. I?m just appreciative of the help he?s now giving me. I don?t feel alone anymore. 

I think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he?s feeling overwhelmed, I?ll do more and vice versa.

I do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now. 

We also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind. 

I do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I?m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I?m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a ?secondary ? parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple. 

I might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer.
I know this isn?t the most amazing update and it?s just a case of communicating better but you?ve all helped so much and I?m very appreciative. I love reddit!

Thanks for all your comments/advice.

I want to thank every single person who gave me advice. All of it was really helpful, and it calmed me down, and gave me a plan. 

I went up to my dad on monday, and said this to him ""Dad, I love you and I'm worried about how you've been behaving recently. You're a good father and I'm scared that you're going to do something rash and you won't be around anymore. Please talk to me and tell me what's going on."" (Credit to /u/abitnotgood). My dad just had a deer in the headlights look. I then told him ""Dad, you've been acting different lately with buying a gun, and crying, and all the other things. What's going on? I know you are having a lot of feelings because the guy who killed mom is getting out soon. So am I, we can work on this together."" My dad broke down, and so did I. We talked about how hard it was for him when Mom first died, how he was sorry for being so distant in the first few years, how he felt like a terrible father and husband. I asked him the question if he intended to kill the other guy, or commit suicide. He cried even harder, and said he was confused, and didn't know if killing that guy would avenge mom's death. I told him that Mom wouldn't want him to go to jail for the rest of his life, and neither do I. That guy wasn't worth it, and I didn't want him to take both my parents away from me. I bought up counseling, and he agreed to go. I got one separate for him and me, because I didn't feel it was right to intrude upon his closure. I mean he did know my mom as a different person, and had different experiences. We are going to a therapist this saturday, one in the city, and my dad promised to sell the shotgun. I want to thank everyone here from the bottom of my heart for helping me, and my dad though this. Thank you.

My fianc?, ""Dale"", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.

Dale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.

I used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line ""Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...""

The subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. ""Jen"" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.

Rest of the subject line was ""Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?""

The email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.

Even worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like ""she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it."" And then she answered with a bunch of ""lol""s and said she felt sorry for the ""poor girl"". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. 

That is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of ""if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.""

But to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.

The emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.

Obviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses ""backdoor"". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.

I'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.

I'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now.

I posted a few days ago because I found my fiance on an online dating site. I took reddit's advice and catfished him...

A few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted.

When he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up.

Long story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account.

He obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me.

I fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure.

I apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago.

He offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another ""trust but verify"" type of situation.

Tl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile.

Hey everyone. First off, thank you for caring so much about my situation. You all have great advice, encouragement, and you helped me hold on to the strength I need to make it through this. I still have a lot to get through and I'm hurting so much right now. It comes in waves; sometimes I feel so empowered and strong, then 10 minutes later I'm crying in a ball and feel like I can't move or do anything.

Last night I texted Dale and told him that my best friend, ""Jake"", had gotten into a fight with his boyfriend and I was going to go stay with him so he could vent and have somebody with him.

I told Jake what happened and showed him the emails (I took pictures of them on my phone in case I needed them for whatever reason). Jake and his boyfriend ""Mike"" (who he had obviously not gotten into a fight with and was there) were infuriated and we all just sort of cried together for a while.

They stayed up with me almost all night helping me figure out my next moves. We all agreed that taking the high road was the best route. We made a list of all the things that were necessary to get out of the apartment. Mike is a property manager for a different apartment complex so this morning he called my property manager and gave her a very condensed, detail-free version of what was happening. I have always thought it important to get to know your property manager in case you ever have a situation where they can help you out, so she always really liked me. Dale and I have been paying rent on a month to month basis for about 3 months because we were starting to look for houses to purchase after we settled down after the wedding. My property manager told Mike that working out getting my name off of the rental agreement wouldn't be a problem and to not worry about the 30 day notice that she typically requires for a tenant moving out.

As far as finances go, I make about 70% of our combined income and Dale only covers about 30%. When Jake, Mike, and I were discussing the logistics of me moving out, Mike brought up the point that Dale does not make enough to cover the required 3x rent in income each month. Meaning he will most likely be given notice to move out if he cannot find a roommate fast. We lived in a one bedroom so I doubt he'll be able to find someone quickly who is willing to sleep on a couch versus having their own bedroom. Especially since I purchased the couch, so... there isn't even one there anymore. The thought of this brings me great pleasure, as I'm sure you can imagine.

Jake and I each called out of work today and we rented one of those mover pick up trucks. We were pretty organized after making our list and it only took us a couple of trips to get my stuff out and into Jake and Mike's garage for the time being.

Dale texted me a couple of times asking how Jake is and if I'm coming home after work tonight. I told him I'm already home (not exactly a lie, I was there at the time) and then I said Jake was going to be okay and that I just couldn't believe how awful people can be to the people they love. Dale agreed and said that he was glad he had such a ""good girl"" like me. It was tempting to say something about how yeah, I'm just so vanilla that way. I didn't, I just told him to always remember that, how great I am to him. He said of course he would. That felt pretty satisfying and I hope he does remember that everyday for the rest of his life.

Whoever it was that posted about the vanilla ice cream idea, Jake, Mike, and I laughed about that hysterically last night. It was the first thing that made me laugh like that and may be the only thing for a while, so thank you for that.

I didn't end up ruining any of Dale's stuff, I didn't print out the emails and send them to his family/friends, I didn't do anything destructive or spiteful. However, after all my stuff was out, Jake and I made a trip to the grocery store. I took that poster's advice and I bought one of those big plastic tubs of vanilla ice cream. I left it on the counter with a note and my engagement ring. I wrote ""I know vanilla isn't your favorite flavor, but this is the only vanilla you'll be eating from now on. XOXO"". I mean... I am human. I had to leave him with a little bit of a bang.

So here I am. Staying with Mike and Jake for a while. Finding an apartment will be no issue for me, I am comfortable financially on my own with a stable job. I have to deal with the deposits I put down for the venues for both the wedding and the reception. I can't right now, I'm too much of a mess emotionally. I will by the week's end though as I know I can't put it off any longer if there's any hope at all of getting refunded. I had already booked our honeymoon but I did pay the extra for insurance if the trip needed to be cancelled. I honestly don't really know what exactly the insurance covers, I'll have to look into it. Wether or not I can get a refund for Dale's ticket, I will be going on my first trip out of the country on my own and I am happy about this. It's one bright thing to look forward to through this whole mess.

I will sell my wedding dress- which was a low cut dress by the way and showed my scar off as much as a wedding dress can. I guess Dale would have found that gross. Or maybe I'll burn it. Burning it sounds kind of fun because I've been holding back so much on not being destructive in a time where I would have found great (albeit temporary) pleasure in burning everything Dale has ever owned. Burning my dress is something I can do privately that will still be satisfying. I can scream and cry and throw rocks at it, pour lighter fluid all over it, watch it burn, and then cook a s'more over it. Because I love s'mores so why not?

I am walking away from Dale with my head held high. The best revenge is to walk away as dignified as possible and to not sink to his level. I was close with his family but I'm not going to worry about what he tells them. I am positive it won't be the truth- there is no way he's got the balls and decency to tell them what he did. But *I* know what he did, *he* knows what he did, and all the people who truly love me and who I am close with will know what he did. That's all that really matters. Though it's nice to have those emails just in case Dale tries to take things too far or something. I'm going to be okay. I'm having one of my empowered moments. Though I just spent the last hour in the bathtub sobbing. Like I said, waves. Jake told me that Dale isn't worthy of my ""quirky"" nipple and I agree.

When I got in my accident, I was lucky that the shrapnel didn't pierce my heart. I did however suffer from a pretty significant heart contusion (basically a bruised heart) among other injuries. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. So yeah, this situation makes my heart hurt, but my heart has been through much worse and kept on ticking along. 

Sorry if I rambled a lot, posting this to you all is like a form of therapy and the more thoughts that pop up in my mind, I just write them down for you all to read. I haven't told my family and other friends yet, I'll be tackling that soon. I'm glad the invites hadn't already been sent, at least I don't have to send out a cancellation notice. I deleted Dale off all social media and blocked his email address. I didn't block him off my phone yet because, honestly, I'm curious to his reaction. I can promise you all that I will not respond AT ALL. Not to a single text or call. But I can't help but be interested to see how he reacts. I will block him tomorrow though. Mike told me that the second his messages turn ugly or hateful because I'm not responding, block him. He doesn't want Dale to hurt me anymore than he already has. He's right and I really do plan to block him regardless by tomorrow after seeing his initial reaction.

I guess that's all I have to update. Thank you all for caring about me. I will continue moving forward and I will never stop wearing clothes that show my scar. I've never hidden it before and I'm not going to let some asshole make me feel like I should. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for your love. You gave amazing comments and messages. I will never forget the nice things you all have said to me. Seriously, thank you!

PS: I think I will dress up as Edward Scissorhands for Halloween.

**tl;dr** got my stuff out of the apartment, left fianc? with basically no explanation. Besides a tub of vanilla ice cream and a little note. I'm feeling okay at this moment but it's been up and down all day and will continue to for a long time.

**Edit:** So last night got pretty crazy. It started with Dale playing dumb and asking what was going on and what did he do? Like I promised all of you, I didn't respond. The dick knew exactly what he'd done. He just kept texting and kept texting. One text that I found particularly infuriating was ""I can't think of anything I have done to deserve this. Whatever you think I've done isn't true I'm sure you just misunderstood and I can explain. I mean damn you didn't have to be so dramatic and just leave me like this"".

I love how he was already saying that I just misunderstood what I ""think"" he's done and that he can explain. He's such a shit person that he wouldn't  even just come out and admit to the emails and say he's sorry. And then to call me dramatic.

The texts progressed into angry ones. Here is a string of texts from him, word for word (except that I corrected some grammar because his grammar is ridiculous). Each text was probably sent about 2 minutes apart, sometimes less. Just so you understand the level of crazy here. I will refer to myself as ""Elle"" in these because he uses my name a lot and my real name starts with an ""L"" so seems appropriate. I blocked him after this, by the way.

""Baby you know how much I love you, I'm at a loss right now. I don't understand, why won't you answer me??""

""I just tried calling. ELLE PLEASE PICK UP!""

""We are getting married, I thought you cared about me. I guess I was wrong.""

""I guess you are cold hearted.""

""Elle??????""

""Baby??""

""Are you ok? At least answer me so I know you are ok and not hurt or something.""

""Seriously?????""

""ELLE!!!!""

""Seriously you're a bitch.""

""I didn't mean that, I'm just getting really worried and upset.""

He took about a 20 minute break between that one and this monstrosity:

""You know what, I did mean that. You're a f**king bitch for doing this. If you were unhappy you should have told me. I can't believe you would do this to me, I love you. You are just like your father but even worse because at least your mom is a c--t and so are you so who can blame him. Don't ever contact me again or come crawling back and good luck finding a guy who will love a f**king circus freak bitch. Lol lol lol, dumbass"".

So that's when I blocked him. I know nothing he said was true but still... this wasn't just an email to his ex, this was something he sent to me *directly*. I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard. This is someone I was planning a future with just a couple of days ago. He was so sweet, as far as I knew obviously. He used to kiss my hand almost every morning. It's just such a shock it's hard to wrap my mind around it.

Last night was a really tough night to get through for me.

I keep reading back what I wrote in this update last night and it helps to keep me feeling strong. I keep reading all of your lovely comments and messages from the original post and it helps to keep me feeling loved and strong. Jake and Mike are wonderful and I'm lucky to have them to hold my hand and help me through this. 

Though his texts hurt me, they also reaffirmed that he's a spineless weasel and that I 10000% did the right think by leaving. He's making it really easy to get over him.

Sorry this got so long, I wanted to really include you all in what's happening. Thanks for checking in on me and caring about what happens to me, love to you all!

**Little update:** Wow! You are all amazing, wonderful people. So much love and support, I'm crying because of all your lovely, sweet messages. It's honestly so encouraging!

I had the intention of responding to some comments but the post is now locked, so I just wanted to make sure to update this to say thank you! I hope you all see this.

I had a lot of people pm me asking if there were any signs that Dale was an asshole so they know what kind of red flags to look out for. Honestly... no. I wish I could say yes to that so I could potentially prevent others from going through what I did or something similar. He was very attentive and loving, he never once made fun of my appearance (to my face), he seemed to appreciate my ambition and independence. I never felt controlled or criticized for being a financially stable, educated woman.

I had a therapist after I lost my friend in the accident. My father had also walked out earlier that year so we were discussing this and how I hadn't seen it coming. My therapist told me that people can make you see whatever they want you to see but that they can't keep up the facade forever. Things almost always come to a head eventually. The only thing you can do is be secure enough with yourself to understand that the faults of others has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you surround yourself with enough good people that you can afford to lose one or two along the way. 

I suppose that would be my advice on the matter. Love people openly and let yourself be loved but always keep hold of yourself and make sure you have yourself covered should someone let you down along the way.

As far as the dress goes, I believe I will take the advice of many of you and donate it to flood victims in Louisiana. It is a beautiful gown. I think what I will burn instead is my reception dress. I've got to burn something. ;)

Thanks Reddit, I sincerely love all of you and wish you the best in all of your life endeavors! I might pop back up in a few weeks to update you all on how I'm doing.

It's been eight months, and I thought I'd give an update.


First of all, we're still together. The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of ""this is a major problem and will not go away"" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.


There are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:



* He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it

* Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together. 


These two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:


Over the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.


He figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.


He came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.


Thanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now.

So I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life?s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me.

After posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over.

? Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily?s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a ?home wrecker?. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I?d been cheating on Sam and how I?d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he?d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend?s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn?t in the flat? I was celebrating Sam?s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven?t had any other messages from him since.

Emily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can?t say I saw anything, but I also can?t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I?ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be ?free? from our partners but she knew I wouldn?t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own ?abusive? relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off.

I didn?t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we?re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I?m breaking my lease, and I?m going to spend the night in a friend?s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I?ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision.

Also a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn?t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to ?I know he?s not cheated on me with Emily?, but I do know he didn?t.

First off, thank you all so much for your advice and words of support. I?m sorry that I couldn?t reply to every comment, reply, or PM that I got, but I woke up to a locked post and over 100 unread messages. I promise, I did read through every one of them. Each perspective was incredibly helpful and made me look at the situation in a completely different way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 

I spoke to Max this morning. I told him that as terrible as I feel for Caroline, I don?t want him living over there until February. I suggested that we brainstorm some sort of schedule that allowed him to continue visiting her, even postponing our honeymoon and using that money to fund his plane tickets. Several commenters brought up her moving over here for treatment, so I mentioned that as well, offering up our spare bedroom. I emphasised that I didn?t fault him for wanting to help an old loved one in what could be her final days, but that I couldn?t help but feel marginalised, especially so close to our wedding. 

Max didn?t speak very much, just listened while I rambled on. When I couldn?t think of anything else to add, I asked him to please say something. 

So he told me the truth: Caroline was never stage 4. She was stage 2. 

He assured me that the rest of his story is true. Caroline asking him to be with her, the initial surgery being unsuccessful, her chemo treatment plan, etc. But apparently her chances of survival are *far* greater than he led me to believe. 

Max said he lied because he felt it was the only way I could understand his need to be with her. He thought that if her situation seemed less dire than literal life-or-death, I wouldn?t agree to him essentially moving across the country for her. 

He admitted to telling her that our wedding had been postponed to next August, giving her the impression that him being away until February would be no problem. He has also been the one insisting on remaining by her side. After her surgery, she had given him permission to return home, saying that it wouldn?t be fair to pressure him into living with her throughout her entire chemo treatment, as much as she would have liked him there. He refused to leave. He told her that I supported this decision fully. 

Max swears that he?s not in love with her still, but I just can?t believe that. He lied to my face. Before she visited our apartment back in May, he warned me not to mention her being stage 4 as she was still ?extremely sensitive about it.?  And I completely bought into that lie. I trusted him. 

He put his past with her over his future with me. I?ll be spending the next few months apartment hunting and cancelling wedding plans. 

Thank you all for your kind words.

31,AggressiveImpact7,Relationships,abayxw,5884,"tl;dr My husband and I got into an argument and he left for almost 2 days.

Husband is 36m, I'm 29 f. We've been together for over a decade. We have a 7 month old daughter.

In the past, we have normally resolved arguments by taking a few hours to cool off and discussing. However, this situation is different and I don't know what to do.

We flew back from his parent's house the day before yesterday. While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said ""do NOT say those things in front of MY child."" It was loud enough that people were staring and I was really embarrassed.

Then we got home and I put the baby to bed and then he tried to initiate sex with me. I told him I wasn't in the mood after what happened at the airport, and he lost it and said I shouldn't put sex in his head by calling him sexy and then not have sex with him. I told him I would've be up for sex had he not snapped at me! He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. I tried calling him and just got a text back that said he wants space to cool off so he ""doesn't do something he'll regret."" I told him to come home NOW as I've been alone with the baby for 2 days and it's New Years but he won't.

Should I give him space or give him an ultimatum?

Although my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ddj8r/how_can_i_19f_talk_to_him_20f_about_our_sex_life/) didn't get much attention, it's been about a year and a half and I thought I'd give an update. 

We broke up. In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me.

So what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.

Now, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time.

Oh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;)

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0l1n/update_i_22m_suspect_something_between_my/)

You wonderful motherfuckers. Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to /r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha. 

I got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of **Alexis.** Not women in general.

I got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish. 

A clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a ""hey, guess who dropped by"" situation.

Anyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there.

In the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there ""not even Brooke."" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes. 

I got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with ""Dude, what the fuck."" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious.  In his words: ""I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some."" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever.  Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything.  Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom ""Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then."" Imagining that moment was kind of funny.  Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously.  During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.  

When we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in.  I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate.  He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over. 

This week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute.  As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying ""Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution.""  I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it. 

Later that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to.  She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day.  She said she felt guilty that she ""led him on"" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???)  She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (""not rape, but..idk I never said yes either"") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on.  She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to ""make it right"" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by:

* Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again

* Give me full access to her phone and passwords.  She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times.

* Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?) 

* Makeup sex whenever I wanted

Yeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer.  I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from ""our song"") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying ""She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL"" 

In happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said ""First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it."" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful. 

As for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it. 

So that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with.  Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them. 

Again, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support. 

I fucking love you guys.

34,Enort,? Locked Post ?,2o0l1n,5813,"A lot of you requested an update to my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/).

The majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act.  I decided on doing both.

Sunday night everyone was back in the apartment.  I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused.

The next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore.  In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't. 

When I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back.  I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking.  Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there.

She was fucking Mark.  I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us (**not** the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said ""Nice. Real fucking nice."" and bolted back to my car.

I heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was *How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them?* My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch. 

I'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop.  She started off asking me to come home so she could explain.  Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was *good, you earned it*. There was a pause and then she sent ""I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out."" I waited. She sent ""Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me."" No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something.

I received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure.  He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year. 

I don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture.  I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend *and* friends.

Any advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her. 

**EDIT:** I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan.

Original tl;dr: Former FWB who lives in a different country says she's pregnant and keeping the kid. Don't know what to do. Advice please.

At the time, lots of you saw many red flags that I didn't and you were pretty sure she wasn't actually pregnant. You were right, she wasn't! After telling her I'd only continue talking to her when there was a paternity test, she initially agreed. She then made up more stories about hospital visits, problems with the pregnancy and got angry that I wasn't being supportive. I held my ground and told her I wouldn't communicate further until the paternity test was done.

About a week later, she finally admitted it - it had all been a lie to get my attention. I sent her a message asking her to get help and never contact me again. Blocked her everywhere.

That was over a year ago, and I've had occasional messages (from other numbers) since then, either asking for forgiveness or getting angry with me for not offering forgiveness. I generally ignored them, though she did get in my head once by sending a message that she was so worried she'd damaged me and I replied telling her that I'd moved on and forgave her. 

About 2 months ago, she text saying she was visiting the city I live in and wanted to meet up for a chat. I ignored it and blocked the number. Didn't think much of it.

Then, 1 month ago, while I was on holiday, the receptionist at my work sent me a text. Someone had enrolled in a course in the where I teach who was asking about me. 27-year-old Russian. Holy shit, it was her! I had to tell my manager the story and she agreed to me taking some extra holiday and working remotely to avoid any unpleasant situation. 

I received a few texts from her, telling me she had enrolled in that school by coincidence (no chance) and finally one to 'congratulate me on avoiding my idea of hell'. Her course finished last week and I found out from some social media stalking that she's now in another city. I think (hope!) that's the end of the story.

I got some really good advice about how to handle the first Thanksgiving after my husband passed, since I wanted to see his family as well as spend the day with my boyfriend Alan.

So I knew how much it would mean to my late husband?s family for me to at least stop by their dinner, but I also didn?t want my boyfriend to feel awkward or pushed aside. I?m happy to say he was an absolute gem and dinner at my mom?s was great. We played some games and ate a lot, then Alan drove me to my late husband?s family?s dinner and dropped me off.

I said hello to everyone and had a small plate (so much food!) then left after about an hour. My MIL was so happy to see me, and even though it was hard ? she pulled me aside and cried a bit ? I?m glad I went.

While I visited, Alan drove around a local park and played Pok?mon Go, haha. So he was happy when he came back to get me and he had hatched a few eggs in the meantime. The next day we got our Christmas tree.

Communication with all parties wins again! Not a super exciting update but I?m glad I was able to make everyone happy and still have a good holiday myself. I know Christmas is going to be very hard but with the lovely, supportive people I?m lucky enough to know, I?ll be okay.

We share custody of our children, and they transitioned to public school and are doing very, very well. 

I'm doing pretty well, too. It's been hard - and there have been a lot of ups and downs, but it's been worth it. We're all so much happier now, and my ex and I are working really well together to co-parent our kids and we're even friends. We'll always be there for each other, but we're better off apart.

He said that an old teacher of his was on the scholarship board and saw him at the store, and brought it up to him assuming we knew. But we didn't know as the letter hadn't come in the mail yet. But after she said something he knew, and when the letter came he took it.  

He was mad at me at the time (now he doesn't even remember why) and says that he responded to the letter thanking them but  telling them I had received a full ride scholarship to the school of my choice and no longer needed funding.  He gave them his own cell phone number and said they could call him with any questions.  He says they did and he just convinced them I didn't need the scholarship and they should give it to someone else, so they did.

He admits it was shitty of him but doesn't seem to think it was a big deal. He doesn't even see the value of the money lost because I still got to go to college, but the difference was that I ended up 40k in debt with student loans.  I still owe 35k and the interest is counting. The scholarship would have paid out a total of 45k over the course of my college education as long as I maintained minimum grades. 

His prank cost me tens of thousands of dollars. I know he's in AA and the goal is to make amends and fix relationships, but this honestly makes me never want to see him again. I spent college SO incredibly stressed over money and this could have solved so much of it, and he did this over something he can't even remember now.

Where do I go from here? Am I ""supposed to"" let this go?  Sorry this is kind of a rant, I don't really know what I'm asking other than just general advice of how this should affect my relationship with him. I feel like I don't want any relationship with him at all now but I know I might regret that years down the road.

Hi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go...

Anyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put ""next month"" in the title but realistically, I should have put ""next week."" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up.

First and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!!

So I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this:

""Mark,

First off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited. 

I just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :)

I wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all. 

Again, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. ""

(The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar)

Anyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there.

Saturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon.

We decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this.

Anyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now.

Thanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!

When I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.  

My mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here.

I needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is.

I started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine.

I opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M.

It was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed.

My therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly.

Thank you, Reddit.

41,Kvltshroom,Relationships,bqftfh,5556,"Since we met my boyfriend has been on and off of tinder, I?ve been very clear that it hurts me but he always defended it as just him ?wanting an ego boost?. A few months ago we had a major argument about it where I threatened to leave and I honestly thought that was going to be the end of it. Pretty naive, really. Also I should note his ex before me left him for this very reason- I feel like an idiot for thinking he?d ever change.

Today I woke up and realised he?d been using my phone and his email was logged in. I noticed he?d gotten an email from an app called hinge- just to give you an idea of the kind of app this is, the description read: ?the app that was designed to be deleted?. Great. My stomach instantly dropped. I logged into it with his phone number and he?s put up profile pictures of him that I?ve taken when we?ve been on days out together?! In his description he?s got things like ?we?ll get along if you like Chinese and have a dog, if you?re silly and comfortable and over share?. He?s also put in as a strict preference that he wants to be matched with hindus/muslims only. I?m white british.

I knew something was going on yesterday but wasn?t sure what, he was acting differently and it was making me so anxious. He had the nerve to tell me that I must just be hormonal? I think the worst part about it is his reaction to all of this- he heard me crying, acted concerned and then saw me with his phone, at which point he just took it from me and went back to bed. That was about an hour ago and the only interaction I?ve had with him since was him asking me to open the bathroom door... not to see if I was okay, but because he needed to pee. This post sounds like a joke at this point.

I?m obviously hurt by the fact that he?s on this thing but I think I?m more shocked by his total lack of guilt or response to me being upset. I?m so angry and there?s nothing I can do with it- I?m so embarrassed about the situation I don?t want to tell my family/friends how he?s treated me, and I can?t even talk to him about it because he?s refusing to address anything?s wrong, he?s still in bed. I don?t know what to do. He?s brought my self esteem down so much that I feel like I can?t be without him, but I know i can?t stay in this situation. Should I even bother trying to talk to him or should I just leave? I?ve taken screenshots of everything and initially I was going to send them to his family but thought against it. The thing is, if I just leave there?s literally zero consequences for him. He gets what he wants, he gets the freedom to go on random dates with no guilt. It just seems so fucking unfair that I?m the one left heartbroken and he gets to party up.

I know the majority of replies are going to tell me to leave, and I can?t argue with you there. But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge?

TLDR: caught my boyfriend of three years on another dating app, he?s refusing to even acknowledge the fact that I?m upset. Don?t know what to do.

Edit-**UPDATE:** So within the hour after I'd initially written this post I got myself and my stuff together, packed it in my car and left. It felt impossible, there was a lot of stuff and I was a wreck but I managed it in the end. Throughout the whole time, he was just in bed pretending to sleep, which made me angry more than anything. I felt like he couldn't care less. We'd been living together for two years but fortunately, in September I'd decided to get my own student apartment- obviously, I knew then that things weren't going well and thank god I made that decision because now I have a place to stay. Whilst I was sat on the driveway in my car ready to leave I got a text from him saying 'I'm not going to insult you by asking you to stay or to come back but could you please leave the keys to the house'. I had already left them, but that last dig at me made me so mad and hurt. No apology, no goodbye just 'leave the keys'. I guess that's my closure. 

&#x200B;

So currently I'm just sitting in bed with my stuff all around me in bags reading through these comments, and have been for the last couple of hours. Thank you for the support, even the comments that were harsh I greatly appreciate- it just gave me a wake-up call and a kick up the ass to sort my life out. I'm sad that this shitshow of a relationship has come to an end, angry that it happened the way it did- but funnily enough, I'm relieved. I can do what I want now and get on top of my self-esteem issues. I'm driving down to see my mum and the rest of the family tomorrow, I haven't seen them since Christmas and I absolutely cannot wait. The anger's still there, but I'm just going to get on with things. I absolutely cannot waste any more energy on that guy.

I spoke to her the day after. She told me she had wanted to tell me for a while, but didn't know where to start-- that she thought about Sam everyday but at the same time didn't know how to begin.

She pulled out a shoe box from her closet and she showed me the pictures. Pictures of her wedding, this propped up little thing at the courthouse, her in a short white dress with a slight stomach. Her husband, this cocky smiled kid with this shaggy blond hair. 

Then the baby, Sam. Pictures from a red-faced baby to this little four year old person. Birthdays, and Christmases, and pictures of the three of them- a family.

She talked about Brendan. How they came from these radically different backgrounds and she barely knew him as a person before he was a father and husband. They'd only been dating three months when she got pregnant. They were twenty.

Then she talked about Sam- her baby. She kept saying he was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hearing that broke my heart. She talked about how his hair cow licked in three different spots and how he was always singing or humming, that he loved to climb. She told me his favorite movie and book. She made him a person to me. 

Then she told me how they lost him. Some kid ran a red light and then he was gone. She barely remembers the funeral because she was so heavily medicated. But the worst part was after, going home and him not being there- how she'd walk past his room and expect to hear him playing, waking up and forgetting for a minute he was gone. 

Their marriage had never been good and they turned on each other. He blamed her because she had fastened the booster seat on that side of the car. She blamed him because he had been driving. They were divorced within a year after the accident. Brendan had a new child within two.

She had spent the time doing overload on classes and working, keeping busy because it made things easier.She didn't see her old friends because they drifted away- they never knew what to say. And they mostly had kids of their own. She was surviving. But seeing Sam's brother who looked so much like Sam hurt so much that she decided she had to get away and stop wallowing. She took the pictures down, donated clothes and toys, deleted her fb and stopped seeing the old friends who weren't really friends anymore. She said she chose to keep breathing because that was what it had come down to. Then she met me.. and she said I made her want a fresh start- a better marriage and more children- because she loved me.

We talked for hours, she cried and I cried for her. 

 I still love her maybe more now because I feel like she opened up to me so much. it's hard to imagine her married, with a son, toys on the floor, and pictures on the fridge. it's hard because in a lot of ways it's the life I've been imagining with her.

I still plan on marrying this woman. She's the love of my life. 

tl;dr She told me about her past. I love her and understand why she didn't tell me.

I decided I'd have a talk with him, I told him that it was basically really damn inappropriate to find out I have money and start making demands. I told him I have no problems using my finances for our relationship but that he shouldn't automatically expect that I'm going to put out money on very expensive things for him, just because. He seemed very ashamed and agreed that it was a really crappy thing to do and he got carried away and a bit too excited. I told him I understood but to do that was very disrespectful to me and the time we've shared together because it made me feel like all of a sudden my money is what mattered.







For a little while it seemed all was well, then the other day we were having a minor argument over something that turned into a bigger argument and he said something along the lines of well you don't even want to use what you have for us so maybe you've never fucking cared about me. He got really quiet as though he knew that was a shitty thing to say and we didn't talk until 2 days later. I was really angry, I was going to talk things through with him.






However this came the relationship fatality. He told a couple people we're good with, despite me asking him to keep the money quiet, that I was really rich and could afford tons of shit. How did I find out, Saturday we all went drinking together, he gets a bit too much in his system and orders an expensive bottle of wine, one of our friends was like who orders that shit, we're good with our beers and that's too expensive. Our other friend piped up and was like no it's good /u/FamilyHeiress is really rich, she can pick up our tab tonight, cue several other people who I've never told about my family's money suddenly grilling me on why I never trusted them enough to tell them about my money and oh, thought we were friends that kind of thing. 






I broke up with him the next day. He's been blowing up my phone all day but fuck him, I could have moved past what he said the other day when we were arguing but to tell people I specifically asked him not to something I trusted him so much with. Yeah, I've lost a 3 year relationship and am probably going to lose a few friends as well.






tl;dr talked to my bf, he said he'd make an effort, he didn't, told some of our friends that I was wealthy, they were shocked I didn't trust them with this, I dumped him, may lose some friends soon as well

Hey Reddit, 

My OP didn't get much of a response, but I appreciate those who offered support/advice and wanted to give an update in case anyone was wondering. 


Originally, my weekend got a little more busy than I had planned, so I decided to move my coming out day until Tuesday. 

So, on Sunday, I called my mom to set up dinner (if I hadn't, I knew I would back out and not tell them) and my mom was feeling impatient I guess, because she was just like ""let's talk about it now"" and put me on speaker phone with my dad right next to her. 


So, I told them. And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked ""is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!"" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. 

We are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was ""Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname""

So I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. 

I also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. 

I hope you guys all have a great week!

[First Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33aypy/update_i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f/)

Hey everybody. I've been asked multiple times for an update, but it's been super busy, and I actually have a little time today, so I thought I would update everybody on my situation.

My ex made a doctor's appointment for a couple of days after my last post. She sent me a text with the date and time, and asked me if I would be going with her; I told her that I wouldn't but that I wanted Emily to go with her. She straight up refused and said this was ""our baby"" and that if I didn't go, she would cancel the appointment and wait until I was ready to go. We argued for a little bit until I gave in. I told her that I would meet her there, and I would stay for the entire thing, but I was going to be stone silent the whole time unless the doctor asked me a question.

Her appointment was at 9.15 that morning, I showed up at 9.10 and sat across from her in the waiting room. The doctor called her back a couple of minutes later. They talked for a couple of minutes, she asked her some questions, and then she had her go to the restroom to pee in a cup (I made sure that her purse and everything stayed in the room - somebody warned me she would be crazy enough to buy a pregnant woman's pee and use that instead). After she gave the cup to the doctor, the doctor left and then she tried to talk to me. I sat there and ignored her and texted my friends until the doctor came back and confirmed that she was pregnant. I started shaking and tried to control my breathing, but my ex was so excited, and the doctor was excited with her. Then came the ultrasound, and my ex was roughly 11 weeks pregnant. After a couple of minutes, I excused myself and left. I texted her as I was leaving that before anything else happens, we're having a paternity test.

First off, Noninvasive Prenatal Testing is super expensive. I told her that I would pay for half, but that if the child wasn't mine, then she would have to pay me back for that. She told me that her parents were willing to pay for it. Her parents have more money than I would know what to do with. Like... millionaries money. I told her that my ex-roommate was taking the test as well. She said that he didn't need to and I snapped saying that, ""I guess I can wait another 6 months. Because they won't put my name on the birth certificate until they prove I'm the father."" She finally agreed with me and made him take the test as well.

There's a place around here that actually specializes in DNA testing, so we were able to get in just a couple days later. SHE BROUGHT HER MOM WITH HER! They told us that they would have the results in 10 days and that we could come pick them up or they could mail them to us, we said we would pick them up in person.

I was too nervous to go to the results. Emily and Trevor both went in place for me. According to them, my ex wasn't happy that I wasn't there and almost refused to let them see the results, but her mom told her that she could understand why I didn't want to be there.

I'll never forget that phone call from Emily

E (Emily): Hey!

M (Me): Well...?

E: You're not the dad! You should have seen the look on your ex-roommate's face though! **He's the dad, I didn't make this clear. Sorry!**

*At this point I squealed like a little girl.*

My ex attempted to text me later and I just ignored all of them. Both of her parents did text me though saying that they wish me well with teaching. That really meant a lot to me.

As for other things in my personal life... I've gotten a new apartment over by Trevor and Emily. My ex doesn't know where I live at the moment, her number is blocked, she's blocked on facebook, and everything else that I could think of to block her on.

I've joined a summer baseball league and I play for that 2 times a week. I'm volunteering in the preschool classrooms on campus in the mornings. My job is giving me more hours (requested). I'm taking 3 summer classes, and I'm the ASL tutor for the summer classes now that they have started. I also bought a bike, and now I ride that daily as well. I also got a kitty. His name is Jasper. And I read a lot more now. I realize that I wasn't reading as much as I normally did while I was with my ex, but I've gotten back to reading!

My friends are saying that I'm too busy now and that I have even less time than I did when I was with my ex. I like that. The busier I stay, the less I think about her, and the happier I am. There's a week between the summer classes that I'm tutoring this summer, and Emily, Trevor, Emily's best friend and I are going on a 5 day hiking/camping trip.

I want to say thank you for everybody that helped me through this. The support that you've all given me has really helped me. There are still the people that are saying ""This isn't true"", but I'm receiving a lot more positive support than negative.

No, Emily and I are not going to date. For the many people that have asked, I'm sorry to disappoint you and say that we're not. I don't see her in a romantic way, and I plan on staying single for a while.

I'll be finishing up my BS in Elementary Education this upcoming school year, and then I still need to decide whether to continue schooling and pursue my MS in Deaf Education and Deaf Studies, or whether I should start teaching.

46,LadyGrey90,Non-Romantic,bctq5b,5279,"One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.

It's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.

A year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.

Ever since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.

The wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.

I feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.

The trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.

Now when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.

I'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.

I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.

I've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.

I do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.

But I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?

Edit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.

Edit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!

I have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.

Opinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.

In terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.

It does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.

It's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.

I will post an update of what happens, thank you again!

I'd like to begin by thanking everyone who left some input; I was overwhelmed by the response. Just know that I did read every single comment.

It hasn't been very long at all; I know that. And I truly don't know what the future holds. But here's what has happened in the past ten days or so. 

I admit, I should have talked to Charlie earlier before heading ""to bed"" again, but I was embarrassed about broaching the subject and still ruminating over the advice. 

And so, his anxiety flared again during sexy time that night. Rather than immediately falling into comforting him, I began asking him why he was feeling like he was and resisting the instinct to ""make it all better.""

It was a little more tough love than I've ever been with him (and we haven't been together all that long), but it got him to open up. 

I did flat-out tell him (in a nice way) that this was getting in the way, that we had to solve this sooner rather than later, and that I didn't like him accusing me of being untruthful in-bed. 

And he responded to that, apologized, and agreed that we could not go on like this.

What actually started coming up as we talked were some things I hadn't considered. 

He was tired at the end of work, distracted by stresses from earlier in the day, finding it challenging both physically and mentally to stay focused and creating this self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of being distracted and unable to be a satisfying partner was doing just that.

He was also very embarrassed to not be in the mood sometimes, and I do think that was tied in to the ""failure"" mindset. If he didn't feel like getting going, he was failing me as a partner. I asked him to be open with that.

I also told him that we didn't have to go all the way every time if there were other ways to enjoy the moment. 

And then on to concrete solutions. 

Long story short, Charlie and I have spent the last ten days or so just relaxing together at night and reserving early mornings for intimacy (thanks, /u/NerdWithoutACause). Less stress, less fatigue, and it's been a rather amazing physical solution.

No anxiety flares yet on this revised schedule, when we can do it first-thing and not be under the stress of a long day. But time will tell if this will keep up, I suppose.

Charlie did have therapy three days ago, and he allowed me to look at the notebook he had brought with him. 

He'd brought this all up, and there were some more ""in the moment"" solutions for when his anxiety flared. He's been very open about making the greater effort to control his symptoms on his own without relying exclusively on me.

Waking up to him this morning, he also rather bashfully told me he was feeling under the weather and would prefer if we just cuddled. So we did. And other PG-13 stuff eventually came. It was nice, and I think I have hope.

tl;dr: Resolved to stop comforting boyfriend in bed when his anxiety flared, and realized that outside stressors were part of his flares. We do it in the morning now when there are less of those stressors, and he's working harder in therapy and being more vocal about what he's feeling in the moment. I'm a happy camper for now.

I told my brother everything and showed him all the texts as almost all of you told me to do so. He was shocked. For a few minutes I couldn't say what he was thinking but after that he told me that I should have told him sooner, and that he will make sure our father never bothers us again. For a moment I thought he was upset at me but he was really furious at our father.

He asked our father to come over and told me to remain in my room until he leaves. They ended up having a big fight and they were loud which I could hear. Father was yelling that a parent has a right to raise his daughter as he sees fit, brother told him that he doesn't even know how to spell the word parent. He eventually left. He sent me a text that ""your brother is way over his head, don't choose him over your own father"". I replied (with my brother's permission) that ""I'll choose him over a thousand sperm donors like you. I don't want to see you ever again"". And then I blocked his number.

I'm very happy that my brother did this. I feel much better and safer now. He's always made me feel safe. When he has his own kids I'm sure he will be the most amazing father in the world as he has been one for me.

He said that he'll also inform the police and school, and if my father tries anything I should tell him immediately to maybe look for some legal way to keep him away.

I just hope that my sperm donor of a father stays away from us forever.

I just wanted to come back and update and say, all of you were right. I should have left that night. Not too long after posting that, the emotional abuse finally turned physical. I was held hostage in my home for over an hour while I was assaulted, demeaned, and scared for my life. I left that night. 

It was a hard road. I?ve questioned myself, my sanity, and sometimes even whether I did the right thing. Emotional abuse took a huge toll on my psyche and self-worth. 

I am happy to say, though, that life has drastically improved for the better. I bought a new home for my kids and I. We?ve got a sweet dog and two precious kitties. My son just started 2nd grade and really enjoyed his first day. Everything is falling into place. I feel horrible for what I put them through, and I know there will probably be rough patches ahead, but we are infinitely better off than where we were. 

If you read my original post and it resonates for you, please take the advice of the commenters. Get. Out. Leave. No one deserves that sort of treatment, and it?s only going to get worse.

Who is in the right?

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a88m1g/is\_my\_24f\_mother\_56f\_overreacting\_about\_me/).

So Christmas has been and gone, and there was a bit more drama than I wanted. After my original post I contacted my mother to reaffirm to her the reasons we wanted to spend Christmas Day itself on our own, and she said that she understood, and said she looked forward to seeing us on Boxing Day. However, a few hours later I got a call from my father asking why my mother was crying and saying that I?d rung her up screaming and shouting about her interfering with our life. I said that nothing like that happened, and that it hurt that she was accusing me of that when I was just trying to be mature about the situation. My father sympathised, and said he?d try to talk to her about it.

I checked in frequently in the days up to Christmas, but my mother read and ignored my messages. Whenever I spoke to my father he said that she was telling him I hadn?t been in contact and she was waiting for me to apologise, but he had seen that I was in her call and text history. He advised that visiting on Boxing Day might not be the best idea, but if it got to that stage he would visit us alone since none of this was our doing.

We had our own private Christmas Day, during which we found out that I was pregnant! We had started trying for our first child in secret a few months ago, but didn?t suspect anything until I felt sick at the smell of turkey! We?re going to keep this our little secret for the next few weeks at least with everyone, my husband?s family included. I texted my mother to wish her a Happy Christmas in the morning, and sent another text in the evening asking if she still wanted us to go up to visit tomorrow - I got a one word reply, ?no?. We took my mother at her word and we didn?t visit the following day - I think she was expecting me to grovel at her feet begging for forgiveness, but that?s not going to happen anymore. I called my father and told him that she had decided that we weren?t visiting and it definitely wasn?t on our end. He visited in the afternoon and brought the dog, and we all went for a walk instead of worry about what my mother was doing or saying to other people about it. Apparently a horde of her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things, but I?m done worrying about what my mother says. I?m not at this stage going to completely cut her off or say she can?t see her future grandchild, but our relationship is definitely strained.

Hi! So this wasn?t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. 

The evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said ?baby, there anything I can do to be better for you??. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said ?idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we?re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.? He seemed a little fake surprised and was like ?really? Oh I didn?t know I did it so much and so obviously.? I didn?t want to push the agenda so much because I know he?s a thinker and will think about it even if we don?t discuss it further.

The next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he?s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven?t seen any overt staring at both men and women.

Thank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.

53,TAPJMA,Personal issues,a67rsj,5044,"I placed my son up for adoption almost 16 years ago. It was a decision I came to on my own but it did come with the added pressure of my mom specifically telling me I would no longer be her daughter if I choose to keep my baby. This was huge for me because I am an only child. It was the most difficult thing to do and I struggle with the emotions of it daily. 

It was an open adoption and I have the ability to reach out and get pictures/updates whenever I like. I did that for a few years but then it just became easier to move on by not knowing. I knew I had made the right decision and the family taking my son was amazing. 

I also ended up not speaking to my mother for six years after because of the way she treated me during my pregnancy. It took years of therapy and a lot of forgiveness to even be in the same room as her. I made peace with her for the sake of the rest of our family (i.e. cousins, aunts, grandma's).   


At the same time my mothers health was deteriorating and I found out through some family she wasn't working, had divorced her second husband and was homeless living in her car.  

I had moved away and was doing well enough financially. I succumbed to the guilt provided by my family and agreed to move her in with me and help her get the proper care. It wasn't ideal but I made it work. Got her healthy and got her into some housing and our relationship has been ok. 

Fast forward to July of 2018. I had lost my job, and in general things weren't working in my favor. Mid-life crisis status but with all things I knew this too would pass and a year from now this would not matter.  I had a plan of action and knew things would get better I just needed time. 

Things did get better, got a new job, moved to a new city, celebrated my birthday and on vacation until January 2nd. Things were great up until this morning. 

I'm visiting out of town with some family, which includes my mother. My mom approached me about having issues with her computer/phone I paid for/bought and asked if I could help. 

She handed them over and I started troubleshooting. As I'm going through I notice her computer has several tabs open and I start closing things and un-cluttering the mess. Next thing I see is an open email from August between the man who adopted my child and my mother. She is basically telling him how bad my life is because of her and her health issues and I lost my job and she needs to speak with him to ask for any kind of help. The last email is them exchanging phone numbers. 


I'm beyond upset now and don't even know what to do or say going forward. I've locked myself in the bedroom and trying to wrap my head around this. Thanks for reading.

First let me say that when I wrote my first post I was obviously in a very bad place.  That night's incident was very fresh on my mind and the pain I was feeling at that moment was more than I could handle.  I typed that out, which was cathartic to me, then decided to crawl into a bottle of Jim Beam.  I called in sick yesterday from work, which was not a lie as I had the hangover from hell and spent time alternating vomiting and laying with an ice bag on my head.

I finally opened up reddit last night and to say that I was overwhelmed would be a massive understatement.  I could not believe the number of messages I had in my inbox.  I lost count to be honest with you but it was way in excess of 1 k.  

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  There were so many people who opened up to me about their own experience either being the victim or being the s/o of a victim.  Each of your story's touched me more than I could say.  One in particular got to me and I'm not going to lie I sat at my keyboard and cried for 20 minutes reading his story.  It was so eerily similar to mine that it was as if it was happening to me all over again.  However this was written from an older gentleman who went through virtually the same thing and had to make similar choices.  Thank you sir, I won't share any details since that was sent to me in confidence but you truly touched me.

That all being said here I am today.  Although universally I was told I was not an asshole and not in the wrong it still doesn't feel right.  I feel like an absolute failure and that if I would have just been more assertive early on in the process that we could have changed things.

I don't think I made it clear enough how much I loved and still love her.  Letting this relationship go is like saying I have to lose an arm.

I haven't eaten any solid food since Sunday night, I know I have to quit drinking (yes I called into work again today) but right now feeling numb is better than what I feel like I have to do.  

Before I go over my intentions I do want to clear up a couple of things.  As I said I wrote that while I was still very upset and hurt so I think I was probably either not clear enough or maybe painted a couple of people in a bad light.

First to her parents.  Yes, I've known her parents since 3 weeks into our relationship.  They have never been anything but kind to me and we have eaten at their house twice a month since we have been together.  My family has always celebrated Christmas on Christmas eve so I have spent 3 of the past 4 Christmas's at her house with them.  I do not fault or blame them.  Their child was brutalized and traumatized so they circled the wagon around her, which while I do not have any kids I certainly understand that she was top priority to them.  Her Dad has been as hurt as anyone by this and I have been heartbroken to see this giant of a man (he's honest to God 6'6"" tall) broken like this.  Her Sister has honestly been my lifeline.  She has talked with me and has always tried to be as open as she can with me.

Yes, they knew about the cheating and that is why I got the runaround.  No they did not support her decision to do this however they did not want to be involved other than be there for her.  

Second her therapist might be incompetent, I have no way to judge that.  However in rereading what I typed I think I made it come out worse than it really was.  She did not try and excuse what she did nor did she try and justify it, like I implied.  After a few seconds of awkward silence that was only interrupted by my crying she said that ""some women"" do that.  Also I did read where some people thought it was the therapist who recommended she do this and that couldn't be farther from the truth.  My g/f told her in therapy what she had done and she is the one who convinced my g/f to tell me, they both agreed to do it there so she felt safe.  

I just wanted to clear those two things up because I did not do either of them any justice.

My g/f is/was my best friend.  I confided in her for everything.  I have some work associates that I am friendly with but I am hundreds of miles from where I grew up and all of my friends are there and either are married or very career driven so I don't have what you would call a real support network.  My sister has been there for me to a point but there is a real complication to that even.  My g/f and my sister are best friends, in fact its how I met my g/f.  So while my sister loves me and wants what's best for me she is also very sympathetic to her friend and doesn't want me to do anything to hurt either of us.  She does not support her in the cheating but has tried to basically smooth that over.  She does NOT know though that we (my g/f & myself) have not been together sexually since the rape.  Honestly that is none of her business and I think she would be really disgusted with me if I let her think that this even had anything to do with it.

My g/f has been blowing up my phone with text's since Sunday night.  She is saying everything that I have wanted her to say since about a month after the rape.  I've gotten more ""I love you's"" in the past day than I have in the past year.  I've only responded twice to her.  So she does know I'm reading them.

That is making the next part very hard to do.  I came to the decision last night/early this morning that for my own mental well being I can't do this anymore.  Believe me when I say that I know what a failure it is and how horrible it makes me feel.

So here is my plan.  I know it is chicken shit on my part but I have typed a letter and I am going to send it to her therapist (along with a note to the therapist explaining what to do) for my g/f to read in her office.  That way there is immediate support for her.  I don't want her to be anymore abandoned than what I am going to be doing, that is heartbreaking to type btw.

When she goes for her appointment Friday morning I will then send emails to her parents and a text to her Sister informing them of what is happening so that way they can be there for her when she gets out.  

Here is word for word the letter I have written her, the only thing that is different is that I am no using her or her therapist real names here.  Please read it and let me know if I am out of line or if I am to cruel or if this will trigger any type of mental trauma related to her rape.  I have zero intention of inflicting any more pain than what is normal with a breakup.

Dear Sara,

I know that this is not the best way of doing this but honestly if I had to look you in the eyes I know I could not go through with this.  I have loved you since the first month we have been together and the first three years of our relationship were the best three years of my life.  You were my everything and I know that we had both talked about marriage a lot and I know and believe with all of my heart that we were going to be married.

Nothing would have made me any more happy or proud than to be called your husband.

I don't know how to say this because every fiber of my being does not want to say this but for my own mental health going forward I have to let you go.  Believe me when I say that decision did not come easily to me nor can I say that it is not heartbreaking on my end.  I have always and still love you, but I can't be with you anymore.

You need to heal and you need to be able to 100% focus on you while you are healing and having to worry about me and my feelings is only getting in the way of your healing.

I will always hate the bastard who did this to you.  He has ruined so many lives that life in prison seems a lot more appropriate than what he got.  But I don't get to make that call.  I know holding onto hate is not healthy but he has ruined my life as well as yours.

I know you are going to hate me for this, I don't blame you at all.  I know that you feel abandoned but please understand I have done everything in my power to be there for you.  I wanted to be more involved in your healing but for whatever reason I was somewhat excluded from being a significant part of your inner circle.  This has left me feeling very lonely and alienated from you and your family.  I wanted nothing but the best for you and wanted to be there for you and I hope I was whenever you would let me.

I won't lie, you seeking comfort in the arms of another while still to this day denying me any affection has weighed very heavily on me.  I did then and I do now forgive you but forgiving does not take away the soul crushing pain that comes along with that.  I understand to a point why you might have done it, I don't agree with it and I never will, but I maybe see why.

However that has nothing to do with the fact that we are one year and a month past your incident and you still treat me as though I did something wrong or will do something wrong to you.  When you withdrew the other night from my attempt at a kiss I knew then that you were still in need of healing and I have no idea how long that will be.  But I can't put my life on hold indefinitely, which is where we are still.  I know it is very selfish of me but I need affection, I need both mental and physical intimacy.  Our conversations have been both generic and bland for the past year, which believe me I can understand why.  But we used to spend hours talking about our future and what we wanted.  Now at best we talk about what movie's we want to watch.  

What I am doing is in no way because of what happened to you.  That event was horrible and was life changing for you and I never ever had a second thought about you because of it.  This is all about your recovery and how you have to heal.  For whatever reason, reasons you may not even know yourself, you have completely distanced yourself from me.  I've tried with all of my heart to get back to you but it is painfully apparent that I am no closer to you now than I was right after the incident.

Also to be very clear so you do not think this is about anything else.  The is no one else.  I am not seeing anyone, I don't have eyes for anyone nor do I think anytime soon I will.  I am not now nor have I ever cheated on you.

I hope with all of my heart for you to be fully healed soon.  I want you to be happy.  I hope some day you can look back on our time together with fondness and find it in your heart to forgive me.

I will always love you, this breaks my heart more than you will ever know.

Love,

Chad

I decided to call my dad's bluff and not change the location of the party. They text me a week ago saying I hadn't updated them on the location of the party. I simply said ""Son's party will be on this date and time at our house."" The reply was ""well maybe you all can come by the day after"". I didn't reply and just went about my business. 

The party was yesterday and surprise surprise they still showed up. My dad decided to sit on the back porch the whole time and kept trying to get me to move the cake and sing happy birthday outside (which I did not do) and wanted to get the song out of the way as soon as possible. I was too busy talking to guests and hosting to even entertain him. His wife stayed in the house most of the time and even offered to help with setting things up.

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. Randomly, she said ?I love you?, and explained how grateful she was to be with me. She told me I was making it a lot easier to grieve her brother?s death, and she wouldn?t know what to do without me. She said I was the best boyfriend she could ever wish for and my company alone was helping her tremendously.

I couldn?t believe my girlfriend. She'd witnessed her brother die, was still grieving his death and yet could still find the strength in herself to make my day a little better.

I turned soft -- I felt something inside of me? something I?d never felt before. My eyes started to water. I couldn?t believe it. I was going to cry. My girlfriend saw this, and she couldn't believe it either. That was my trigger. I started bawling. For the first time in my life, I cried. I was embarrassed.

She started crying too, we embraced each other. I cried with her until my tears ran dry. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her because of my lack of empathy. I told her how unfair it was for me to put my emotional distress on her. 

My girlfriend was very receptive. She said it was okay for me to be emotional around her. She said helping me find my lost emotions was the most meaningful thing for her in the world.

My understanding of life has changed for the better ever since that day. I feel like a *real* human being. I?m able to understand what my girlfriend is going through. It took me 8 months, but I?ve finally started mourning the death of my brother. 

My girlfriend has been a lot happier these last few days. She says it?s a direct result of me finding my emotions. This couldn?t have been possible without her. I'm so grateful to have her be a part of my life. My love and undying gratitude for her can't be translated into words. She's the only woman that gave me a chance after hearing about my ?condition?, and the only one to help me with it. I couldn't ask for more from my girlfriend. I love her.

My parents recently gave me an ultimatum - break up with my girlfriend or face them turning their backs on me, prompting me to drop out of university. They are very conservative and religious (Christians) and they said I should only date when I'm done with school.

Growing up I wasn't allowed to date at all. Prior my first girlfriend, I had only kissed one girl. My parents have always been very strict and unrelenting in what they think is right and what they think is wrong. Sex before marriage for them is an absolute no no. I come from Kenya but studying for my BA in England. 

My parents found out I had a girlfriend due to Facebook - yeah, I learned from that mistake, big time - and they flipped. My dad called me and told me to break it off, or else they would stop paying for my BA and I'd be forced to drop out and come home.

Initially, my plan was just to lie them - they are thousands of miles of away and with me being much more savvy with FB privacy settings in the aftermath of what happened, the chances of them finding out I was still with my girl were slim. However, that didn't come to pass because I got very pissed off by what my dad demanded of me.

He required "" physical proof"" that the relationship was over. Over the weekend, he called and demanded that my girlfriend should record a video of herself, saying it was over. 

I'm a shy, reserved person who has always been obedient to my parents. But for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself. I've never spoken back to my parents before but on that day, I did. I told my dad that he wasn't living in the same universe as everyone else and that there was no way I would humiliate and degrade my girlfriend in such a manner. That such a proposal was insane. He then started screaming and shouting at me (characteristically so). I cut the line. He tried calling again - I answered and he continued shouting. I told him I wouldn't talk to him until he started acting in a civil manner. I hung up again and didn't respond to his calls.

He then sent me a string of angry messages, saying he will stop paying for my tuition and that I'm not his son anymore. My mum called me a few hours later and she imitated my dad's angry rhetoric. But I calmed her down and we spoke. I told her that I absolutely love her and my dad, and that I'm grateful for everything they have done for me in life. 

But I stressed the fact that I'm 18, I'm a man living in a completely new country, absorbing a completely new culture and making my own way in life. And that I'm old enough to have a girlfriend. I told her my girlfriend makes me happier than I've ever been, that she got me out of isolating myself in my room during those first weeks, when I was too shy to meet new people and make new friends. She continued to object, and went to the extreme justification of her reservations - pregnancy. Going so far as asking whether we had slept together! I told her that respectfully, it's none of her business. 

After that she hung up on me. I didn't hear from my parents until yesterday. It was my mum. She said she and my dad will continue paying for my tuition, but that they are very disappointed in me and  they regret sending me off to Europe to study - that it was better for me to go to a Kenyan uni. She added they raised me to be a better man and that the path I'm going down isn't right.

I was planning to go to Kenya for the Christmas break but with the way things are, I don't think I will. My older sister lives in Seattle and she said I'm welcome to stay with her over the Christmas break. But that will probably be too expensive of a proposition for me. My girlfriend is Norwegian and she said she would love it if I spent Christmas with her and her family back in Norway. Her parents would be cool with it. Norway is a much more realistic destination for me. It's much closer than the States and thus much cheaper.

**tl;dr**

I'm not gonna lie, I kinda feel bad. I mean I'm happy that I stood up to them and it was such a relief. However, some of the things my parents wrote and said kinda stung. Was I wrong in my approach with them?

58,numbthrowaway12,? Locked Post ?,2p3ih6,4928,"I was signed into this account on my laptop and noticed I received PMs asking for an update to my [post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2or7bz/single_father_38m_with_daughter_17f_discovered/). So, here it is. 

I had a long talk with my daughter Sarah that night. I sat her down and described the circumstances of the discovery. I explained that I was worried because it's a large sum of money and I didn't want her savings to be stolen. 

Well, turns out the elderly neighbor, Anne, has been giving her cash for the better part of a year now. Anne wanted her to have the money to help with college expenses, and told Sarah to keep it a secret from me because I've always refused to accept money from her. Sarah also told me that part of the money was her own. She had been saving up for my birthday present and didn't want to put it in the savings account because, well, she'd have to ask me and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. 

Later in the conversation, I brought up the expensive clothing. Those were throwaways from her friend's mother. Her friend is really tall so she couldn't wear them and gave them to Sarah instead. They needed some slight alterations so she hasn't worn them yet. I apologized for snooping and explained that as a father, I was obviously concerned for her well-being. I also assured her that we are financially stable and that I've put aside enough money for her college expenses. I told her to keep an eye out for Anne, to make sure that her welfare is not affected by the money she's paying Sarah. Also, I asked her to write a thank-you card to her friend's mom and to include a present for her at Christmas this year.  

After the revelations, I wanted to reward her for her savings habit, so I offered to start a checking account for her and we looked into the options online. Turns out, the bank I use offers a junior checking which I can co-sign (overdraft fees, etc) for her. It turns into her own personal account at 18. She'll have the use of a debit card, the bank also offers an online-based financial planning guide, so she will read that before starting the account. We're going to the local branch to set that up for her this weekend.

Sarah seemed to reflect well to our talk. She took the opportunity to reveal that she has been in a relationship for a couple of months. I've actually met her girlfriend a few times before, they go to the same school and I just thought they were good friends so that was a surprise. So yes, she came out of the closet to me. 

Being a dad, I still verified the clothing story with her friend's mom. Overall, I'm happy it was just me dramatically overreacting. However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess. 

P/S: I didn't reduce her allowance but did encourage her to keep saving because it's an excellent habit.

**tl;dr**: Money from neighbor, clothes from friend's mom, so she's getting her own checking account. She also disclosed she's in a relationship. Worst of all, my tortured soul is left wondering what she's buying for my birthday.

I've been back to her grave three times and he's been there every time. Just sitting there. The first two times I left, because I didn't want to bother him, but yesterday I went over and talked to him. We went to a bar and talked some more.

I'm not going to pretend to know the guy, I had only talked to him 5 or 6 times prior to this. But he seems like the type of guy who keeps to himself, with not too many friends. He's also a bit of a nerd. He reminds me of myself actually, which is part of the reason I feel the need to help in some way. When we were at the bar he said a few somewhat alarming things , but these two stuck out: ""she was all I had... I have nothing left"" and ""I'm lost without her.""

I suggested therapy, told him that it's helped me in the past, but he had no interest in it. I offered to let him stay at my house, I can't imagine its very nice sleeping in the apartment that she died in, but he declined. I'm not really sure what to do. He said things that made me think he might commit suicide, but I don't know him that well so I can't be sure. He just seemed so gloomy. Advice is appreciated.

60,brittslipstick,Updates,a8f7d1,4903,"Hey guys,

It has been about 4 months since I made my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9641hl/my_36f_boyfriend_50m_cancelled_our_holiday_and/) so I thought I would update.

TL:DR - We broke up.

After he returned home from his (our?) holiday, I tried to raise some of the issues that were pointed out to my by people who commented on my original post, which all boiled down to a reality that basically our relationship is really only a relationship to me and that for him I am just providing the ""girlfriend experience"" without being able to expect or enjoy any kind of commitment. 

He defended his actions and did manage to generate a pretty impressive list of ways he has been there for me over the past 4 years. But as I learned from you wise people, he is really only there for me when it is on his terms, and when he is being ""so sweet"" it is likely an act, whereas the rest of the time he is just being himself. 

We broke up a couple of weeks after he returned home. I will admit that it was devastating for me and I really had to go through a grief process for the loss of how I hoped things might turn out. Until about a week ago, he would not leave me alone. He left me daily gifts at my home (actually inside of my home until I made him give me back my key). He recruited my friends to do little surprises for me, knowing I hadn't had the heart to tell people about our break up at that point. It was humiliating. When it was my birthday, he sent a lavish gift based on a sexy inside joke of ours. He came to my work place (he is a consultant there, I am on the payroll) and acted as though we are together, making me cry in the bathroom at how awkward it was because I hadn't told my colleagues about our split at that point. And worse of all, I took myself to a hot country to have a solo vacation - all ""sister doing it for herself"" - and he had the nerve to JOIN ME at the place I was staying after he found out about it from others. When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me. He ruined a vacation I really needed, and I embarrassed myself crying many tears in a beautiful, tropical paradise surrounded by people in love, or at least that's how it seemed.

I realize how horrible he sounds when I write all of this out, but we did have many good years together, including a lot of fun doing a shared hobby that not a lot of people are into and that is super time consuming. I'm not sure how to face him in our mutual spaces anymore. I don't know what switched off for him to finally give me space, but it has helped immensely for me to heal and get over this without him lurking around or love-bombing me to try to get me to change my mind. After the vacation fiasco, I know that he is only reaching out because he misses the convenience I brought to his life, not because he misses me or cares about me, or he never would have done such a rude, selfish thing.

I am posting mainly as a thank you to those of you who took the time to reach out and share your perspectives with me, both gently and not-so-gently. I am not sure how I was recruited into allowing him to treat me that way, and I'm working with a very fantastic therapist to learn more about who I am in relationships. It will be hard to spend the holidays without him and I miss his kids a lot, but it is such a good feeling to know that I have a fresh start. I've been enjoying the holiday parties with family and friends this year, and have met a couple of really cute men who are close in my age, seem emotionally available, and are immersed in interesting, creative careers. They flirt with me like I'm a real person - you know, talking and asking questions instead of just compliments and being taken to events like the token ""I got dumped by my wife but check out this hot babe who loves me"" type of girlfriend. I'm being careful and oh so slow, but guys, oh so hopeful too.

I am very grateful for your help. I hope you have a lovely holiday and a wonderful new year.

Here is what has happened since posting: 

- We?ve spent time apart, and time together. We had one great blowout. When I told him he needs to cancel his trip, he told me to ?fuck off? and ?he needs to do this for himself?. I told him I plan to fuck off. Still denying seeing the woman this weekend.

-Miscellaneous shit: found a receipt thatincluded a new box of condoms, then found condoms. We don?t use condoms. He still talks to the other woman daily, and is currently helping her with her resume. 

-I told him I?m done, etc., and he?s looking for an apartment.

-He left for Denver this morning. He hugged me and tried to kiss me (?!) but it landed in my hair because I pulled the hell back.

-I am talking to lawyers next week- an immigration lawyer and a divorce lawyer.

-I am considering changing the locks this weekend while he?s off doing God knows what.

-The lies have continued (he didn?t buy those condoms!) , and the absolute disrespect has continued as expected. I?m still having moments of absolute heartbreak , and there are still some days I can?t get out of bed.

62,wheresmyroom,Non-Romantic,6e6hge,4877,"Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do.

So I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met ""Lana"" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this).

Our flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.

Because of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say ""this would be *your* room"".

We moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.

Just over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.

I came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled ""what the fuck?"" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.

I walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said ""Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it."" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said ""And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point."" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said ""We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back"" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.

I've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as ""okay let's swap now you're home.""
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?

EDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say ""Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)"" (Yes I'm petty.)

I'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.

EDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.

**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**

**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a ""coffee"" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**

**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold ""hi"" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted ""did you do it!?"" and I said ""what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course."" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**

**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**

**She burst into tears and said ""Omg he's going to kill me"" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the ""what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah"" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like ""ring me in the next five minutes or we're over"" ""send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work"", just abusive stuff.**

**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**

**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**

**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming"" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him"" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**

**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**",1496139618.0,"I've [F25] returned from a month long trip and my roommate [F22] has moved all her things into my room and has been living there, with no intention of switching back.",0.98

First off, I wanted to thank everybody who commented on my original post. Most of you guys wanted me to call the number Sandra was constantly texting and I honestly was about to. She came home an hour after I had posted the original post. I was almost asleep by then and I guess she thought I was asleep. She took out her phone and unlocked it. I saw her password. 

Eventually she fell asleep and I unlocked her phone and searched the number on her phone. The number belonged to some guy named Jeff and the text messages were extremely sexual. Some examples:

From Jeff: I loved the way you bounce when we fuck.

From Sandra: I love it when you go down on me.

Those were just 2 examples of the sexts between them, but there was a hell of a lot more. I screenshotted a ton of them and sent them to myself. 

At this point, I was done with her. I confirmed that she was cheating on me. So I decide to snoop some more and looked through her photos. They were a couple of photos of her kissing and cuddling with some guy, who I assume is the same guy she's been cheating on me with. Of course I also send those photos to myself. But what threw me over the edge was a video of her (I assume one of her friends were recording this) giving some guy head. I almost lost it and woke her up to confront her, but I calmed down. Of course, I also sent the video to myself. 

At this point I went for a walk for nearly 2 hours. Mind you this is the middle of the night and the area I walked through isn't the safest of areas. Still, I didn't care. I was so angry.

Eventually I calmed down enough and went back to our place. I slept for maybe 3 hours and woke up. I printed off some of the sexts and photos and waited for her to get up.

She finally got up at about 6AM. When she finished eating breakfast I slammed the text messages on the table. She looked at me with horror. She started crying and shaking. I took the engagement ring from our dresser and walked out. 

I came back a couple of hours later and she wasn't there. I called my landlord and told him we wouldn't be renewing our lease. I told her I was moving out and to never contact me again. I packed all my shit and moved in with a friend.

So yeah that's it. She was cheating on me and I'm done with her. She's been blowing up my phone begging for a 2nd chance, but she's not getting one.

Original TLDR: I have a crush on a friend but I'm totally clueless as to whether his behavior signifies any mutual interest or not. He's also a bit quirky and I almost can't imagine him wanting a relationship, but he confuses me a little bit.

I figured I'd update to encourage anyone in the same boat as I was. I asked him out over email. I translated ""Will you go out with me? I really like you"" into unicode. He responded (also in unicode) that he would and also sent some ASCII art.

We have our first date this afternoon and texted all weekend (I finally got his number).

I invited my mom to lunch so that we could discuss what happened at the party and where to go from there. I explained to her that my sister stole a very expensive watch from me. It wasn't just some trinket, and it shouldn't matter even if it was. I tried to pull her away and confront her in private, but she chose to yell and curse at me and cause a scene. I also told her that I understand it is never okay to look into someones private purse or bag, but that sort of etiquette goes out the window when tens of thousands of dollars of my stolen property is in her purse. 
My mom then went on a long rant about how we are all family and that her and my sister believe that a family should share in each other's success. She tole me that my sister was just upset because I was ""hoarding"" all of my money for myself and that it's understandable what she did. She said that I would never gotten where I am today without all the work she put into raising me and the influence her and my sister had on my life. Then she went on to tell me that I ""owe"" it to her to evenly share my success with her and my sister since we are family and they would certainly do the same in my position(that's a laugh) 
At this point I'm pretty dumbfounded. Not only because she thinks my sister's actions were somehow justified, but because she credits herself for my success and thinks it's selfish of me not to share with her and my sister. And don't even get me started on her trying to act like her and my sister would do the same. I know for a fact my sister wouldn't give me a dime if I were 10 cents shorts for a heart transplant. And my mom still owes me tens of thousands of dollars that she borrowed and swore she would pay back(I don't expect it back and wrote it off as soon as I gave it to her) 
I just can't even fathom how my mom could actually think like that. At that point I was so furious and didn't want to say anything I'd regret, so I got up and walked out. Oh yeah, I also got a text half an hour later saying that I owed her money for lunch since I was the one who invited her. Despite the fact that neither of us had even ordered before I left.

As far as my sister goes, I haven't contacted her and she hasn't contacted me. At this point I'm just done with her in my life. I don't know if I should do the same for my mother though. I would hate to not have a relationship with her, but I just can't believe how she could possibly think those things. Would love some advice on what to do as far as my relationship with my mother goes. Thanks. 


   
**tl;dr**: 
Had lunch to talk with my mom about what happened.
She claimed that my sister was justified in what she did because she was upset that I wasn't sharing my money with her.
Told me that we are a family and should share in each other's success and that I am being selfish by not doing so. 
I got up and walked out


END OF TLDR.  I thought that putting edit/update in front of the newly added parts would make it clear, but I keep letting angry complaints about how the TLDR is so long. 






Edit: Small update I thought I'd post. She called me but I didn't want to talk so I let it go to voicemail. She left a voice mail telling me to check my email. Here is her email: ""First of all, it was very rude of you to walk out on me at the cafe. I was humiliated and you should know better than to treat your mother like that. As I said in the text, you owe me money for lunch since you were the one who invited me so please bring $60 to give to me at Craig's BBQ. It is a shame that I even need to be telling you this, I know I raised you better than that. But you really need to start supporting this family. We are all one, and the success of any individual needs to be spread around the family. Your sister works as a pastry chef and is always more than happy to bake for everyone and bring us treats from work, I wish you would do the same. You can start out by helping me with the new apartment I'm moving to. The rent is $4250 per month(not including utilities) I am planning on moving in around the first of September so that gives you plenty of time to set up some sort of monthly bank transfer. I'm going to need $8500 in about 2 weeks for the first and last months rent. I'll also need you to come over a few times this month to help move my stuff over there. Bring the bigger truck, unless that's the manual because Tod doesn't know how to drive stick. As a thanks for moving my things over there I will cover the security deposit myself so you don't even need to worry about it. 
And you still haven't apologized to (sisters name) so please get that done this week. It will take 5 minutes tops so just get it done. It was wrong to humiliate her like that and guess you had to be the one comforting her. Me! Like usual. 
Text me to confirm that you got everything and let me know how soon you can bring the big truck over.

I should also mention that I currently pay for her rent. After some long guilt trip about how she gave me free food and housing for 18 years so it's time for me to repay the favor. I can clearly see now that that was a big mistake. Now she just assumes I'm going to pay her rent at some new huge place that costs twice as much and that she doesn't need? At this point I'm done giving her any support, she clearly as no appreciation for it. 


That's just a taste of how my mom acts. She is extremely entitled and just expects everything in life to be given to her. 






Edit: Another update. So I just sent my mom an email letting her know that I will not being giving her any more money.Here's the gist of it:

""I will not be paying the rent for the new more expensive apartment you want to move in. Not only will I not be paying for that, but I won't be paying your rent for any apartment anymore. You will have to do that yourself. In addition to that, I will not be giving you *any* money whatsoever. You have shown that you have no respect for me or the work it takes to earn money and I cannot continue to pay for things you don't need. I know this means cutting back a bit, but there is no reason for you to be living outside your means and I won't subsidize your expensive lifestyle.""
I wrote it all out completely different, but that's the gist of what I told her.

67,SugarCoatThis,Breakups,9kznlb,4802,"I?m kind of in shock right now. I decided yesterday to end my 9 month relationship...we have been arguing constantly recently and it was turning toxic. It had got to the point where my bf said his mom has overheard our arguments and he said she thinks I treat him like shit. (Im not sure if this is entirely true as his mom has always been absolutely lovely to me) Regardless i was so mortified to hear that, embarrassed and ashamed,  so I said that is a prime example of why we shouldn?t be together. He said it didn?t matter what anyone else thinks and he wanted to work through things. In my mind though things had gone too far and we needed to split.

I told him in person yesterday when I was at his house that we needed to break up , that the arguing was too much and it wasn?t good for either of us . Id brought his belongings that he?d left at mine and I tried to be as nice as possible. He turned on me and said ?no way, you?re not doing this to me you fucking idiot. How dare you come round here with the intention of breaking up? Are you mental? Are you sick in the head?? He called me the most disgusting names. 

I said I needed to leave and I was sorry but he locked the front door and wouldn?t let me go. It was only us two in the house at the time. I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn?t. Instead he started to interrogate me about the reasons I wanted to leave. Kept wanting to know if I?d met someone else and was I leaving him for another guy. I couldn?t get to my cell phone as it was in my purse out of reach so I couldn?t call anyone for help. Then he changed tactic and said  we can work things out, backtracked on the thing he said about his mom, said he loved me and didn?t want to break up. In order to keep myself safe I kept him sweet and I agreed to stay together; he had calmed right down by then and I felt relieved. 

Long story short I?m still with him. He said he wants to come to see me later and make things up to me. He said he will buy us takeout and we will have a nice evening together. I don?t know why he is so intent on wanting to stay in such an awful relationship. He tells me I?m a complete pain in the ass all the time and how he?s had enough of me so why the hell wont he just let me go.

68,throwaway98989609,Personal issues,9du198,4783,"I'm an idiot. I'll try to keep this short. Also, I was a bit drunk when this happened.

Noah and I have been best friends since 2nd grade. We live together with one other friend near the college we go to together. He came out to me when we were in high school. It didn't change anything. When we got to college, I came out as bisexual.

Last night we were hanging out with some friends and I had a bit to drink. When we were walking home I could tell he was nervous so I asked what was up. He asked if I wanted to go out with him. He literally said ""do you want to go out with me"". I don't know why, but I thought he meant as friends. Thinking back he made it really obvious it was a date, but I'm an idiot and I was still a bit drunk. I said yes. He suggested Saturday night. I said yes.

I left to go to the gym before he got up so I didn't see him. While I was at the gym, the friend we live with texted me that Noah was really happy this morning and she didn't know we were going to go on a date. She congratulated me and said we make a cute couple. This happened literally six minutes ago. I'm panicking right now. I don't know what to do. I love him but he's like my brother. I can't go out with him. How can I tell him I'm not interested without embarrassing him more than I have to? I don't want to mess up our relationship. We're supposed to have lunch together in a few hours. What do I do?

tldr: I'm an idiot. My best friend asked me out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date. How do I fix this as easily as possible for him?

UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for the advice. I only saw the first 30 something comments until just now, and I'm blown away by how many people have commented to give me advice. I tried to take a lot of the advice I got, but some of it was contradictory so I couldn't do all of it. Thanks again to everyone who gave advice, even if I didn't see it until after we talked.

I texted Noah and asked if we could skip lunch and go home instead so we could talk. I tried not to make the conversation dramatic. I apologized to him for misunderstanding him, and told him I knew it must have taken a lot of courage for him to ask me out. I told him that he was my best friend, I loved him, and that would never change, but I had never thought about a romantic relationship with him. I apologized for fucking up and getting his hopes up. He asked a few questions, like did I really not know he meant it as a date. He apologized for ""fucking things up"" between us, but I told him that I wasn't uncomfortable with him feeling that way about me. I told him that I understood if he wanted space to process it, and I would give it to him if he wanted, but I also told him how important he is to me and how much I love him. He said he didn't think he wanted space. He just wanted to try to move on with the secret out.

We've always been totally open with each other (well, except for him liking me I guess) and he said he was happy he wasn't keeping his feelings a secret anymore. We had a cheesy moment where I told him he could always talk to me, about anything. It was like straight out of a romcom. We talked for a long time after that. Apparently he's had a crush on me since before he came out in high school, and after he had a few drinks last night he decided fuck it, why not try. By the time he had to leave for his class this afternoon, things felt normal. I don't feel weird knowing about his crush, and he doesn't seem to feel hurt or anything because of my fuck up. Maybe just a little sad. I'll definitely keep an eye on how we interact and how he acts for a while. A few people warned me against accidentally flirting with him, and I'll try to keep anything like that in check.

I guess this is a happy ending. I know there are still things to be aware of, but right now it looks like the conversation went pretty well. Thanks everyone for commenting and supporting.

I wanted to post a quick update because a lot of people here seemed  as annoyed with this caveman as I am. 

I got a ton of great advice (thank-you!), and I started practicing what I would say to his face the next time I ran into him. I also considered alerting the management at the club he chased me out of, but I didn?t have to do that. Apparently he brought it to the club himself and tried to rat me out for my ?rudeness,? but it totally backfired. 

One of the managers approached me a few days ago and said ?Justin? told her about what happened. My stomach sank at first because I thought she was going to encourage me to talk to him, but she said just the opposite. Without even hearing my side she told him that I don?t have to talk to him if I don?t want to. She also said she won?t be booking us on the same shows anymore, and that the staff knows not to allow him into the building on nights I?m performing. She said she wants me to feel safe at the club, and she?s got my back. What a win for sisterhood!

After that, he tried reaching out to my SO who also shut him down and told him to leave us alone. I don?t know if he?s let it go at this point, but I?ve been making notes about everything like some people wisely suggested, and I?m feeling validated and supported.

I've been with Matthew for 3 years now, and we have a perfect relationship. I know everyone says that, but it really is true. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I've only met his family a few times because they live pretty far away and my boyfriend had a huge falling out with his father a couple of years ago. They've since patched things up, but it's still not the same as it was. Matthew is not particularly close to his sister because she's 12 years younger than him and he doesn't see her that often. Of course he still loves and adores her, but they're not a very close family. Jessica has cancer and as a result has lost all of her hair. Matthew was devastated, obviously, and has been going to visit her more often. I have only seen her a few times since, because of work commitments. I have been down twice alone (without Matthew) to visit her in hospital. She?s a lovely young girl and I?m devastated for her and their family.


Jessica is home at the moment and Matthew's mum called last Friday and asked if we could go over there. Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica. My job is modelling. I have very thick, natural auburn hair that reaches my waist. It's one of the reasons that I'm fairly successful. It's one of the reasons I can afford to pay the bills. I couldn?t model without my hair. So I respectfully and politely declined, telling them that it would be detrimental to my career. I don?t have two jobs, I don?t have a back-up, this is my job. It?s my money maker. If I couldn?t model, I don?t know what I would do. 


Matthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important, I cannot afford to lose my hair. I have to think logically about this otherwise I won?t have a roof over my head. Matthew?s mum was very upset, and proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn?t shave my hair because I am vain. I apologised to Jessica and explained my reasoning, and I went home. I have barely spoken to Matthew since it happened as he says he ?needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship.? I told him that I would do anything other than shave my head. I'll do a charity run, I'll raise tons of money, whatever I can possibly do, instead of shaving my head, but he won't listen. All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'.


Did I do the wrong thing? 

tl;dr my career is modelling and part of my success is due to my hair. My boyfriends younger sister has cancer so the family shaved their heads in support of her. I declined, and now everyone hates me.


edit: a few people have asked so I'll copy+paste this from one of my replies: Matthew told me that Jessica is very upset and has told all of their family repeatedly that she hates me for having long hair and refusing to shave it for her. She's only 13 years old though, I have a feeling that the family are perhaps poisoning her view and of course she's going to be having a difficult time as it is. I can't hold any grudges against a young girl being in such an awful situation.


Edit 2: I'm completely overwhelmed by the support here, so thank you a lot. I have read every comment and most of them are very helpful and make me feel a lot better. I am going to give it another few days and then I am going to speak with Matthew and his mum and Jessica. I'll be sure to post an update soon. Thank you again. 


*Edit 3: gosh I hate threads with a ton of updates when there's no real update but I feel the need to defend Matthew's family a little. They're not crazy people. They've always been absolutely lovely and kind and welcoming towards me. They were a normal, happy family before this happened. Their youngest member of the family, the innocent, sweet, vulnerable girl is dying and there's nothing they can do about it other than try to make her happy. Of course their view is clouded, of course they're not being rational. Matthew's mum has quit her job to spend more time with Jessica, they've spent every penny they have on gifts for her. I don't think they're crazy or bad people. They're in a world of hell and the only thing that makes it better is putting a smile on Jessica's face and me shaving my head would have done that. If they don't come to terms with it and start thinking clearly soon, then I will agree with everyone and I will call them crazy and run for the hills, but at the moment, I'm trying to be as supportive as I can to my boyfriend and his family whose hearts are all broken.

So my sister, Allie [F21] let my cat out last week, and I finally snapped at her about her careless behavior. I told her she needed to go stay with Sam, as had been her original plan. She avoided me for a few days and showed up last Friday with our other sister Sam [F20] to pick up some things Sam left at my house and Allie's luggage. They were both really rude to my husband about the whole situation. When confronted about my jewelry, Allie said she'd forgotten to bring it with her. (Yeah, right.)

So this weekend I ask Allie to return it, again and again. She tells me she forgot she had it. (How? I've been asking for it for a week?)

Then Sam says some of her things were missing, and that they'd be keeping my jewelry as repayment. She never said what was missing.

Some background I didn't mention in my previous post is that my other sister, Sam, has been on my bad side for a few months now. I fronted $3k for legal representation for Sam last year, and cut her off financially after she lost her third job and second apartment in a year (relying on me to save her ass each time). She didn't attempt to even meet the criteria for her court case and her lawyer dropped her, meaning I paid $3k on a lawyer she never used. She now has a felony and will do jail time if she ever goes back to Nevada. There's been a growing distance there for a while because Sam's own behavior has been so irresponsible.

I know Sam is sensitive (shout out to /r/raisedbynarcissists) but I have been increasingly firm her behavior isn't okay. The fact that she didn't even meet the criteria for her court case is so unacceptable, especially when that was the stipulation for fronting her the money. She's basically expressed to me that I'm not allowed to be pissed 
about it.

Anyways, Sam sent me some mean texts, told me she and Allie are keeping my jewelry and then told me I should have done a better job when I attempted suicide a few years ago.

So obviously I informed them they needed to return my jewelry by the end of the day or I'd take all the texts about it (where Allie admits to 'accidentally' pocketing it and Sam expresses they'll be keeping it) and my purchase receipts and go down to the police station this morning and I'd be filing a report.

Magically, my jewelry was in my mailbox this morning.

Well the long and short of it is that I've cut them both out. They were the last of my (admittedly very broken) family, but as you can probably tell from these posts, it seems like no one has escaped the toxicity. I was pretty willing to make up with Sam if she ever apologized (she never has) and paid me back (I know she never will). I was happy to help Allie in her time of need but she grossly misrepresented her financial situation and was an incredibly rude and entitled (and thieving) house guest. My family has taken advantage of me time and again, and one by one I've been closing the door on them. Sucks to do it again to the girls I loved the most, but I honestly don't see there ever being a way to repair what they've done and said.

Thanks for all the replies I got before, I needed a little support to get a backbone and stop this madness. When you have such a toxic family you really forget what's healthy and what isn't.

**TL;DR** My sister admitted she took my jewelry, then she and my other sister refused to return it. More entitled behavior ensues and finally when I put my foot down I was told to go kill myself. Magically after threatening to go to the police, my jewelry was returned. Officially cut both sisters out of my life.

After going through all the comments(thanks for the advice!) I decided to send my mother an email letting her know that I will absolutely not be paying for the new place she made plans to move to, and that I will stop paying her rent all together. I told her that she clearly does not respect me or the work I put in in order for me to be in a position to give her the money that I do. I also told her that I would not be financially supporting her in any way. 

A few hours after I sent the email my phone starts blowing up. Calls over and over again. I still really didn't want to talk to her so I ignored them all. A little while later I get a call from my friend Dave, except when I answer the phone it's my mom. I found out later from Dave that she showed up at the bike shop he works at and made up some story about story about her locking her purse with her phone and keys in the car and needing to call me for a ride. 
She immediately goes off on me about how ungrateful I am and that she is disgusted by the email I sent etc. She told me that it's my ""duty"" to make sure she is well cared for and comfortable, as she is the reason I'm here in the first place. The worst part was when she told me that if she knew I was going to end up this way that she wouldn't have put her life on hold for the last 2 decades in order to have me, and that I cost her her job and my dad and a bunch her her life plans. I couldn't even get a word in with all her yelling. The last thing she said was something along the lines of ""you need to have a come to jesus moment and realize how much you are hurting your mother. I have already packed up most of my stuff and have spent a ton of time setting this move up. I expect the $8500 before the weekend is over in a cashiers check so let me know when you have it."" and then she hung up. 
I don't think I have even been so mad in my entire life. She pretty much just told me that I need to make up for everything she missed out on in order to have me by giving her money and making sure she's taken care of. 
I called her back and she tried to start talking and I don't remember exactly what I said because I was so angry but I basically told her to shut the fuck up and let me talk(but with more swearing and yelling) I'm usually pretty calm and would never swear at my mom(I would never even swear near her) and I know I shouldn't have said that but I wasn't thinking straight. I told her she better find another place to live or pay her rent herself because she wasn't getting another dime from me.
I turned my phone off after that because I didn't want to deal with anymore calls or texts. I eventually needed to use my phone so I turned it back on and just blocked her number. I saw that I had some calls/messages from her but I didn't want to look at them.

This morning I got a call from the front desk at my building telling me that my mom had tried get up to my room, but I had already told the elevator staff/security to take her off my guest list. Apparently she caused quite the fuss when they wouldn't let her up. 
She is blocked on my phone now so I haven't heard from her today yet, but I expect her to blow up on me again for what happened this morning. 

I think she's probably in denial and thinks that I will cave and pay for her new place. I'm worried about what she's going to do when the deadline for her to pay for her new place comes up and I refuse to give her any money. The move in date is pretty soon and I'm sure she has to pay it pretty soon, I'm actually surprised she hasn't had to pay already. So that's going to cause a massive shitstorm. I'm really really worried about what she's going to do.

Thanks again for all the advice! 


TLDR: 
Mom showed up at friends work and used his phone to call me because I wasn't answering her.
Yells at me about not doing my duty and how I owe it her to take care of her because I basically ruined her life. 
Says I have to give her rent check by the end of the weekend.
Tell her she isn't getting a dime from me and hang up
She tries to get in my building but isn't allowed.

I have learned several things recently.  First thing is that I had no idea how many English teachers, lit majors and overall editors were actually redditors.  LOL, I had so many posts just correcting my obvious and admitted horrible spelling and grammar that I began to have a complex.  In all seriousness thank you for those of you who took the time to edit that for format, grammar and spelling.  I even appreciate those of you who took the time to provide me with written documentations and reasons as to why my errors were errors.

Second thing I've learned is that this is really a loving and caring community for the most part.  I have been given numbers to call, emails to read and lists of things to read to help me on my journey.  I deeply appreciate the very moving stories I have been told and believe it or not I have read every one of them even though at last count I was close to 2,500 messages.  People have offered to buy me drinks, hang out and I even got one offer for a hand job to relieve my stress which was both flattering and amusing all at the same time.

However the main thing that I have learned recently is to never sign your real name to an open public letter if you don't want it to somehow get back to the people in your life.  It makes it a little hard to deny it was you when every single detail is the same and you use your own dumb ass name.

Many people wanted and update about how things went.  Simply put, it didn't.

In review I had written the letter and then with the help of several redditors had re-written the letter with better format and I did edit out the part that the rapist ruined her because I agreed that this was not an appropriate thing to say.  In fact I almost edited him out altogether other than saying I wish he had gotten a longer sentence.  However I did leave in the part about being her husband.  I know a lot of people wanted me to take that out but I just felt deeply that I had to say that, I can't really explain why.

Of course my intention originally was to mail it to her therapist office with instructions for what to say, but I knew there was zero chance that she would get it in time so I was going to take it to her and see if I could speak with her.

Notice how that was all in the past tense as in what I was going to do?

Well I never got the chance.

Wednesday night, late night in fact, I have a knock on my door.  Lo and behold it is her sister and my sister together.  Her sister was holding papers in her hands and my sister walks in and her sister walks in with her.  Obviously something is up so I ask what's wrong and her sister hands me a print out of my posts and the replies to my previous two threads and she simply asks ""is this you""?

At first I tried to deny it, I couldn't really remember everything I had written in particular the first post so I was kind of trying to avoid any problems if I said something I shouldn't have.

But my sister just straight up got in my face and told me to stop fucking lying, which by then I was caught.  I knew and she new it.  I just dropped my head.

This then led to a very long conversation that lasted till the wee hours of the morning.  At first her sister was very much emotional because of course she loves her sister and was crying asking me how I could want to do this to her.  Much to my surprise though my sister stood up for me here and actually kind of ripped her sister a new asshole.  She said that I had gone way beyond what most people had and that Sara should not one year later still be withholding affection from me.  She had no idea that we still weren't physically as close as we once were, like I said I never told her.

Once my sister got done talking (I'm going to call her sister Susan just so I can stop typing her sister) Susan said that in reality she knew that she was right.  She begged me to not go through with my letter, she said that I had promised to give Sara a week (which I had).  She then gave a very impassioned speech about how much she can tell I still love her and how much she knows she still loves me.  My sister also agreed that there was too much love present in my heart to just do this right away.  She said and it made sense at the time, what is another week compared to what you have been through.  So long story short I agreed to not take the letter over.

Whether it was guilt, regret or love I can't say but I agreed to it.  This then led the single most embarrassing thing in my life happening.  Susan gave me a very big hug and cried as they were leaving.  It's been a very long time since I've had any type of close contact and let's just say its not a lot of fun being called a disgusting pig by your sister.  All I could do was say how very sorry and how embarrassed I was, fortunately Susan seemed to take it in stride.  She just wanted to make sure that I would talk with Sara the next day.

Even though I was a virtual zombie from lack of sleep I went ahead and went to work.  I have lots of PTO time available to me but I didn't want to burn it all up over this in case I needed time later.

I got home from work and my intention was to go straight to bed after eating dinner and maybe watching some tv.  That went to hell in a hurry as I was eating my dinner when my someone is knocking on my door again.  This time is was Susan and Sara.

This time Sara is holding the printout.  You can tell they both had been crying and Susan asked if they could come in.  I just shook my head yes because I was honestly a little nervous and no matter what she has done or not done, seeing Sara emotional always upsets me and she physically looked horrible.  I mean as bad as she did after the rape.  

They set on the couch and sara already has tears streaming down her face.  We all kind of just sat there for what seemed like an eternity looking at each other.  

I wasn't going to speak first, I had no idea what to say or do so I just sat there.  Eventually I broke though and asked Sara if she wanted some water or something to drink.  She actually said yes so I got up and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of ice water and when I turned around she was standing right behind me.

All she said to me was ""are you really going to leave me""?  I couldn't answer, I just looked into her eyes and felt broken and ashamed.  We went and sat down but this time she sat next to me.

She started to read my first post to me but could not make it through it.

Susan jumps in at this point and say's they had spent the day talking and they had gone over the post and most of the replies and said that Sara was very sorry for how she treated me.  She said that they have spoken to their parents and everybody agrees that the way I was treated was not fair.  Seeing it in writing really struck a nerve with all of them because they could see how hurt I was and that even though I could have blamed all of them that I didn't.  Sara is shaking her head yes the entire time.  

Sara then managed to talk and just laid out how she obviously did not give me enough consideration and that she now see's that what she did was horrible to me when I have been nothing but compassionate and loving towards her.  She begged me for another chance she said that sometimes in life you need a kick in the ass to get moving and she said me wanting to break up with her was her wakeup call.  She can't and won't take me for granted and said she had a years worth of apologizing to do to me. 

Susan actually very calmly said that they had spoken at length in the afternoon about her infidelity and then not even touching me.  Sara then replied that she had no real excuses.  She knows that what she did was horrible and that she had no right to ask me for forgiveness but was going to anyway.  She also said that she is making it the top priority of her life that she talk with her therapist to get past any physical limitations she has with me.

This went on for a long time btw.  I could give you a lot more of what was said but this is already a wall of text as it is.

The one thing though that I want to say is that while she was talking to me she was holding my hand.  She reached out and took it.  Now I realize that she read my posts and I made a big deal about that in my posts but whether she did it because she read it or just did it on her own (she used to do that all the time) I won't deny that it felt really good.

They ended up staying the night.  No, before you get any crazy porn movie ideas nothing happened between any of us.  Susan slept on the futon and Sara on the couch and I actually went to my bed.

I called in early Thursday morning to work before I went to bed as I knew that I would not be able to function on so little sleep.

I get awoken around 10 by Sara sitting next to me in the bed rubbing her hands on my arm to wake me up.  She said that they were getting ready to leave because she had moved up her therapy session to 11 and she didn't want to leave without her telling me how much she loved me and to let me know she was coming right back after the session.  

She leaned over and kissed me.  It wasn't a long passionate kiss in fact it was just kind of a quick kiss but right on the lips.  This was a mistake I'm sure because that broke my resolve right there.  Up until that point I was still holding onto the thought that this was all just words and that it took me threatening to leave her to get her to even pay attention to me.  One p.m. I got from a rape survivor kept going over in my head that if she was able to come around because of the threat of me leaving then this was not all due to her emotional trauma because if it was due to that then no threat of me leaving was going to change this.

But between my sister, her sister and her every wall that I was building to protect myself was crumbling and that kiss pretty much was the wrecking ball that tore them all down.

I went back to sleep and around 1 she shows back up at my  place carrying lunch.  Susan was not in tow so it was just going to be the two of us.  We ended up spending the afternoon together.  We ended up spending the weekend together.  Yes you can infer from that what occurred between us.  I'll just say that I was probably more scared about it than she was.  I was worried about triggering anything or saying or doing anything that would upset her.  She on the other hand was very loving and emotional about it.  She cried afterwards for a good long while which caused me to freak but she said it was a combination of joy and regret.  That she had forgotten how love felt and it just kind of overwhelmed her.  We laid there for hours.

She had the recommendation from her therapist for a couples counselor who we are going to start seeing next week.

I know this isn't what a lot of people wanted to read and all I can say is that I'm sorry to disappoint you and yes I am prepared for the plethora of name calling from some people but at the end of the day I have to worry about myself and my happiness here.

For the first time in over a year I have been happy for 4 days.  I know that this isn't the end, that we are still going to have hurdles to overcome.  I honestly believe that this was a wakeup call for her, if not then why go through all of the emotional drama and turmoil.  Wouldn't she just let it go?

Bottom line is I love her, I have always loved her and all I wanted was for her to show me she loved me as well.  This past weekend was a really bonding experience for me and for her as well.  I think we can build something new together.

Thank you reddit, I felt the love from you guys as well.  I am ultimately a very lucky man.

tl;dr;  Got caught with my reddit postings.  My sister and her sister convinced me to not go through with the letter.

This is an update post! Hello everyone! I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice.

Anyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier.
I told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the ""he has work"" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad.

So anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said ""Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad"". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it & that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do.

A few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if ""things got bad"". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her ""you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!"" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said ""if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!"" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said ""I have never seen you so angry!""

I never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :)

Tldr; they broke up!

My family is full of tech illiterate people.  Since I was in high school I've been the go to for fixing tech problems.  If there is an issue they will usually text or call me and they can drop it off for me to look at if its something I can't fix over the phone.  However now I work in IT so I am spending 8-10 hours a day fixing other people's tech issues and now I don't want to spend more time outside of working doing the same thing. 

I explain that if it is something super quick I can help with over text then I'll try, but that anything more than that and I need them to look it up themselves or go to a shop to get it fixed. Most of them were very understanding.  Some were not.  My aunt actually pretended to not see my message explaining my situation to her and she showed up at my doorstep with a box full of things she wanted fixed.  I refused to take them and explained that I don't have time to do these things for them anymore.  She called me selfish and said I don't care about family anymore before she threw the box in her car and drove off.  

The next day I started getting texts from a few other family members that wanted things fixed telling me I was selfish and that ever since I got that new job I've been acting like I'm too good for family.  This really hurt.  I've even been uninvited to a family party I was looking forward to because it is at Aunt's house and she doesn't want me there.

Is there anything I can do here?  Or do I just have to accept that some of my family sucks and move on?

&#x200B;

I decided to give an update, since we've finally reached the end of the mess from the first post. I told my husband, shortly after I posted the story here because I was feeling very anxious and he was going to pick up on that anyway. I don't think I have to say that my husband was livid, I never saw him like that before. After a lot of talking, I ended up learning a lot about the relationship between him and BIL.

&#x200B;

To keep things short, BIL is a huge asshole who has ruined relationships for my husband in the past. The only reason he didn't ruin ours was because my husband put a lot of distance between himself and his own family. His family by the way, always chalked it all up to sibling rivalry and never did anything to help, so I don't blame him.

&#x200B;

**What happened after:** My husband called BIL and asked him to not contact us anymore, he only wanted him to apologize to me for dragging me into this. BIL denied his request saying it was just a joke and I should be able to take one like a grown up. He hung up on us and that was that for a few days, until we received a call from my MIL who was very angry. BIL had told her and my FIL what had happened and that he was very upset that he couldn't even make jokes without my husband making a big deal out of it. So MIL was calling to say that we and my BIL's family weren't going to be invited to family gatherings anymore until everything was solved.

&#x200B;

I told my husband about the call and he was surprisingly calm this time around, saying that it was the usual behavior and that if I wanted to he would make an effort but he didn't care very much. At this point I was angry myself because I never saw this behavior in his family before and it was etremely frustrating. I told him not to bother and that it would be up to him to decide. We kept mostly to ourselves since and nobody reached out to us either. Until monday, when my FIL called us to say that BIL was invited to spend christmas with the family because his wife was pregnant. He only wanted to make sure that we knew this because he didn't want us showing up to ""ruin everyone's good time"".

&#x200B;

Me and my husband ended up laughing about it later because it was so absurd. But I noticed that it has taken a toll on my husband's mood and I'm debating suggesting therapy for him because I feel like there's a lot he doesn't feel comfortable telling me. We're going to spend christmas with my parents and I hope my husband will be able to tune out from this entire situation and have a good time.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR BIL said it was a joke but he was offended that we didn't take it as such. Shared with the family what had happened and eveyone ended up getting banned from family gatherings. Except now BIL can go home for christmas because his wife is pregnant. We cannot because we would ruin the party.**

A lot of people have  also been telling their own stories and I can't answer them all but know that I read it and your advices are being heard. This has helped me to get some perspective as I cannot share what happened with my close friends.

tl;dr of first post: Want to tell my close friends of 6 months that I lost my husband, daughter and a pregnancy 3 years ago and have lied to them about it by omission since we met.


So I really want to first take a moment to talk about how awesome my experience in this sub has been. I knew that I wanted to tell my friends the story of my past, and I knew they would react pretty well, and I knew they'd be supportive and we'd remain close friends. I really just didn't know how to bring it up after SIX months. I don't know if I expressed it in my first post, but 6 months is kind of a long time, I feel so close to these people in so many ways, so mostly it was just weird to me to not be able to casually mention my family. I absolutely still have days where it's hard to get out of bed and I just want to be left alone to cry in the dark, but so many times I think of happy memories with my family, and adorable things Veronica did that I'm reminded of and I want to be able to pepper those into my conversations. I struggled with HOW to tell people. One on one? Big group dinner? Email? So I actually emailed them all the day after my first post here and invited them over for dinner the next night if they could make it on short notice. I said to please bring their SOs, but told Kelly I'd explain later why I think she shouldn't bring her kids this time. Honestly I was just afraid she'd get really upset and wouldn't want her kids to see her like that. She couldn't get a sitter, so her husband stayed home with the kids, but Brenda and Luke brought their SOs, and I made a huge pot of chili and some cornbread. I feel like they sensed something was up, because honestly I thought the odds of them all being able to come with one day's notice was unusual. 

They showed up early evening, we sat in my living room (tight quarters!) and had some wine, and then I started. I'm an awkward person, so I basically said ""I have some big information about my past that I really want to share with you. It's not something that I share with everyone I meet and it's hard to bring up, but now so much time has gone by and I feel so close to you all, and I really want you to know this part of my life. I think it'll be emotional for you all to hear about, and I think it'll slightly change our dynamic for a while, but I'm also really excited to share this with you."" A couple of the girls were already teary. I didn't know if they'd googled me and already knew what I was going to say, or if they could just sense the emotion in my voice. I wanted the next part to be really blunt and not beat around the bush and first set it up so they wouldn't see where I was going. I said, 3 years ago my husband, 2 year old daughter and I were in a car accident when I was 5 months pregnant. My husband and daughter were killed instantly, and I lost the son I was carrying, but was otherwise physically okay.

Everyone was silently sobbing at this point, including me. I told them why I moved away, why I wanted to start fresh, and why now I needed them to know my story. Kelly got up and came over and sat on the floor by my feet and cried into my lap for a while. I stroked her hair and told her it was okay, and that her kids are the first kids I had contact with since Veronica and it genuinely gave me so much joy to be around them, and that the only thing I would change is that I'd like to share stories about our kids, talk about what Veronica liked to play with or the ""words"" she would say, diaper rash. We were all still crying, but there was a lot of smiling and joking too. I tried to break the ice a little bit with Kelly and said ""you know what this means right? I have had a baby and still look hot in a bikini!"" We giggled, she said OMG I can't believe I said that, I said I take it as a compliment and assured them all I would not hold anything against them they said previously that in the light of this new information could now be seen as offensive. 

It wrapped up so neatly like a goddamn sit com! I mean, they are good people and I knew it would. With all I've been through I'm choosey about who I let into my life and I could tell they were good people who would react well, but they've also all been friends for SO long, it always kind of feels like I'm the new kid and we aren't on equal footing. I am glad I told them all together though, instead of telling them individually. I honestly don't think I could have handled that emotionally, going through it took a lot out of me. 

Brenda actually said that when we first met and she was looking up to see if I had Facebook, she came across a headline about my accident but didn't click on it because the headline was so horrific and she assumed it was just someone with the same name. We finally ate chili around 10:30. I do think they'll tread lightly around me for a while, but I also think this is going to bring us closer. And I don't intend to bring my family up often, but I'm glad now I can share stories about my wedding planning, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I never wanted someone that I could cry to about missing my family. Honestly....that's mine and mine alone. I still go to therapy, so I'm not keeping it inside, but it just doesn't work for me to express my grief over my loss to others. Thanks for helping me talk this out Reddit.

So after reading all the responses here, I became increasingly more concerned. A background piece not included in my original post is that all the players in this scenario are connected by a recovery community. Because of this connection, I knew the ""ex"", Ashley, some years ago and we were still on one another's social media. I decided to reach out and ask about James.

That evening Ashley called me and we then conferenced in James. As it turns out, he is married to another woman and they have a child. He and Ashley never dated and aren't even really friends, they simply used to chat at a large meeting that was also attended by my friend, Wendy. They believe that she saw them speaking there and created a delusion that they had dated and Ashley was now poisoning James against Wendy, all the while he was married to another woman.?

Over the course of the last two years, Wendy has approached James at multiple meetings with declarations of love. He reiterated to her each time that he was married and stopped attending that meeting to avoid her. But oddly, she ended up at his meetings again and again. She approached his sponsor and friends telling them they were in love. She also approached Ashley threatening her with a restraining order because she believed Ashley was conspiring against James and her, as a couple, because they were ""together"" now. The second time she approached her, six months ago, Ashley called the police and made a report.?

Until our conference call, Ashley and James didn't realize how they were connected and they didn't know the extent of the delusions. When I told them about the marriage date, they were very concerned. James called the police.

I called the emergency mental health line looking for help, but their only suggestion was to call the police and ask for a welfare check on Wendy, which I did. Knowing that she has no connection to James and is living in a complete delusion made me so concerned for her. Once the wedding date came and she didn't get married, what would happen? How would she mentally process that??

I was given a reference number and when I called back, was told they made contact but did not intake her since she didn't appear dangerous. Since the check, she has ignored my calls. The wedding date came and passed and I heard nothing. At this time I feel like I lost a friend, but she was already gone in these delusions and I did what I could to help.?

Going forward, I hope to get updates from other people in the community that she is doing better, and hopefully abandons these delusions.

TL;DR: There was no wedding or relationship, James is a real person with no connection to Wendy, she was fully delusional.?",1534005097.0,[UPDATE] My [28/F] friend [41/F] announced she is getting married next week. I have reason to believe she is lying.,0.98

Two years after posting this, I can safely say that my family is irreparably fractured. My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore.

&#x200B;

When I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why ""she is like this"".

&#x200B;

I'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. ""Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?"" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see ""both sides"" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me.

&#x200B;

I even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger.

&#x200B;

It got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that.

&#x200B;

I'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years.

&#x200B;

And last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it.

&#x200B;

The past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me.

Or, in many cases, they are just outright using posts and their comments as case studies to drive their articles or discussion.  We have observed this behavior sporadically in the past, but now we are starting to see it happening with greater frequency and consistency, so we need to let you all know.

To be clear, we don't condone this kind of behavior in any way.  We are not interested in the additional traffic this behavior might bring.  We are not interested in the kind of extra guidance that users might receive from the larger audience these outlets possess.

That's really the key here.  We get the reality.  We're taking it to the reddit admins to figure out the legal perspective because it is murky territory that isn't likely to be in our favor.  However, all the same, we moderators are still reaching out to these entities from the ethical perspective as best we can.  While our subreddit does indeed represent a public forum, you are still a relatively vulnerable individual who worked up the courage to put yourself and your situation out to this community.

Anyway, to the update. I went to see my boss and another boss, one of which I wasn?t sure how she felt about me so figured it would be a good idea to ask someone I?m close to and someone I?m not to cover all the bases. It turns out it actually is just the two I?m aware of that don?t like me. However, it was also pointed out that while people do love my sense of humour, I need to be more aware around people who don?t know me because I do come across as condescending or rude.



I?ve gotten lots of great tips from you all, and from my bosses as to what to work on and how to be more appropriate at work. I?m going back to therapy this week as well. It was suggested by some Redditors that I don?t seem happy and maybe that was an issue. Turns out I?m still holding a lot of pain and defensiveness from a past abusive relationship so I?m working on that too.



It?s a long road ahead but I?m going to work hard to make it to where I can let go, be happy and learn how to better understand others and be more appropriate. I really appreciate the replies from everyone, so thanks again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yn3jg/my_28m_husband_31m_of_6_years_takes_ridiculous/

So that post totally blew up. I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them. 

One post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him. 

It also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area ""village."" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective. 

The yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to ""call someone goddamnit."" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because ""that's a $6500 grill on that car!"" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out. 

Yesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a ""burden"" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson. 

While we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on ""kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to ""one upping"" and ""talking down"" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good. 

So basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it. 

If I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!

A few things to address before I go into the actual update:

I did not confront Jenna when she was going on her tirade because they were in Troy's bedroom. I have no reason to barge into someone else's bedroom to start a fight. You can stop with the pitchforks about how I was awful for not immediately wrestling Jenna to the floor in a show of manliness. Waiting for the event to pass was a much better way to handle this. 

Hannah does not need you to tell her that she's wearing the wrong sized bra. She has been to ABraThatFits for fit checks, and she measures herself frequently and knows what works on her body. She has a wide range of sizes from when she was figuring out her fit size. If the measurements really don't make sense to you, I can't help you. All I can say is that she's a fat bottom girl.

To the actual update: 

I talked to Troy about Jenna's outburst. He said that he would handle it, and he was extremely apologetic and said that it would not happen again. He said he was glad Hannah didn't hear Jenna's tirade, and I agreed that it was for the best if we tried to handle this maturely. Hannah was still hurt from Jenna's comments on FB, but Troy asked Jenna to apologize, and that's what happened. We let Troy know that Jenna wouldn't be allowed over again if she continued to behave like that. He agreed and said he would be reconsidering their relationship.

Some time passed, and here we are. Hannah has gone back to just being comfortable in her own home, taking her bra off when she gets home. She is respectful of Jenna and Troy's space and wears a bra if Jenna is over. But things changed the other night. 

Hannah and I were cooking dinner when Jenna came over to wait for Troy. She hung out in the kitchen and talked to Hannah (they seemed to get along a little better at least, Hannah is very sweet and doesn't hold many grudges). I was chopping up brussels sprouts to roast while Hannah was making some herb and parm crusted chicken or something and some cucumber tomato salad that I love. She coated some huge chicken breasts that she'd pounded and that's when Jenna piped up and said something like, 'Wow, that's so much food. You're not going to eat all that, are you?' to Hannah. 

Hannah laughed and said yeah, she was going to eat it all. It was her dinner. Jenna scoffed and made some comment like, ""That's so much food, I could NEVER eat that much. But well, look at me."" She got up to try and get our attention and show off her figure. Hannah didn't say anything, but I could tell by the look on her face that she was starting to panic. Hannah has a long history with ED NOS and one of her only triggers is people paying attention to what she eats like that. She used to not be able to eat at restaurants because she was afraid of people judging her. 

Jenna took it a step further and said something about how she goes to the gym every day because she loves keeping her figure and she knows Troy loves it. She pointedly asked Hannah when the last time she went to the gym was and then asked me if I thought Hannah should do some kind of Yoga or something. She made some comment about how sad it is when girls ""let themselves go"" after they get boyfriends. (For the record, Hannah didn't). I was starting to get very angry because it sounded like she was implying I do not love Hannah's figure or something. I put my hand on Hannah's shoulder and told her to go to our bedroom, I could finish up. She had the fakest smile and said goodnight to Jenna.

I let Jenna have it. I dont' want to go into what I said because it was not my best moment, but I could not accept her trying to intimidate or make Hannah feel bad. I especially could not take her implying at all that I wasn't attracted to Hannah. It all felt too surreal. I've never met someone who would just say mean things about a girl who was perfectly nice to her like that. Especially not about her weight. 

Jenna left and told me she was going to ""have a talk with Troy."" I consoled Hannah, who said she was okay, but ended up not eating dinner. We watched some TV together and about two hours later, Troy comes in. He just stands in the doorway and looks at us and he looks right at Hannah and says ""I broke up with her. I'm so sorry. She is never coming back.""

Jenna is gone and done. Troy later said that Jenna was convinced Hannah was trying to steal him and that she was just jealous of her body. It was all because of one day when Jenna came over and Hannah gushed over the dress she was wearing. Jenna thought that meant she was in love with her or something. I have no idea where this came from. 

It was never about the bra I guess.

So I sat my boyfriend down and told him I really don't like how he disrespects my sexual boundaries especially when he knows how hard it is for me to say no to anybody, and it took a lot to directly tell him to stop and keep my foot down. He flipped. He said that I was being selfish and inconsiderate by not letting him do anal. I kept thinking of all the kind words everyone left on the original post and didn't budge. This just made him angrier. He said there are plenty of prettier, sexier, and all around better girls that would be more than willing to give him what he wants. In fact, he had plans to meet up with a girl the next day. Admittedly, that stung, but I knew I couldn't give in. The responses to the previous post really opened my eyes. 

So he stormed out in a fit of rage after I didn't give him what he wanted and I started gathering all his shit and putting it into garbage bags. I was running purely on fury at that point. I left his shit outside the door and locked it. I then sent him a text that only read ""In case there was any question, we're done.""

I was whisked back and after ~20 minutes I was diagnosed with kidney stones. Fentanyl and gravol and I had a CT scan and then went for a procedure to bust the kidney stones. (Anyone questioning whether or not to have the procedure: DO IT. The side effects are nothing). 

5 hours later and I was laying on my parent's sofa in a haze. I have never, and hope to never, feel pain like that again in my life. I was sure I was going to die. The attending in the ER told me it's worse than child birth and that they've had it before, too. 

I didn't text my GF throughout because I really didn't have the strength or foresight. I was drugged up and uncomfortable. My sister found out that I had been in the emergency room and soon after my GF called me. She was pissed off I didn't call her. Then I reminded her that I begged her not to leave as I thought something was wrong. She got quiet and eked out an apology. I got furious and said something rather nasty things.. among them ""f-off"" and some other unsavory things. 

In fairness, I was on dope, still sore, peeing blood and felt like someone had punched me in the gut. Standing was incredibly painful. I needed to take two days off of work & school, I rested in bed and the only thing you can think is ""the person who should have been there didn't even believe me."" 

She's texted me this week a formal apology and wants one in return for saying nasty things to her. I've been avoiding her texts/calls. I've felt like shit this week and picked something up in the ER so I laid low, took a few days off work and relaxed. She wants to meet tonight and talk about everything, but I'm still so mad I don't know if I should hold off seeing her. 

Is this as big a transgression as I feel like it is? Am I blowing this out of proportion because I felt so shitty? 

I just am so annoyed and angry. 

tl;dr GF didn't believe me something was wrong and I wound up in the ER with kidney stones and needed a procedure.

My apologies in advance, this got much longer than I anticipated.

Hello reddit,

I debated for a while on whether or not I should post an update. On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her.

Soon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy.

We made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography.

Then came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film.

We were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it.

Anyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going.

You guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies. 

I hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet. 

Thanks again reddit.

So, let me clear something up right away.

>where did she get your DNA from huh huh HUH!

She, got it from me when I was asleep I'm a heavy sleeper so that's how she did it.

>she could have slept with someone else and got pregnant and used THE REAL FATHERS DNA!!!

That would've been hard for her to sleep with someone else because during the time our daughter was conceived we were staying in a hotel.

**On with the update**

So, after reading the comments (which were just telling me how much of a keeper she is) I didn't open it. I went to look for her and just gave it back which surprised her.

She asked me why didn't I open it and I told her I trust her (because I do) and I didn't need a silly DNA test. We hugged and kissed and she just threw it in the kitchen drawer and that's where it shall remain.

After I made her favorite dinner (Parmesan chicken with a salad and garlic bread) and sorta had a date. Honestly, she's treated me better than any girlfriend ever did and I'm glad I met her when I did.

After we talked and I don't know what she was doing but it made me realize I really need to marry her. 

So I looked through the drawers and found a plastic ring (don't know where it came from just know that's why me and her call it the shit drawer)and went back to her.

And I proposed I thought for sure she'd get pissed that it wasn't a real ring but she didn't. She cried and said yes and actually put it on Lol but I do plan on getting her a real nice one.

So, I'm engaged now don't know if it still counts considering I didn't have a real ring.

It's been a few months since I posted about being exhausted by my husband's lack of ability (will?) to makeup after arguments and/or saying cruel and hurtful things. Despite a brief period of ""improvement"" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies.

I joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic.

In the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said ""fine"". So we're done. I moved into the guest room

A few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\*\*t isn't my problem anymore.

I'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore.

TL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said ""fine"". We're over, and I just feel relieved.

PS: Bought a lock for my bedroom door as well

Small edit: I realized that I failed to mention a few things on why I'm staying in the house: We do have a daughter (9), and kids make things a little trickier. I am in an intense nursing program and only work (very) part time as a tutor. He works nights so our interactions are limited to the two days he has off. I leave before he gets home and when I'm getting home from school, he's out the door. I know it would be best to find a place to stay but the resources in this area are extremely limited. My college is literally in a cornfield.

I also want to thank you all for the support, I have felt so lonely for months and to have strangers be so kind means a lot to me. I'm definitely going to download  that book, "" Why Does He Do That?"", and make the time to read it. 

We were married for 10 years and one commenter did the easy math....Yeah I was 18 when we married, 17 when we met. I was fresh out of a physically abusive relationship, and he was so nice to me.

I want to say thank you to everyone for all the wonderful advice. I had a lot to think about and consider.

Two days before Thanksgiving I decided to ask my mom if she knew what was going on with my sister. She told me that she just found out from the kids that my sister and her husband took off to another state for a last-minute vacation, without the kids. She didn?t tell anyone and left her kids pretty much alone. My parents live nearby and would have been happy to have them over. Apparently, my sister?s mother in law lives on the property in an RV with no electricity. Mother in law has schizophrenia and does not take her meds. I didn?t mention in my original post, but the kids are 16M and 15F, the older kid does not have a driver?s license. They also live out in the woods, a good distance from the closest town. At this point, I had decided not to invite her over. 

The day before Thanksgiving, my dad called and told me that he believed my sister was under the impression that she was coming to my house with her family, even though I haven?t spoken to her. I told him that her husband was not welcome, and he said I needed to tell her because he didn?t want to stir up trouble. I didn?t want to call her because she was alone in another state with her husband and I didn?t want that to start a fight. My dad took it upon himself to call her and ask her directly what her plans were for Thanksgiving. She said she was coming to my house and he told her to call me first because there are issues. She never called me and told my mom later that night that she wasn?t coming home until after Thanksgiving. My mom invited both kids to my house for Thanksgiving.

My nephew decided to go to his cousins (on his dad?s side), where there is absolutely no supervision. My sister and husband are apparently okay with this. Thankfully, my mom was able to get my niece to come with them to my house. I took the opportunity to spend some time alone with her. She opened up about her problems at home and asked for a lot of advice about college, jobs, etc. I told her she is always welcome in my home and invited her to spend some time with us on her Christmas break. I gave her my number and told her to text me anytime, especially if she needs a break from her home. I don?t know if she will take me up on my offer, but it?s there. 

I?m pretty disappointed that my sister would leave her kids on Thanksgiving. Her daughter was hurt by this, but now she knows there is someone that will support her and be there if she needs it. All in all, we had an awesome, drama free Thanksgiving.  

TL;DR: Did not invite my sister to Thanksgiving because of her abusive husband, but was able to give my niece a lifeline which might make all the difference. ",1542990687.0,[UPDATE]I (37F) feel bad not inviting my sister (39F) to Thanksgiving because I don't want to be around her husband (38M),0.97
92,uneasypeasy,Breakups,bio854,4342,"My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we?ve never had a lack of affection, but that she?s unhappy and she?s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left. 

We?ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren?t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn?t meet somebody else. We?ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She?s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me. 

All I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I?ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she?s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I?m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   

She?s not only pushing me out but she?s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I?ve been able to gather from mutual friends she?s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she?s at it because she?s micromanaging everyone. 

Since she left I?ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won?t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it?ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can?t convince her that there doesn?t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren?t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can?t see any of it and I?m afraid she?s completely ignoring what she?s doing by working so much she can?t think about anything else. 

I hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife?s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she?s not acting like herself but they can?t say anything to her or she?ll push them out too. It?s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.

I keep telling myself it?s going to be ok, she?s going to realize she doesn?t have to do this, but it?s been 20 days and I?m starting to lose hope. I don?t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can?t do on my own, but I can?t leave because I?m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of ?us? and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. 

Tl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me.

Edit -
I think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.

I've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this.

The problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too.

I also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them.

Also -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard.

My first post blew up in a way I didn't expect it to, but I wanted to thank you all for your advice. You gave me a lot to think about so when it came time to talk to Cindy, I wouldn't trip over my words or anything.

I took her out to lunch yesterday (Sunday), and just very matter-of-factly told her how I was tired of her disparaging my bf, how I was tired of her putting down nursing as a profession and dismissing it just as ""women's work"", and finally told her that despite her insistence that she was just joking, I found her ""jokes"" offensive and was done with hearing them. I made it very clear that my boyfriend hadn't sent me to defend him but that I was the one who was offended and tired of it.

She started to cry a little (which was alarming) and broke down and told me why she was doing what she was doing. Apparently, long story short, in her first marriage, Cindy's income was more than double of that of her husband. After a year or so of marriage, he quit his job and ended up just mooching off of her. He became incredibly emotionally abusive and ruined her financially until she was able to get out and leave him. Basically--she was nervous that the same would happen to me, and she hoped that her ""jokes"" would sway my opinion enough to leave my bf. 

I was kind of ??????? about her explanation, but she told me that she knew the jokes were childish and offensive, but she didn't know how else to go about it. She said that I was the closest thing to a daughter she had, and that she loves me very much and that she felt awful about everything.

I started getting teary at this, and I told her that the jokes especially hurt from her because she's someone I care deeply for, and she apologized profusely for having offended/hurting me. She said she really thought my boyfriend was a nice guy and that she wanted to get to know him better, which thrilled me. 

I went home, told my boyfriend (who didn't know why I was gone, I wanted to be covert about it), and he was thrilled. He told me that secretly he WAS upset about the jokes, as he knew that Cindy was someone I cared a lot for, but put on a game face because he didn't want to drive a wedge in between us. He told me he loved me, and thanked me for standing up for him, and said he's looking forward to getting to know Cindy better too! And my dad is over the moon as well :)

Thank you for your advice, all! <3 Communication really is key.

The wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.

The wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.

The reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no.

He also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.

He called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous.

Coincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.

My husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives.

I got so many kind words of encouragement on my previous post that I figured a follow-up post would be appropriate.

As the edit in my original post read, I followed through. I got to the grave site before the funeral procession so that I could go over the event proceedings with the conducting officials. They were very nice and understanding of me wanting to play. They told me what my cue would be to begin playing, I took my place about 10 feet behind the grave (everyone would be gathered in front of the grave), and waited for the procession to arrive.

I was very nervous, but I knew that I wanted to follow through with this no matter how it went. Once everyone was there and the casket was set in place, a pastor stood before the crowd and offered some final words while the two air force representatives stood on either side of the casket. After the pastor was done speaking, the representatives saluted and I knew it was time to begin.

I took a deep breath, brought my horn up to my lips, closed my eyes and began to play, starting on a D, as some people suggested (it is a lower note, and is easier to play, and no one knows the difference).

Well reddit, it was perfect. I couldn't be more happy that I was able to honor my grandfather as he asked me to before his passing.

So pretty much all of the advice in the original thread was useful, but some of the best advice came from users like /u/frehsprints (who pointed out that I was probably misunderstanding what my boss meant by ""reimbursement"") and /u/mawkish, who stressed going through every available channel with the software company to get a refund and making my boss explicitly request money.


Anyways, on to the actual update. After I emailed the software company and they refused to refund it, I emailed my boss letting him know that, and that's when he dropped the reimbursement line. I still don't know exactly what type of reimbursement he was looking for, but I'm fairly certain now that what he meant was that he'd have to get it from the budget of the small team I work in and he runs, which would be a waste of money.

Not sure anyone would care for an update, but I figured I'd make one anyways.

After my post, things kept going as they were. He kept making my depression about him, not really listening to me or empathizing with my feelings. I just got a little too overwhelmed by him. He started to blame me for my feelings ""affecting"" him so negatively. He was upset that my depression was making *him* bummed out. I started going in to a downward spiral of depression. 

The long story short is that we broke up about a month ago. It started off as a ""break"" so I could just deal with it on my own without ""affecting"" him, but now it is permanent. 

Anyways... About two days after the break started, I immediately started noticing I wasn't feeling as depressed anymore. I know the depression will always come back in swings, but at least I don't have to deal with him digging in the way he was. He's upset that we won't be getting back together but I feel infinitely less stressed.

TL;DR: Boyfriend was digging in and making my depression about him. We split up and now I am no longer in a downward spiral. ",1550438205.0,(UPDATE) My [23F] boyfriend [29M] keeps making my depression about him and it only makes me feel more hopeless.,0.97

I knew she had a history of traumatic relationships and had hence decided not to date, but I also knew she had a pretty intense crush on a friend of a friend I had never met, James.

When I moved to another state, we stayed in touch via phone calls. She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together. Because these conversations became so odd, I stopped the calls and stepped away from the friendship. 

This week, I visited my former city on an impromptu trip and met up with Wendy. She told me the exciting news that her and James were finally getting married after this ex had kept them apart so long. She showed me photos of a home he bought her, of horses he bought her, and of her in a wedding dress. She told me the name of the venue and invited me. Then she dropped the bombshell that James is apparently a millionaire. 

All of this seemed off to me and when I got home, my concerns mounted. Her house was not packed despite the fact she is supposedly moving imminently. Money seems tight for her, she is living in relative squalor, if she has a millionaire fiance, why isn't he helping her? 

I did some digging. I found the house she showed me on Zillow, still for sale. I found the horses on a website for a local ranch that does tours. I called the venue and they told me they are unbooked on the supposed wedding date. All the available evidence tells me that she is not getting married. My gut tells me that her and James are not even in a relationship or have any contact. 

I don't know what to do next. Do I confront her? Do I warn James? Are these simply lies or are they delusions and the symptom of a serious mental illness? How do I help her?

I took a week to think about the post and my own feelings. I talked it out in therapy and I came to the conclusion that I could not keep working 70 hours a week. It was destroying my relationship with my wife and son and it was also destroying my happiness. I spoke to my boss and he was very understanding and told me that there was enough in the budget to hire an assistant for me. My assistant started two weeks ago and my work load has been dramatically reduced. I have been able to work a normal 40 hour work week and I am now finally coming home before 6:00 PM each weekday!

I spoke with my best friend about my wife and he knocked some sense into me. He told me how jealous he and the rest of our friends were over my wife and how lucky I was to be with a woman who is super-model attractive, yet driven and kind and compassionate like my wife. Later that night, I drank a bottle of scotch and got sloppy drunk. My wife found me puking in the bathroom and in my drunken haze I confessed to her everything I was holding back. I told her about how I felt left out because I wasn't around for our son, how I didn't feel connected to her like I wanted to be, the whole nine yards. She held me and let me cry it out and she told me that she loved me.

The wife and I are headed to couple's counseling, but we also signed up for cooking classes to build a common hobby. She says that she will stay by me as long as I stay be her, no matter what happens. I love her and she loves me and I think we are going to be okay.

So besides reassuring her verbally continuously, making sure we do a lot of things together and being a good brother, I needed to get her into therapy and I found the right therapist for her. She's a psychologist who specializes in children's issues after divorce.

The only problem was money. I called both my parents and told them that I need to talk to them (separately) and told them that we need more money as she needs to get therapy and I want to do nice things for her and that's the least they owe us after everything. They were hesitant but eventually agreed. I'm now getting $500 more each month from my mother and $750 more from father and that is a real help. When we have extra money from what my parents give us I put it in a college fund for her and this extra money means that not only she can see a great therapist but now I can save more for her.

I also talked to a lawyer as a lot of you suggested to make sure we're getting the right amount of money and it seems that we do. Of course we could go on and get them to court and make everything happen through the legal system but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her. She's much safer and better off here than in their hands. Obviously the option is on the table if they decide to stop paying or reduce the amount.

And a couple of you suggested we do something symbolic which I liked a lot. So I bought two matching necklaces and had them engrave our names on them and told my sister that we're doing to wear these to remind ourselves that each of us will always be there for the other and we can count on each other.

We've already been to two sessions of therapy and I think things are good. The necklace has worked and she doesn't even want to take it off when she takes a shower.

I don't even know how many private messages I've gotten since the lock and how many people have gone through this or had relatives to through this.


Things will be static for a while but when there is news I will post an update. Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world.

Thank you again.


I hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here. 

Mark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all. 

Marriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count. 

Then about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself. 

He moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this ""man"" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover. 

Mark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further. 

It happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for ""living true to himself"" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost ""shamed"" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor. 

Is it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was. 


   
**tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our ""community"" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision. 

Edit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that!

1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives. 

2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest.

My post didn't get very much attention, but I thought I'd post an update anyway because I like them so much.  I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out.

I did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet.

We ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.  

It's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.

I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. 

I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.

The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.

So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? 

I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason.

I go to the same cafe every day and the owners have taken on almost a parental role since my family is so far away. I'm close with them and I trust them and they care about my wellbeing, so when one of the owners, Sara, gave me the number of another regular, Derek, I trusted her judgment.

I know Derek a little bit from spending time in the cafe. It's a small place and we both sit at the counter so we can chat with the owners. Usually, we sit next to each other. We've chatted about movies, he once helped me with my language homework, and he's generally in the cafe hanging out most afternoons. Sometimes reading, sometimes working on his computer. He's also friends with the owners of the cafe and has always seemed like a nice person so I certainly wasn't against getting to know him better.

When Sara gave me his number yesterday, she was selling him pretty hard. I asked her about the book she was reading and she said, ""Derek lent it to me!"" and when I asked about a card game she said, ""Derek taught it to me!"". So I said, ""okay, I get it. I'll text him.""

I texted Derek after I left the cafe and I thought it was maybe a bad idea because if things went south, it would be uncomfortable to see him in the cafe almost every day. But it seemed like Derek had already set things in motion by asking Sara to slip me his phone number in the first place.

Derek told me that he could use more friends in the neighborhood and that he'd like to get to know me outside of the cafe, so we went out for a few beers. So, last night I learned that Derek is 31, unemployed, and he sees dead people. He's a full-on weirdo, which is fine. I still had fun hanging out with him and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened until I got home.

In the 10 minutes it took for me to get into my apartment and get ready for bed, Derek sent me about 20 messages about how he wanted to kiss me and asking if he could come upstairs. I told him ""no, thank you for a fun evening. good night."" and went to bed. My phone died overnight and when I woke up and plugged it in, he had sent me more messages confronting me about blocking his number, which I didn't do. These messages were over the top and intense and honestly, they worry me a bit.

It's obvious to me that I need to back away from this person, but right now I have no idea how to do that gracefully. I wouldn't mind a friendship, but he's made it clear that he's interested in a romantic relationship. I just want to be able to get coffee and enjoy myself without any awkwardness.

What can I do? What should I say to Derek? And should I tell Sara that this guy freaked me out?

TL;DR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?

Update: Thank you for your advice! I just went to have some coffee and talk with Sara. I didn't tell her everything but I told her I found Derek a little strange and she asked me what happened and I told her what he said about seeing ghosts.

I mentioned in one of my comments that Sara shares some of Derek's interests in spirituality and mindfulness. We talked a little more about this. she's a very open-minded person. Sara knows that Derek believes he sees and hears ghosts and said she wasn't sure if it was true but she didn't believe he was deranged. I probably misunderstood some of what he was telling me about seeing dead people because we weren't speaking English.

She asked me overall how I felt the date went and I told her that he was getting pretty intense, he's too old for me, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. She told me that she thinks Derek is a good boy but agreed that he can be a little over the top and told me to let her know if he did anything else that made me uncomfortable.",1541765708.0,How do I [23 F] back away from this guy [31 M] without losing my favorite coffee shop?,0.98

So I read all the responses- couldn't respond to all of them sorry but I did jump into action.

Thank you for all your kind thoughts and responses.

A lot of people were saying to cook him a meal and then ask him so that's what I did.

It was a bit of a disaster, I screwed up the chicken dish I wanted to make, ended up making mac'n'cheese with this expensive gluten free saffron pasta because Alan is King of the Kitchen and even our olive oil is fancy.

He was sympathetic but I could tell he was amused when I told him I screwed up the dish and was happy with mac'n'cheese.

Anyway, I was already a bit agitated from screwing up dinner but when we sat down, I was thinking about /u/tabithatortie 's comments about how Alan was my lobster.

Only I was so nervous I said ""Alan, you're a lobster"" instead of saying that he was my lobster and that just confused him and asked me if I wanted him to make lobster.

That just made me embarrassed so I told him not to worry about it and went to pour him some wine and ended up knocking his glass into the mac'n'cheese and ruining it. 

So we ended up getting takeaway and watching Netflix and I was still a bit on edge because I'd screwed up the evening- we were cuddling so he could tell that I was a bit tense and not focused I guess.

Anyway, he asked me what the matter was and I just blurted out ""Are you my boyfriend?"", he looked uncertain and said ""Yes, if you want me to be"" and I just very emphatically said I wanted him to be and he looked very relieved and happy.

I apologized for evading the topic before and Alan said it was OK because I was the best boyfriend he'd ever had with or without labels and that got us to the fun portion of the night.

Anyway, a bit later I guess something twigged because he asked me if that was what dinner was about and said yes and he pinched my cheeks and called me adorable. Then he asked me what the lobster thing was- he thought I'd tried to make him lobster but I explained the Friends quote and he said it was a good thing I was pretty. 

Anyway, I asked him if we need to make an announcement or anything but we agreed that we wouldn't say anything unless people brought it up or we need to introduce each other. Alan also said, he liked the term partner better than boyfriend and I agreed, it does sound more serious but I guess that's what this is.

I wrote a letter to Sarah. I told her I was sorry for not being empathetic to what she was going through. I told her I didn?t understand how much the proposal meant to her. I apologized if what I said misled her into thinking it was okay for her to propose to me.

I listed my timeline. I said I'd like to be engaged around the time I graduated university and I wanted to get married the same year. I mentioned I was open to having children with her.

I gave Sarah the letter when she came home from work. She read it and we had a discussion about everything over dinner.  

My girlfriend apologized for mistaking my words as a green light for her to propose. She expressed regret for withdrawing physical intimacy and distancing herself from me for 3 weeks. 

Sarah explained to me how she never wanted kids or marriage at the beginning of our relationship, but seeing all her friends get married made her question that. My girlfriend realized she wasn't content anymore on staying child free and not getting married for the rest of her life. 

My girlfriend told me my timeline was acceptable for her. Sarah asked if I could be the one to propose to her this time - I told her I would. I?ve never seen my girlfriend so giddy with excitement before.

I?m glad we could come to a happy solution. I?m excited to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I love her with all my heart and I couldn?t see myself being with a different person. I know I?m young to get married, but I?m absolutely ecstatic to start a family with my girlfriend. 

Our relationship is back to normal, we have sex everyday and she?s comfortable initiating with me again. She doesn?t cry in secret anymore and we?re back to our regular levels of physical intimacy. 

I deeply regret rejecting her proposal because in reality this is what I wanted the whole time. I just needed a few days to seriously think about it. I'm glad my girlfriend has forgiven me for this. I know both of us are equally at fault because of our lack of communication but it really did suck having to reject her.

**tl;dr:** I wrote a letter to my girlfriend explaining to her when I?d like to get married and that I was open to having children with her. Her and I apologized to each other for not communicating clearly enough. We agreed on my timeline and I?m going to propose to her next year when I graduate!

My partner birthday was a fortnight ago. She's brought up several times how cool it would be to dive with sharks, so this year for her birthday I stretched financially surprised her with two tickets to do a scuba dive at an aquarium where you can experience swimming with sharks and stingrays. She was pumped!

&#x200B;

The deal is you arrive on the day, and they teach you everything you need to know to scuba dive. After a 45 minute safety presentation, we put on the gear and got into the main aquarium tank on a metal ledge to practice our scuba diving skills (clearing regulator, clearing mask) before diving down to the bottom of the main aquarium tank.

After putting on the gear, I noticed my partner was anxious so I tried to comfort her by holding her hand and being close to her. When we get into the water, the instructors started letting us go underwater to learn how it feels to use the regulator to breathe and learn the basic skills.

&#x200B;

At this point I noticed my partner had been taken to the side by one of the other instructors, who looked like they were trying to calm her down. I kept looking over to try and see what was happening, but my instructor told me I needed to pay attention to what I was learning or I wouldn't be able to dive, so I did.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later, I then noticed my partner and the other instructor were swimming around by themselves and my heart sank. I knew at this point my partner had decided the experience was too uncomfortable for her and she was panicky and she did not want to proceed. The other instructor was trying to let my partner see some of the wildlife anyway before  she got out of the tank.

&#x200B;

At this point I had to decide whether to proceed without my partner or not. I felt terrible proceeding without her (because this was supposed to be for \_her\_ birthday!), but knew that it would make my partner feel even worse if I didn't do the experience because she would have felt like she 'fucked it up for the both of us'.

&#x200B;

I ended up doing the dive, and it was a sad experience without my partner. The whole time I could only really think about how this was wrong, and I couldn't fully enjoy the experience. The worst part was that by this time my partner had changed back into her clothes and was on the other side of the aquarium wall, and we were waving to each other and she was taking photos of me etc. I just felt pity for her :(

&#x200B;

After the experience I met up with her, she asked me to tell her all about it and how it was, I just said it was good then I tried to change the subject because I didn't want her to focus on what she missed out on. I told her let's go get some food and do whatever you want for the rest of the day.

&#x200B;

She kept apologising for how she was 'too chicken' and how she ruined everything and wasted my money, and that once she felt panicked she didn't feel comfortable being underwater. I told her that everything was okay, I just felt terrible because I got to do this experience and she didn't and that I was sorry and that I completely understood and there was no way to know how you will feel about things before you're actually doing them.

&#x200B;

Reddit I feel terrible about this. I love her so much and was trying to give her a once in a lifetime experience that would be magical for her and she could look back on fondly, but it just ended up with both of us feeling like crap apologising to one another. I don't even feel like looking at the pictures she took of me. How can I make this better?

111,AssholeCousin,Updates,4upxcr,4136,"So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update.

The TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings.

Anyways, on to the update.

I was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship.

Anyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.)

My fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said ""So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin.""

Emily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship.

She had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) ""went bridezilla"" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.)

She also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for ""her screwup.""

Guys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot.

Molly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to ""quit being such a whiner"" and enjoy my wedding.

So the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation.

The wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty.

The only thing she asked was if the ""Blame Emily"" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come.

She actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the ""adults"" and ""younger kids"" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.)

**TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends.

**Minor Update to the update-** 

So... it turns out ""Molly"" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: ""Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?""

So going forward, please replace ""Molly"" with ""Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains.""

Oh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW!

112,thisgirlisonawire,Infidelity,4z9cgn,4116,"Well, title kind of says it all. Throwaway because my husband is active on Reddit. He's probably on it now.

Here goes: I've been with my husband for 5 years, married for 1.5. I've never *once* doubted his fidelity. He's great. Super smart, funny, handsome, and, I **thought**, loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt him or be suspicious.

I thought it was kind of odd when he downloaded snapchat; he's not big on social media. I have one, but I'm not very active. We rarely snap each other. He said his friends were really active and he liked it better than Facebook, so. As I said, I've never had any reason not to trust him. So I thought nothing of it. 

This morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said ""Mom"". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named ""Roxy"". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said ""I want your tongue inside me again"".

Now. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are ""best friends"". **WTF**.

I feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.

Here's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.

He's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. 

**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby & me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She ""stalked"" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting).

113,Jayx8,Non-Romantic,4ou08h,4105,"What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery.

I never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise.

My sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him.

Apparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing.

My sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said ""she's not sure"".

I can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself.

I don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do.

So I realized that this couldn't go on and I had to do something. The comments in the thread made me realize why he was doing this, and so one time when we were driving to my house, I led the conversation to social awkwardness, which he has had some problems with. So we started talking about **his** social awkwardness in particular.

This is where I use the opportunity to say: ""Well you got this thing in social settings, though, which really shows that you are struggling in the circumstances""

He asks: ""What thing?""

And I reply: ""You joke a lot. Like with my girlfriend, she can't ask you anything, you just keep cracking constant jokes. It's almost a reflex for you. I think you may do it because you're not sure how to act""

He agreed and he said it's a problem, so we agreed to go to my house to see my girlfriend, with the goal in mind that he wouldn't joke so much.

In the start he was obviously under immense pressure, because we had just been talking about this and he must have been feeling as if I was judging his every move (and perhaps my gf too) so there was a bit of stuttering, where he must have been battling his insecurities deeply inside. But he won that battle because, you know what? He was great that evening. My girlfriend and he had a great conversation and after he left, she told me how great it was to talk to him when he acted normal.

It was really great to open the issue up, because now we can communicate about it freely and work on it.

I'd like to thank you all for your invaluable help. Without it, I would never have realized what to do!

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lumdd/i_26m_suffer_from_aspergers_and_thought_i_was/



After a lot of thinking I decided I wanted to give it a shot. I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more. 



We were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly. 

I was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the ""love you"" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings


Instead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  ""if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out"" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face. 



I suck so I ended up blurting out ""I think Im in love with you"". yeah I realized I F up and said ""no I mean like, like you"" 


She went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to ""which is it, like or love ?"". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah .... 


So I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of. 


But she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked. 


We've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled. 


I told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me. 



 So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.


 OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early.

116,AbleAlgae,Relationships,9aojry,4070,"My friend came to me yesterday at lunch with screenshots of my boyfriend's tinder profile. The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like ""Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that."" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile.

So, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, ""Look, I have nothing to hide."" and of course the app is deleted.

So I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts.

So that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over.

He is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time.

I know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.

TL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do?

Edit: This blew up while I was away!I'm sorry I won't be able to respond to every comment.

So I did some stuff that was kind of petty and stupid today: I made a fake tinder account, matched with my boyfriend, and he starts messaging me and immediately asks me to meet him for a drink. We agree to meet by a fountain in the center of my town and I pack up all of his stuff in a tote bag, put on a great outfit and went to the fountain.

I stood kind of out of the way of the fountain in the shadows where I could watch the street that I knew he'd be arriving from. I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder.

But he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did. We didn't speak (I don't know them well), but they watched me for a while, figured out what was going on after a few more tinder messages, and left quickly.

So I wait a few minutes and I call my boyfriend and ask him where he's at. He says he's just gotten off of work and he's going to meet his roommate for a drink. I confront him with the fake tinder profile and he's dumbstruck and furious with his roommate, who he swears up and down is behind all of this.

I'm at home now, just emotionally exhausted and confused. Whatever is going on with his roommates is super sketchy and creepy.

advice please?

Edit part two:

Thank you all so much for your advice and support!

A few things that I think are important

* Up until this point my boyfriend and I had a great relationship. Really, no red flags anywhere. If I had already been suspicious that he was cheating this would be a much easier break for me
* The most recent message on his tinder account when I checked it yesterday was sent to a girl he had matched with before we met. It said ""Would you want to meet up with my friend?""
* My boyfriend is the kind of person who's iphone passcode is 0000. I wouldn't be surprised if his roommates did know all of his passwords. 

&#x200B;

So, his tinder account is still matched with my fake profile. To me, that indicates that he probably isn't the person operating the tinder profile. If it were him, wouldn't he have blocked the fake profile immediately?

&#x200B;

A lot of people have said that he probably sent his roommates to check things out for him. I can't write that off entirely but my gut says that it isn't true. I just don't think it's very likely. 

&#x200B;

When it comes to his roommates, I'm very concerned that they have been using his profile to trick women into meeting with them.

117,hospital_throwawei,Updates,c2sc74,4053,"In the original post, [I described](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) the predicament of my dear friend, a >30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad.

I'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.

His suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.

I'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, ""you're so good to me."" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.

On social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion. 

I don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.

TL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it. 

People are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, ""Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside."" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic.

I apologize for not updating sooner, but a lot happened the last couple of days.  Thank you to everyone who offered help and advice.  For those that offered monetary assistance, Jonah and I were in a stable position financially -- I'm going to be comfortable until I decide to go back to work.  Your willingness to help was deeply appreciated, however, and I'm truly bowled over by your kindness.

I took the advice of the majority of comments, and called the chapel where Marjorie was planning her service.  I spoke with the pastor, who immediately told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me regarding the service -- apparently both Jonah and Marjorie had grown up in that church (I am not religious, and neither was Jonah as an adult).  My voicemail has been flooded, so it's definitely plausible that I overlooked his call. 

He immediately expressed how sorry he was to hear of Jonah's loss, and said he had received my contact info from Jonah's great-aunt who still attends there.  He said he was surprised when Marjorie asked to have a service for Jonah, but she had claimed that Jonah and I were separated and I didn't want to be involved.  He had been trying to follow up with me, but obviously that didn't happen.

He was very apologetic, and said that we could cancel the service, or move forward in any way that felt right to me.  He said that he knew the church members would appreciate the service, since many of them remembered Jonah as a boy, but obviously Marjorie would no longer have a role.  I agreed that the service could go forward.

He called to speak with Marjorie after our conversation, and informed her that she was no longer welcome to participate in the organization of the service after her behavior.  He wouldn't tell me all that she said, but says she was distraught, and he recommended some mental health/spiritual services to her that he hopes she accepts.  She apparently apologized for lying, and asked to speak with me -- but I declined.  I feel bad if she's truly contrite, but I just have too much on my plate right now.

We had two beautiful services for my husband -- first the one at his hometown church, and then the non-religious one that I planned.  Everyone that came wanted to honor Jonah, and that's all that really matters.  I was told a dozen stories about him that I'd never heard before, and I laughed so hard I cried, then cried some more.  My cousin was on the lookout for Marjorie, and I honestly didn't think about her the whole weekend.  She turned up for the first service, and the pastor ended up speaking with her (unbeknownst to me).  My cousin says he was sympathetic but firm, and told her that her presence there would be inappropriate.  Surprisingly, she left without fuss.

I'm still not sure this situation is entirely resolved, but I got to lay my husband to rest in the way he deserved, and that's the most important thing to me right now.  

Thanks everyone for your support.

So it got a bit of attention so I wanted to do an update. Plus shit hit the fan over the last few days, so buckle yourselves in.

After we spoke about the original issue, things did get better. Then, little fragments of other controlling behaviour started to come out.
I thought we could work through them.

Until when things came to a head. I found out he had, in fact, cheated on me.
When I attempted to leave him over this, he became very, very abusive to the point where he was arrested. Three things, screamed, threatened me, trapped me in the house.

I?m crushed, but relieved I found out now. Staying with friends currently. Trying to process.

So, I guess, if there?s a moral to the story - don?t ignore signs of abuse?
But, I can?t help the sense that the escalation came out of nowhere, and how - before - if you?d tried to tell me this would have happened I would have laughed in your face. I guess I don?t know what I could have done to prevent this. 
The original issue seemed to be able to be worked through, but was masking... this.

121,Resentment_,Relationships,bvsdrb,4013,"My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He?s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could?ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018.

Since January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers ?raising? his children so he doesn?t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don?t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn?t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I?m not ready for a baby right now.  I?m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he ?saves lives everyday? and I don?t and ultimately most people could do my job with a ?little bit of common sense? whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don?t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn?t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams. 

I had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I?ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn?t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn?t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn?t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you?re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or ?keeping score? but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I?m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important.

TLDR: Things are getting better, slowly but surely.  

&#x200B;

After posting here, I took some of the comments about depression and talked to my SO about how he feels and what I can do to be a better support system for him. He's still continuing therapy and his medication is slightly helping (although it'll take a few more weeks to really kick in) but he registered for his prereq classes without me saying anything or reminding him and he has been trying to help with cleaning when he can. So there has been some overall improvement.

We also talked about Pokemon Go, how he's using it as a coping mechanism and how that's okay (I cannot stress enough how I want him to still feel okay playing), but also how we can't just drop everything all the time for it. We just got back from a small holiday trip and the entire time, he kept the Pokemon Go under control and played when we wanted but not when we were doing dinner, taking parents places, and such. He showed a lot of restraint and a lot of respect for the stuff we talked about. 

I have also done a few raids with him and his people from discord, and I'm really glad he has this group of random Pokemon people that he knows by their Pokemon nicknames and stuff. It's actually very sweet, and not forced socialization or awkward adult-friend-making...they just go do raids, trade pokemon and know each other from these small moments. It's good for him, especially as his social circle has shrunk over the past few years. It's all so low key and low pressure that I really do think it's healthy for him to do these raids and talk to people about his hobby.

I'm also trying to be receptive that his way of ""giving"" to me right now is by helping me with the game. He really likes to play PoGo with me and gets excited when I get a shiny or catch a legendary in a raid. I have to realize that while the depression stops him from acting like he cares about stuff like cleaning or eating, this is a small glimpse into what he can be like once he gets better again (and also, a glimpse of his old self). 

I wanted to thank everyone who shared their stories of depression and opened my eyes to the fact that there is so much more to being depressed than just being unmotivated/sad/empty. I had no idea that his motivation in the game was part of the depression and part of coping with life.

I've never really had good makeup. I usually get by okay with the cheap dollar store stuff, but Ive never really had anything ""good"". I mentioned it once to my boyfriend (of 5 months), not because I expected him to do anything about it, I was just talking in general.

My sweetheart of a boyfriend remembered that and a few days ago he randomly handed me a box with an absolutely amazing makeup set in it. it retails for something like $300 and I almost didn't want to take it because it seemed like too much. But my boyfriend just seemed happy I liked it and convinced me to take it.

I got to try it twice. The day I got it I tore into it as soon as I got home and tried some looks. I got to wear it one other time last weekend when I went on a date with the boyfriend and I got all dolled up for it. 

I intended to wear it last night for the same reason, but I went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet and my makeup set was gone! At first I immediately called my sister since we share the bathroom and I asked her where she put my makeup, but she told me she didn't touch it. 

After searching all over I still couldn't find it and asked my mom if she had seen a makeup set. She immediately told me she found one in my bathroom and took it ""back"" to hers. I asked her why she took my makeup set and she looked confused and told me it was hers.

I tried to tell her ""No, it was mine, Brian bought it for me."" But mom shook her head and said something like ""No 17 year old boy is buying something like that, it must be mine.""

I was getting upset and told her it was definitely, 100% mine and my boyfriend gave it to me,  but mom just told me that whether it was or wasn't doesn't matter because I don't need it.

She ignored me the rest of the night until she went to work. I tried going to get it myself but she left her door locked.

Finally today after I woke up I went downstairs and almost lost it because I'm about 99% sure she was wearing some of my makeup, and I told her again I want it back. She told me to drop it and she doesn't want to hear about it again.

I called my boyfriend to see if he had a receipt or something and he was *super* mad when I told him what happened, and he offered to come over and get it back, but I told him it wasn't a good idea to get in an argument now, so he is looking for a receipt to see if it helps.

What do I do? I want my make up back! It's the first decent set I've had, and it was a gift from someone I love! I swear my mom knows I'm telling the truth but just isn't budging for some reason. If she wanted to wear some I would have shared if she just asked, why did she have to take it?!?!

**tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.


Again, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM. 

So, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity. 

I wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to.

On Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home. 

On Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it. 

Throughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either.

So, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again. 

I feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time. 

Thanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it. 

**tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again. 

**quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them. ",1446999600.0,[UPDATE 2] I [21F] suspect that I may be my boyfriend [29M] of two years' side chick.,0.92

tldr: We are engaged and everyone is doing better.

My old post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oeq0k/i_30m_was_planning_to_propose_to_my_girlfriend/


Okay so in my last post my girlfriend was being very aggressive towards me about not proposing before her father passed away. She stayed relatively upset and cold towards me throughout the funeral, but afterwards it seemed like we started to get closer. That week was honestly living hell, having to go to a man I truly cared for's funeral, while his daughter is mad because she thinks i'm not proposing, all the while I am but cant tell her right now. It sucked

However, time went on and things started to get better. Two weeks after the funeral, early November, I talked to her Mom and she helped me develop a new plan. I had convinced my girlfriend to take the whole week of Thanksgiving off, which wasn't hard because she knew the first holiday without her father would be really hard. So I took her on a surprise trip (which was our original mountain trip just later). Our plan was to leave Sunday evening and return Wednesday in time to help her family prep for Thanksgiving.

So I decided Sunday was my day. Her mom took her out all day to help her get ready for our little get away (aka distract her). I started setting up my proposal.

I first took screenshots of all of the conversations her dad and I had via text about the engagement and printed them out. I was actually able to turn it into 15 individual screenshots of conversation. So I made them into a little book. I also included the picture I took with him the day I asked for his blessing and the two pictures i had of us three all together. 

I packed our bags for the trip and decorated the house in flowers and balloons so she'd know something was up as soon as she opened the door. When she opened the door she looked shocked and a little confused. Even more confused when I handed her a book and didn't get down on one knee. I had initially intended to get down on one knee while she read through our conversations but she started crying pretty hard and took the book to the couch in the living room, where I just kind of scooped her up in a hug and asked her to marry me. I had to awkwardly fish the ring out of my pocket and we didn't have the magical getting down on one knee moment, but through her tears she shook her head yes and hugged me, which I thought was even better than expected. 

Once she regained her composer she told me how excited she was, but asked if i would mind if we waited til Monday morning to go to the mountains because she wants to show her mom and brother the book and ring. I didn't care at all and we ended up spending the night at her moms house. We left Monday and had an amazing trip to the mountains and we tried to hit all of her dads suggested proposal spots while we were there and snap pics (even though the weather was a lot colder than when our initial trip was planned) We had an amazing Thanksgiving with our families and now we cannot wait to start wedding planning.

She decided she no longer wants to get married next October and I obviously understood.

I tend to get advice when I need it and this is when I need advice. 

We live in a moderate place (not US), it's not the most liberal area but also not the most conservative area either. My sister came out as a lesbian last year and it's been a very smooth process actually. People close to us are generally very understanding and people who aren't really need no reason to be close to us. She hasn't had any problems at school about this until yesterday.

She's dating a girl (very nice girl, I know her parents) and apparently the sports coach noticed this. She asked if she's the girl who lives with her brother, and when my sister said yes, she basically said that ""poor you, things like this can happen when kids don't have proper parents"" in front of some other students. She was shocked and said her if she can elaborate. The coach said ""it's not your fault honey, when you don't have a mother figure shit like this happens. They shouldn't give hothead boys custody of teenage girls. A real family should have adopted you when your mom died.""

My sister was angry and said in front of everyone that she should try to be a better mom herself before making comments about other people's parents, that they all know her daughter is a junkie and give guys blowjobs for a joint. She kicked my sister out of the sports class. I have confirmed that this is happened from a couple of her friends parents (that's exactly what my sister told me as well).

I was planning to call the school today but they called me earliest thing in the morning themselves, asking me to come in person to discuss my sister's ""behavior"".

My friend and his sister took me out to dinner to try to get my mind off of everything. At first, I wasn't really up to going, but I figured that it would be better to try to focus my mind on something different. My friends called up a couple of my other friends, and the 6 of us went out to dinner. At first, I wasn't really into it, I was kind of down, but my friends did anything and everything that they could to cheer me up. I can honestly say that I love my friends and everything that they've done for me.**

**My best friend's sister (Emily) went through all the messages on my phone from the both of them and deleted anything that didn't need to be on there. She texted both of them from my phone telling them that it was her that was texting, and told her that a friend would be by at a certain time to pick up my stuff tomorrow, and she told him that I would be by tomorrow to grab some things and that I was going to try to get out of the lease by talking to my landlord.**

**I want you all to know that I've read through each and every one of these comments, and that I've read through every message that's been sent to me on here. I plan on replying to a couple tonight or tomorrow (I'm really tired, but wanted to let you all know how much you've helped me).**

**Finally, to the people that have been in the same position as I'm currently in, or to those that have been in a situation even relatively similar, I have a couple things. First, none of what your ex-SO did, says anything about you. It tells what kind of person THEY are; your reactions tell the kind of person that you are. Secondly, all of you are MUCH stronger than you realize. Many of you have given me such amazing advice, and you know exactly where I'm coming from. Talking about it isn't always the easiest, and many of you did to try to help an internet stranger, so thank you. Finally, many of you have much greater things to look forward to. Like one of old teachers said, ""it's like moving on to the next book in the sequence. Yeah, you may have to wait a little bit for the author to release it, but it's worth the wait.""**

**Also, to the kind individual that gave me gold, thank you. I plan on donating $5 tomorrow to a charity because of you. For anybody else that would like to, pick your favorite charity, and donate, or just do something nice for somebody else, it can have a huge impact on their life.**

Throwaway, my girlfriend and roommate reddit.

My last class of the day was cancelled, so I decided to come home and surprise my girlfriend. I went to the store and grabbed everything to make her favorite meal (lasagna). I was carrying the bags up the stairs and put them down in front of the door to fish my keys out of my pocket and then I heard my girlfriend moaning.

I thought that she was ""taking care of herself"" because I know that she likes to do that sometimes when I'm not around, so I didn't have a sudden ""ah-ha"" moment or anything. I walked in and there were her and my roommate on the couch.

I opened the door and kind of just froze when I saw it. She looked up and me and he turned around and saw it was me, and I just saw red. As much as I wanted to, I didn't kick his ass. I just dropped the bags and walked away.

As I was getting into my car, they both came running out and yelling at me to stop, but I just floored it and got out of there as quickly as I could. I called my best friend and talked to him about it. He offered to come kick his ass, I told him no. I didn't want him to get in trouble from it.

I even had the engagement ring that I planned to use to propose to her this summer when we went on vacation. It's in my safe that I keep in the closet, so I know that she doesn't know about it. But I planned to spend the REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER! Why didn't I see this coming?

My last class was supposed to start at 12, but since it was cancelled, I was home by 12.30. So it's been 4+ hours. My phone has been blowing up from both of them, I haven't looked at any of the messages or answered any of the calls.

I called my bank and made sure that she wasn't on any of my accounts for anything. I'm going to go back later tonight and pack up all of her stuff and drop it off at her place tomorrow. Then I'll probably take a bag of clothes to my friend's house and stay there until school ends (3 weeks).

She wasn't the one who took my blood for the test and as far as I know, the nurses don't actually do the lab work. 

Anyway, I got a call from my sister a few days later saying ""Tina"" told her my TB test was positive. Now, due to the nature of my grad school subject I know that sharing medical information is HIGHLY prohibited and she could get fired or worse. I don't really care if my sister knows my test results, but apparently she was talking about this at a party. It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that. 

Initially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing.

They said I was being too ""extreme"" and that he would stop eventually, but that shit has been going on since we were kids and I knew he wasn't going to stop, so I gave them an ultimatum. They would talk to my brother and my brother would stop or the 3 of them could have a nice life.


My parents talked to him, after all. My brother refused to get evaluated at first... he was really upset. He went over to my dorm and tried to choke me. He screamed at me, then he tried to choke me, then he realized what he was doing and started crying and apologizing. Someone called the cops because my brother tried to kill himself afterwards.


Anyway, everything is ok now. I mean, not everything. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He didn't get a full-written report because it's been a week and it takes time, but that was the feedback and diagnosis. I'm going to be ok.
I just wanna say thank you for the advice and stuff, you know. I appreciate it (a lot). <3

130,pizza12355uqu,Non-Romantic,a6g9dk,3931,"Alright so I married my husband (37M) about 6 months ago. He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years.

They got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her.

After Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her.

We didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it. 

We dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted.

Then I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now.

I am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this? 

Tldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it.

UPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said ""We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior."" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life.

My original post didn?t get tons of attention but I figured I?d provide an update for those interested. 

**TL;DR:** I talked to my husband about how our household responsibilities are far from equally shared. He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well. 

After finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load. 

This came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental ?inventory? I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don?t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it?s not good for anyone. A kind of ?emergency? situation would arise. 

If my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part. 

After explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his ?radar? for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn?t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better. 

He also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he?s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn?t require me asking. 

In the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do ?Does not go unnoticed? and that he is so thankful for all that I do. 

It feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here?s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :)

Hi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks!

So I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it.

Thankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family.

My husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype ""consult"". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard.

They scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home!

Bill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep.

I don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as ""personal development"" because there are still decent people in the world.

**tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**

Thanks everyone for the advice. It was very helpful. This was a very stressful and long few days. I'm just glad there seems to be a resolution. I had tried talking to my girlfriend and she was still clearly upset. I approached the conversation as many people said keeping an understanding that she was more disappointed than controlling and would come around. Unfortunately she was being unreasonable. She said ""I could go"" but that doing so would hurt her a great deal and that she would need some time to reevaluate things. I should have just ended things with her there but I was so sick of these tickets by this point that I didn't even have the heart to go even if I did decide to end things with her. As suggested by some of the comments here, I called up the radio station and asked if it was at all possible to transfer the tickets to my brother so he could go with his wife. They were totally understanding and awesome about it and said they were sorry I couldn't go but they were glad to put the tickets in my brothers name for me. I was just glad to have it behind me at that point. 

I told my girlfriend what I did and that I was staying here and she said that I was ""being dramatic"" and ""immature."" She said that I transferred the tickets to my brother just so I could ""win"" the argument and look like a martyr. It was at this point I reached my breaking point. I calmly told her this relationship was over. I wasn't even mad at this point just confused that a person I thought I knew could act this way. She said she was gonna break up with me because of the way I handled this anyway so breaking up with her ""didn't matter."" 

My brother immediately told me I dodged a bullet and glad that she was out of everyone's lives. My brother's wife was totally cool about me using her ticket and didn't even question it even after I'm technically taking back my gift to her. They insisted that I go with my brother and it was their idea. So now I'm the guest of my original tickets that I won. Happy to say I arrived in SF a few days ago and am having the time of my life. My girlfriend didn't unfollow me on social media and I'm posting as many pictures as I possibly can. Thanks everyone!

This is a really happy update!

I ate lunch outside today and I was sitting alone when four girls approached me. They had that they had all moved from different states and countries, and asked if they could sit with me. I was prepared to eat alone or approach some people like you guys said- so this was a relief! 

Of course I said yes! And we really hit it off. We walked around the school after we were done and chatted. We made a group chat and agreed to sit together again tomorrow!

They're all really nice and I think we're going to be good friends.

I'm really glad I made some new friends- I'm not that scared of high school anymore!

The only bad thing that happened is I lost my textbook! I looked everywhere for it but it's gone. I don't even know where I left it... I feel awful and hope my teacher isn't mad. :(

Well, I've had an eventful 24 hours.

So to recap: on the 16th, my best friend Sara, who is friends with my boyfriend Alex, decided to warn me that my boyfriend was going to take me skydiving for my birthday, to which I completely freaked out about.

So I read through everyone's responses. Towards the end I was watching videos of first time skydivers over and over again, trying to psych myself up to do it, since I decided I'd probably regret it if I didn't go (even if I had a panic attack on the way there.)

Alex came over the night I posted??I didn't mention the skydiving to him exactly, but I did reiterate and try to explain how bad my fear of heights was??and he was acting rather odd about it. He understood it completely, but just smiled and said, ""Don't worry about it, we'll get through it together.""

He then took a really quick exit. I tried getting in touch with Sara, but she wasn't picking up her phone; she just texted me to come over at night.

So later that evening (on the 17th, the day before my birthday) I went over to Sara's, who lives in the same building as me. A few of my girlfriends/future flatmates were there. We chilled for a while, I talked about how terrified I was to skydive but that I'd decided I would give it a try. Sara had a weird, half-amused look on her face, and just replied, ""Oh it'll be over soon! He just wants to help you get over your fear!""

Then around 11 PM I got a random text from Alex telling me he was coming over. He came over to Sara's and the two of them couldn't stop giggling. At midnight on the 18th they both wished me a happy birthday? then Alex said, ""So, Sara told me you already know what I'm going to get you.""

To which I replied, ""Yeah?""

And then Alex said, ""Well, in about eight days, we're going skydiving from the highest drop in Europe.""

I started visibly freaking out at this point. Alex and Sara burst into laughter. Then Sara said, ""Fuck, I can't keep this up anymore, I feel so bad. We're joking. We wanted to scare you!""

Alex grabbed my hand and he said, ""Of course I wouldn't take you skydiving! I don't want to kill you! We just really wanted to fuck with you since we knew you were catching onto us? Your real present is around the corner.""

So I looked around the corner and there was a fishtank, all set up with a couple exotic fish, a heater, and a filter (just like I wanted)! My babies are safe and sound and I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane, reddit!

He apologised profusely and said (since a few days earlier I was beginning to to catch onto the idea that they were getting me fish) that he wanted to make sure my present was a surprise and that he had no idea how deep my fear was. He said he was extremely sorry he'd ever caused me to freak out like that, but that he was never planning on taking me skydiving.

Now Alex is taking me to the Natural History Museum and we're gonna go for bubble tea and pancakes. I'm thrilled to pieces. This has been a really good birthday.

136,secondwife9,Relationships,53w447,3882,"My husband ""Nick"" was married to his first wife ""Vanessa"" for 5 years and they had two amazing kids, ""Luke"" (15/M) and ""Lila"" (13/F). Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. 

After 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. 

I have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son ""Casey"" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. 

But Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. 

Last week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's ""real"" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd ""keep busy and leave him alone.""

I'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye.

I'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids.

137,at_my_wits_end473984,Relationships,abjake,3877,"Hi all. 

I'm a law student, and met my boyfriend Tom through mutual friends around the start of our first year. We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education. 

In Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''. 

Anyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''. I was a bit hurt and Tom was confused, but neither of us thought much of it. 

Anyway, we didn't deal with her again until a month or so later when Tom's flatmates left the place to him so he invited me over. We were watching a movie when Tom got a call from Isabel, who was crying, saying she'd been kicked out of a club for being stoned and it was nearby his place, asking if she could stay the night until the morning. Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there. 

When she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her. 

Ever since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out. 

Ever since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming. He swore at her and blocked her on everything. 

That's good, but when we go back to uni she's still going to be around. Her and her friends frequent most of the places we go to, and she's still in his class. What's going to stop her from bothering him again? He's said he wants nothing to do with her, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way.

It's been a year, ""Eli"" and I are both a year older now than before, imagine that.

I began taking my antidepressants a few months after the original post was made. I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy.

&#x200B;

Just earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going. I still care about him immensely, and because I care about him so much I knew it was best to cut things off if I could not see the relationship progressing further after 3 years of dating.

Thanks everyone. You are very helpful.

I called my grandparents on Saturday afternoon and told them everything. I had taken a few pictures from my sister that night and emailed them those pictures as well. They were pissed off and angry at him and my mom for not standing up for us. They told me to stay upstairs and don't apologise and they will come over on Sunday morning. So we did that. My mom came to talk to us again on Saturday evening, insisted that we can go apologise and we can all forget that it happened, but we kept refusing until she gave up. Later that night my mom came back up to talk to me again and wanted me to end this ""rebellion"" as she put it, saying that it won't lead to anything good and it just makes things worse. I told her that I'm just protecting sister. She said ""it's my job not yours"". I said ""clearly you're not doing it well enough so I'm gonna have to do it"". She gave up again. 

So grandparents came over on Sunday morning. Mom and step father were home as well. We were upstairs and couldn't hear what they were saying but I could hear that my grandparents were very angry. I don't know what happened but after a while my mom came up and asked us to come down. We went down and Stap-father apologised to my sister and said it won't happen again and that he will make it up to us. My grandfather told me to let him know ASAP if something like this happened again.

After they left my mom looked very angry at me but didn't say anything.

P.S. I didn't call the police in the end. I was afraid to make the situation worse and make a much larger mess. I though involving grandparents is enough and they know better whether to call the police or not.

tl;dr: My wife and I are in an arranged marriage, my friends and co-workers have mocked and made fun of both her, and our marriage, how can I deal with this? while also helping my wife feel better and more confident?

After reading through the comments on my previous post, it really surprised and shocked me how many people thought my friends were racist, bigots, or assholes. It struck a chord deep in me with how many outsiders had such a different perspective on the issue, where I thought I wasn?t being firm enough and my friends were just ignorant in terms of the ramifications of their actions, whereas the vast majority of commentators thought they were just plain assholes and racists. I guess I was hoping if I was simply firm in my resolve, and told them in no uncertain terms if their disrespectful behavior were to continue we could no longer continue socializing, they would see the error in their ways and hopefully apologize to my wife. 

So yesterday, I asked them if we could all meet up to discuss something important, and after work we all went for drinks. Once we started talking, I told them how disrespectful they were being towards both my wife and I, and addressed how much it had hurt my wife to be made fun of just because of her accent and ignorance when it comes to American customs. I continued by saying that I understand we usually joke about these sorts of topics, such as race, but that I now realized how wrong it was and it all needed to stop. They did not take me seriously at all. Immediately everyone began commenting on how much of a ?bitch? I?d become since getting married, and I was always so prissy and sensitive about shit we?d used to laugh about all the time. They continued by saying I never enjoyed myself anymore, and how I?d basically abandoned our group because I was always spending time with my wife. I was constantly trying to respond, or defend myself, but the fuckers kept interrupting me and wouldn?t let me say anything. They also said I stopped partying like I used to, like what the fuck? Sorry I?m not interested in getting shitfaced at the club every Friday night, we?re not in college anymore. Then one of the guys says, ?Are you being all uptight because you?re not getting laid anymore? I?m surprised man, if my wife was as hot as (my wife?s name) I?d be banging the shit out her everyday.? Then all of them fucking laughed like he?d made a hilarious joke instead of being a massive douche bag. After that I was done with them, and told them they I no longer wanted to socialize with people who were being completely disrespectful and held bigoted attitudes towards my wife, then left. 

Once I got home, my wife immediately asked what was wrong. I suppose I must?ve still looked pissed off over what transpired.  I told her how sorry I was over the way I handled the situation, and she would no longer have to deal with their mocking and bullying. She looked extremely guilty that I said this, and told me I didn?t have to sacrifice my happiness and friendships just to please her, and I should continue hanging out with them if I really wanted to. I don?t know, I?m kind of embarrassed to admit it but I started crying like a baby. This women, who?d left everything behind, her life, family, friends, to travel halfway across the world to a completely different country all on the promise that I would provide her with a better life, thought this entire situation was her fault, and was saying I should prioritize my happiness over her own feelings or well-being. It broke me, and made me realize what a selfish prick I was. So I spent over an hour convincing her this wasn?t her fault at all, and that she should never believe my feelings are more important than her?s, and whenever she is feeling hurt, or angry, she should express those feelings without ever thinking it was wrong to do so. I?m very saddened by how long I had allowed this to transpire, and have a ton of making up to do. 

Also, I just wanted to express my thanks reddit. This was the main reason I posted an update, your guys? comments really helped take the wool off my eyes and understand the reality of the situation. We?re in a much better place now because of it, and I truly do appreciate everything, thank you.

He called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason.

First I want to clear some things up about my job. I work 4AM-8PM Monday through Friday. I get paid for driving, so the 2 hour commute to and from work is included in those hours, not on top of them. I don?t work for any school - my company is a contractor with many different schools. It is illegal to make employees work so many hours where I live, but most of the people who work here either don?t care because the money is so good or they quit early on. I don?t want to say what I do specifically because from there it would be easy to find out what company I work for which I imagine could get me in legal trouble.

I didn?t want to call my doctor yesterday because I was afraid to leave work and because I didn?t want my coworkers or anyone at the school to hear what was going on. However, I ended up doing so because I noticed there was a teacher with my last name (which is also my dad?s, and is quite rare unlike the girlfriend?s common name) and I panicked a little. I excused myself to the bathroom and called my doctor, who advised me to come in, and then I told me coworkers I had to leave because of a medical emergency.

I was not medicated before, but I have now started a new medication which will hopefully work. I have some mental exercises that I used the one other time I have had a really bad delusion like this (I thought my house was infested with fleas but they were really just on the dog) and they?re helping to ground me. I think I am afraid of my dad trying to get back into my life (he does this every so often) which is why I jumped straight to thinking it was his ex stalking me, and my doctor agrees.

I also have put in my two weeks notice at work. I have enough money to get by for the next few months if I can?t get another job right away, and this job is destroying me physically and mentally.

I did also buy a CO detector but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I also live with my fianc? who is not having similar symptoms.

Thank you to everyone who replied to the original post. I?m sorry I worried you.

143,johnl989,Relationships,9vrxi5,3820,"I'm kind of a moron sometimes when it comes to being aware of my wife's sensitivities. But I love her so much, and she loves me, so it's seriously bothering me that I screwed up. She is the best wife a man could ask for. We've been married for 4 years. She gave birth to our second child a few months ago. As you would expect we've been quite emotionally attached to one another during her pregnancy and after she gave me our second son, but when I offended her a week ago she has sulked and ignored me as much as possible.

I rush home from work like I have been doing, eager to see my wife and our sons, but now she says ""you're dinner's on the table"" and she leaves me alone to eat while playing with our son and holding the baby. We've always had a ritual that has been extremely important to me: I get home from work and we make out for about 5 minutes, act all lovey-dovey, then we eat together with the boy(s). It's been devastating for her to abruptly change like this.

So here's the stupid thing I did. When we married she was very skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot). Since having the first child she has steadily gained weight and become a little plump. Her body definitely has changed and she's not looking skinny and petite. But she's still just as beautiful and this has never been something I've seen in a negative light. But this was apparently devastating to her self-esteem, to an extent that I wouldn't have imagined. I've always told her when we're intimate or she's getting changed near me that she's so beautiful. In fact as she's gained some weight I've said it more and I can sometimes barely keep my hands off her when we're alone and she's changing or something. Yet she's always responded to this by saying ""she's gotten so fat"", ""I'm hideous"", ""I'm sure not what you signed up for am I"", and all that crap. One night I said the wrong thing (though I didn't know it would be when I said it): I kissed her thighs and said ""your curves have gotten so amazing"" and she just flipped out and started crying, saying ""so now you're just acknowledging how fat I've gotten out loud"" and she's been seeming sulky ever since.

When I told her that she's not ""fat"", that she's just as beautiful as before and actually more so, she just gets more upset. How do I fix this stupid mistake I made? I love my wife more than anything, and she's never gotten this upset or sulky before.

The advice I received was superb, and all the stories shared were extremely relevant and eye opening. I read every comment, and realized I used the word ""codependent"" wrong after someone pointed that out. 

I told her I was worried for her health, and I wanted to get her professional help before things turned really bad. It took a lot of convincing but eventually she went to the doctor with me. She was diagnosed with depression, and prescribed antidepressants (SSRIs). I also booked an appointment with a therapist, and the plan is for her to go once every week.

My girlfriend felt sad about the whole thing, and asked if I was going to leave her. I told her I wasn't, especially in a time of need. I reassured her about everything and said I loved her. I mentioned that I couldn't be her whole support network though, and being entirely dependent on me wasn't healthy for either of us. I said I would still visit her, but only on the condition that she sees her therapist every week, and she reluctantly agreed.

I knew the next morning she was going to beg me to come over. I was right. I told her I looked forward to seeing her in the afternoon, but I wasn't coming over. She started crying and I had to walk her through what to do on the phone. It sucked, I really wanted to go over and comfort her, but I wasn't going to feed her dependency.

The same thing happened the next morning, but this time I didn't guide her on what to do. I couldn't focus at school because I was worried if my girlfriend could function by herself. I called one of her co-workers and asked if she came to work. She did, she was a little sad but otherwise fine. 

I was finally able to get her to accept help from her friends, after she had neglected them for 3 weeks. They planned a girls night out. My girlfriend finally got out of the house, spent time with someone other than me, and according to her friends she had a lot of fun. She has been talking to her best friend again, and it's been a huge weight lifted off my back having another person for her to talk to.

I'm visiting my girlfriend every other day, instead of everyday like before. I don't know how long her depression will last or if it'll ever go away, but I'm completely okay going through this with her. She?s in a depressed mood for most of the day, but the antidepressants will start helping, she's becoming a little more independent each day, and talking to her friends again.

I'm disappointed in myself for not getting her help earlier, and to be honest if I didn't write my post I'd still be feeding her dependency. 

Seriously though. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who responded. This update is the least I could do. Thank you <3

**tldr: After some convincing my girlfriend went to the doctor with me, and she was diagnosed with depression. I booked an appointment with a therapist and she is seeing her every week.

146,Throwawaymanic654321,Non-Romantic,9jxf3j,3778,"Warning, wall of text - but suffice to say this isn't your typical MIL move in post.

My wife and MIL have a toxic relationship. Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died. 

Despite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months.

How did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years.

One of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it.

Fast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom. 

Of course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us.

This is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future.

This would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person. This isn't just my opinion, I've sat in my wife's therapy sessions and heard her say all these things about MIL.

My wife knows how terrible she is, how much I dislike her (but don't show it to MIL) but I  understand how my wife has to do this. Any tips on making it work? I honestly don't want to be at my home.  I'd rather work late, travel more and be out of that place. I love my wife and kids and would miss them terribly but MIL makes me miserable and my wife miserable abd she lashes out at me and the kids.

Sorry for not responding to any of the original comments. Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice. 

I did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own.

I took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc. 

I ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well. 

I would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished.

I didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture!

I gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person. 

This has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here! This was seriously an amazing experience.

Before I update, I just want to thank everyone. It was nice to see that not everyone called me a selfish a.hole and actually gave me great points to consider. 


I took the advice about making spreadsheets and discussing having separate accounts for things such as ""disposable savings"" ""bills"" ""emergencies/if one of us loses income/accidents"" ""holidays"" ""college found"" etc 

I sat Tara down yesterday after a nice day out with our dogs and told her I'd like to discuss finances and our future and asked her how she felt about things. 


I tried to be as respectful as I could, and I told her that while I respect her need to take care of her family, i wanted us to be prepared so that we weren't left in a dangerous situation ourselves, especially if we want kids, we should consider what would happen if one of us or both dies, or accidents/illnesses. 


She was actually very open about it all and agreed with most of it. She said although she doesn't keep separate accounts for everything, she has a set % in mind when helping her family. 


I knew she had savings set aside for emergencies and also for a house but what I didn't know was that she has started saving for her siblings tuition - a very decent amount)  She has been saving a lot more than I thought she did. I'm still amazed at how she was able to save so much. She showed me her accounts and needless to say I was embarrassed for thinking she would give away all her savings, I should of known she was smarter than that.  


I also discussed what would happen if she thought we didn't need something but we wanted it, and consider several scenarios. She wants to travel the world with me so she's fine with that as long as I don't exaggerate with expensive champagne and caviar  for breakfast she's fine with us indulging a little. 


She is against wasting money though, so she made it clear she won't be buying expensive brands herself but said she won't tell me off for the things I do, which is fine with me. 


The only thing she said would annoy her is if I ever bought an expensive car (100k +) She thinks they're a waste as most lose value pretty fast which is fair enough. 


The other issue about messiness, 


She actually offered a chore list and asked if I wanted to cook or clean, I'm actually hopeless at cooking and she is the best cook I've ever met so we decided she would cook and I'll help with the cleaning. She doesn't mind getting extra help (cleaner) from time to time as well since we will both be pretty busy


We also decided to have separate wardrobes so that she can chuck her stuff in without messing with mine lol 


All in all things are looking good, I now have to plan the proposal, can't wait to start my life with this amazing woman. Thanks everyone

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us.

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was.

150,somethingaboutaplant,Updates,4qxomu,3741,"Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates.

[Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/)

So, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: ""How would you feel if I stopped working?"" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of ""If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?""

I wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead.

I've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day.

Wake up in the morning and he says ""...don't you have work today?"" and I'd be like ""Eh, I don't feel like it"".  The first few days he was like ""Awesome!"" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like ""So...what's up with work?"" and I tell him ""Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it"".  After the second week he says ""What's going on?!"" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to ""the machine"" either, so I'll just stay here with him.  

He FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks.

I kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah.

Anyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event.

I'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p

Anyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!


**tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again.

Edit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual ""reaction"", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a ""what's good for the goose..."" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was.

Basically...to this day he still believes he's ""right"", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really.

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mb89u/girl_20sf_who_my_23f_ex_23m_cheated_on_me_with/

Hi all, my initial post didn't garner much attention, but I wanted to give a short update.

I never responded back to Jessica and basically told her that while I understood she was guilty there really isn't anything she can and should do for me. Just that she has to make better decisions now and hopefully her guilt would mean she wouldn't hurt another person like that again. 

During the Holidays, my ex's dad greeted me a Merry Christmas. I was also told of the news that Jessica was 4-5 months pregnant with my ex's child. :O It lines up now, and I guess that's why she messaged me, because they found out around that time. Just wish she was really sorry lmao. 

After that my ex and I had the chance to talk. While of course I was still not ok with the fact that he cheated on me, I wouldn't wish ill on an unborn child. He has a lot of growing up to do, and is not the most financially stable person. It also turns out the girl is quite young. I told him that I wished him well despite everything. His dad told me that he still believes he can make something of himself. 

When my ex and I talked, he admitted to me that the reason he cheated was because he knew I was already going to break up with him. This is partly true because months before, I sat him down and talked to him about issues in our relationship, and I had wanted to bring his attention to the fact that things really were no longer healthy. I guess it was my prelude to an amicable break-up. He told me that there really was a better way to break things off, but that he was too scared to be alone after breaking up. So he made sure he had someone to run to when we finally broke things off. I just really wish we could have ended things better, he was my best friend. 

The news shocked me, but in a way I guess I was able to get closure. I'm currently in a good and healthy relationship and starting the year with a really great outlook.  

Thank you all for the advice! I wish everyone had a great holiday!

**EDIT:** Oh wow, I really wasn't expecting this to blow up! I thought my post was locked but glad I checked. I was sick last night and only had the chance to see it now!

Just a few clarifications because a lot of people have questions. I'm sorry I wasn't too clear on the details, as I didn't want to submit such a lengthy post. I realized after re-reading my post how confusing I was! My apologies :)

First is that yes, I did respond back to Jessica (the message I detailed in this post) ~~before~~ after (sorry I made a mistake!) the reddit post, but she responded again. I no longer messaged back after, hope that's clear.

You are all correct, based on the timeline she did get pregnant after we broke up/I discovered his cheating. What I didn't mention or was fully clear with yet is, around 4 or 5 months ago, my ex talked to me and told me that she and Jessica broke up, because they realized that they were in a relationship for the wrong reason. We talked for closure, but I realize now he was also testing the waters with me. I could be wrong tho! 

There are a number of people who also question why I kept in contact with people in my ex's life, or why I even talked to him after everything. I agree that it isn't the most healthy or mature, and I call myself out on that a lot of times. It was just really hard to detach from his family, who I grew close to. When my ex's dad last talked to me, he told me that things will never change and he still loves me like a daughter. :') And while a lot of people don't agree with my last communication with my ex, I think it was helpful for both of us in the process of moving forward. I think we left the conversation clearing out that we don't have hate for each other, just wishing each other well. 

Also, I have to admit that I don't have the most positive image of Jessica, and I watch myself a lot of times not to be hateful. It's hard to judge when you only have the negative things shown to you. She did a lot of hurtful things to me (outside the cheating), but in the grand scheme of things, I really don't know the full story anyway. With how the chips fell, I think all I can do now is wish them the best. 

2018 was a tough year. Went through a break-up, was cheated on, lost my sister, had to re-contact my ex to get things my sister used to own back (these are the things I referenced to in my initial post), and basically had to pull myself back up after all the pain and losses. 

But I am glad to leave it all behind in 2018, and I am starting 2019 strong!

Thank you for all the positivity and warm wishes everyone! To a healthy year of growth ahead! :) ",1546850711.0,[UPDATE] Girl [20s?F] who my [23F] ex [23M] cheated on me with reached out to me. Not sure how to respond.,0.97

Original post TL;DR - Dumped ex for cheating. His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They?re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I?m not interested, but should I tell her?

&#x200B;

Update: Sorry for the delayed update for anyone that was interested, but I moved and life has been hectic. I read every comment on the original post and considered every option. A couple weeks after my ex initially contacted me via email, he sent me a text message asking if I would ever talk to him again. Like before, I didn't respond. A couple days after I moved, I messaged his gf/the previous ""other woman"" on Facebook since that was my only form of contact with her. I first asked if they were together, to which she responded ""yes"" a couple days later. In a brief conversation I told her that I felt I owed her the courtesy since she once extended the same to me. I told her he had contacted me twice in the last month and gave her the gist of his email. She said she figured that's why I was contacting her, said she really appreciated me telling her, thanked me, and said she hoped I was doing well. I told her good luck and went on my merry way. No catfighting, no unnecessary chatting. 

In the end, I feel bad for her. Yeah, she made the horrible decision to get back with him but I'm sure she did hoping/thinking he had changed. He never will. Men like that don't. I was his unwitting fool for nearly 5 years, now she has that burden. I haven't heard from him since or heard anything from his family who still occasionally keep in touch as to whether she dumped him or not...my gut instinct is she didn't. Either way, my conscience is clear, a ""favor"" has been returned, and I'm still happily no longer with a cheater. Cheers folks!

Firstly, I just wanted to thank you guys for being so sweet in the last thread. I was so stressed out and you guys made me laugh. : )

First update was removed because I forgot a link, but I fixed it. Onto the update.

Before I posted, I was basically set on hiding awkwardly in my room or maybe dressing more conservatively when I left my room. After I saw all your responses, I was filled with a feminist, body-positive rage. These boys were not going to get away with slut shaming me. 

Of the three guys, I'm closest with Tom (Boy 1/3), so I decided to talk to him individually. I heard him coming up the stairs and I just took a deep breath and walked out of my room, smiled, and asked if I could talk to him for a minute. 

He came into my room and we were just making small talk. I shut the door, summoned all of my assertiveness, and said, ""So, I actually have something weird to talk to you about. I heard you guys talking about me the other day.""

I'd like to say that I threw down with this boy, that I told him that sexism is not cool or funny and I won't put up with it and demand that he apologize. But instead I, um. 

I cried. 

A lot. 

I straight up just broke down, I couldn't even speak. Tom look absolutely devastated. He immediately apologized, said I wasn't supposed to hear any of that, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was just trying to get a grip on myself. There's nothing more awkward than crying in front of someone when you're ""not on that level"" yet. 

Anyway, I asked him if that was really what he thought of me. He said no, and that they were just being dumb, and that when Sam (Boy 2/3) brought it up he was really surprised and knew it was wrong but he didn't call him out on it. He said he should have, and he knew he should have, but he didn't want to make a big deal about it because Sam and Bob (Boy 3/3) were just joking around, even though they were being mean. He said it was shitty of him not to call them out and that by not saying anything and acting like it was funny, he allowed it to happen. He said that he has no excuse and he's sorry.

This checks out- from what I heard, it was mainly Sam and Bob saying the bad stuff. I said I knew they were just joking around but it made me feel horrible to be talked about that way, and that the sexism really slapped me in the face. 

He agreed and said it was horrible, and he also said something like ""not that it's an excuse, but you're really pretty and I think thats why we were talking about you that way. none of us actually believed what we were saying but i think it was just wishful thinking and we were idiots about it."" 

So for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO. 

I laughed and told Tom that I had a girlfriend. He said that was totally cool, and then looked embarrassed and said they must have looked like complete idiots bragging about how much I wanted to sleep with them. I agreed. 

Tom asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it. I told him not to tell the other guys anything because I don't really want to talk about it anymore, but if they ever start talking about another person like that, even if it's not me, to speak up. He promised me he would and apologized about 9000000 more times and left. 

I heard him go into his room, and then immediately leave and go out the front door. I didn't think much of it and put my headphones in and played Trackmania for a while.

Later that day I opened my door and there was a big cardboard box right outside my door. My first thought was that I'd ordered something from amazon and forgot about it, but it looked like a used box that someone had repurposed and taped shut. I dragged it into my room and opened it. 

Guys. It was a bouquet of flowers and a cake with the word ""SORRY"" written on it. 

If you're thinking that I cried for the second time in three hours, well . . . you're right. 

Anyway, I'm sorry I didn't throw down with them like so many of you wanted. Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. I'm working a lot on being more assertive but in this scenario I handled it as best as I could. Confronting Tom about it was actually super scary, but I'm proud of myself for bringing it up at all. 

I accept Tom's apology. He seemed genuine, and this does seem like a one-off shitty behavior situation. He's usually a pretty stand-up guy. The other guys . . . I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't super sold on them to start with, so I feel like I'll just continue to not pursue a friendship with them. And I'll continue to dress however I want. : )

Lastly, serious thanks to all of you for your responses. I was hesitant to post this on reddit because reddit can sometimes be . . . not so nice about women's issues. But yall are cool. <3

&#x200B;

Lordy. Where do I begin. I need more help. 

&#x200B;

The guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina. 

&#x200B;

He would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth. 

&#x200B;

His start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his ""followers"". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are. 

&#x200B;

The problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't ""see"" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR. 

&#x200B;

For all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like ""enough is enough"" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly. 

&#x200B;

I'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say. 

&#x200B;

(tl:dr- grandmother said racist and derogatory things about my girlfriend in spanish right in front of her not knowing she could understand some spanish.) 

People gave me a really hard time in my original post and it really made me realize how much of a dumbass I was being. I apologized profusely to Olivia and called out my extremely stupid behavior and basically begged for forgiveness. After a couple more days of being mad at me she was willing to talk to my parents and my brother who apologized and told her that they really loved her and that they didn?t mean to hurt her. They tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and why she behaved the way she did and they were just trying to minimize drama but that what she was saying was wrong and they should have stood up to her. My mother got her a gift set from bath and body works, costume jewelry and chocolate to go along with the apology. 

So Olivia did forgive me and my family which I am so relieved about because I really am crazy about this girl. I?m definitely not going to take this for granted. A week ago my brother, Olivia and I went to an amusement park and my brother and her actually got along really well and she?s definitely convinced he doesn?t secretly hate black people. (I never thought my brother was racist - when he was in middle school he ?dated? a black girl.) He's only 15 so I definitely don't blame him for what happened. It was my dad's fault for laughing. But yeah he really likes her and is glad she doesn't hate him. My mom invited Olivia to a beach with our family on Saturday (My abuela stayed at home) and although she mostly stayed by me and my brother she seemed to get along reasonably with my parents and seems to believe their apology (she was a bit hesitant to go). 

I have told my grandmother that if she wants me to be actively part of her life she must apologize to Olivia. My grandmother actually agreed to apologize but my gf doesn?t want to talk to her and I told her I will not force her to be around her but I did tell her that my grandmother is sorry for the way she behaved. 

So yeah that's my update. I appreciate all the replies no matter how harsh. It really made my realize my stupidity. Still have a lot of growing up to do but I am really happy she took me back.

156,shitsand,Non-Romantic,44xv3j,3676,"I've lived in this apartment complex since I moved out of my parents house when I was 18. I love this building, love my home, and I've never had a problem with any of the other tenants. 

A new family just moved into the apartment next to mine. At first, everything was fine. Their son was a little noisier than I'd like, but it's just something to get used to.

About two weeks ago, the Mom approached me and took me to the side. She told me that she liked the apartment, everything was fine, except for one thing: her son's room was next to mine, and he could very obviously hear me having sex with my boyfriend.

I apologized and said I'd try to keep things a little quieter. She told me that she thinks it's for the best if I move my bedroom, or have sex somewhere else, just in case her son hears. I told her that wasn't going to happen, but I would definitely try to be more courteous about timing.

Fast forward to this past week. My boyfriend (who lives with me part-time, but is a grad student on the go most of the time, so we don't always see each other) was over, and we ended up having sex. It was probably 4 in the afternoon. While we're going at it, there's a knock on the door. I'm not expecting anyone, so we ignore it, and the knocking continues.

Then comes the shouting. I need to stop, I'm being disgusting, don't I know there's a child in the next apartment, I'm a degenerate, I'm a slut, I'm a hooker, etc etc etc. She went away eventually, but not after yelling some more.

Now, I don't know. Am I being unreasonable about this? I don't think it's fair for me to have to adhere to someone else's schedule just because their son shares a wall with me. We aren't screaming banshees and slapping the headboard against the wall, but we're two adults doing what we love doing. 

The woman caught me leaving for work this morning and told me that if I didn't stop ""exposing myself"" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing. 

What am I to do here?

157,cheekyhotchickenroll,Non-Romantic,4lyc9a,3673,"Yes reddit, I know how hilarious this sounds and I promise you this is not a joke as I am genuinely freaking out right now. I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resum? I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others.

I (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies & passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying ""garlic bread"".

Now, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resum?.

I came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resum? (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to ""garlic bread"" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total.

It was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resum?, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification.

My sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words ""I'm sorry"" definitely left her mouth.

Then she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like ""just a prank brah"" mentality but I'm having none of it.

I don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the ""garlic bread"" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob?

Technically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resum?-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resum? fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resum?? Should I just fucking move town at this point since I've clearly made a fool of myself already? Also, how do I talk to my parents or sister about her stupid spoilt bratty behavior?

158,marrisilver,Relationships,7j6hws,3662,"This is a really strange situation. I hung out with a guy I sort of know at a bar for a while, and he asked to see my gaming PC so we went over my apartment. Jokingly, his friends were saying we were going up there to fuck (I live above the bar). We did a tiny bit of coke while we were up there, hung out and played games and talked about the PC for like maybe an hour and a half or so, then he went back down and I stayed up there. 

While he was down there, I dont know what got into him, but he must have told his friends some story that ended with us having sex. Or its possible one of his friends just thought that? I have no idea, he was really coked up when he left downstairs so I assume it was him who told the story. 

the next day I awoke to a whole lot of people messaging me saying that they heard me and george (the guy) had sex and that they had no idea I was gay and they wanted to congratulate me and all that. I am not sure HOW this spread so fast, but 4 people hit me up. Apparently the rumor developed into not only did I have sex with him, but I also came out to him as gay? 

Either way, I wrote a FB status right there and then seeking to end this tirade, saying it didnt happen, me and george didnt do anything, its just some weird lie or rumor. A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. Another girl wrote as her status ""when straight guys call a gay man a liar about them having sex just to protect his masculinity"" and it was kind of obvious she was referring to me. 

I dont even know what to say. For one, I hit up george, I called him, its been 4 days, zero response. I am not even sure if I have the right phone number. I am not even sure if its HIM spreading this rumor at all, it could have just been someone who saw him go up to my apartment. I've gotten a few more messages from people congratulating me for coming out, and that ""they had no idea!"" and stuff like that. I've told every single one, sorry, its just a rumor, some of them were like 'oh okay sorry'  and some didnt even respond, presumably because they saw my status and that guy who commented on it. 

I don't know what to do. I dont give a shit if I was gay, but I don't want to be known as gay when I am not. Its just a weird feeling because people have accused me now of homophobia over this and I just feel terrible because I have no bad feelings towards gay people, but I just want people to know, I am not gay. Like, this isn't true, at all. But now everytime I deny it it just looks worse. One of my friends hit me up and she said ""look, I know you are denying it, but on the chance you are gay and just feel embarrassed thats okay too!"" and it just made me realize I may never be able to shake this off

What the hell do I do? I barely even know this george guy, he might never respond!

My mom recently went on a work trip with her co-worker in Minnesota but after my step-dad found on Facebook that she was actually in Indiana, we all (me, my step-dad, and my four other siblings) soon figured out that she went there to see a prison inmate. 

We have no idea who this person is, we don?t know anybody in the prison system but recently my mom has been secretly making phone calls to an inmate we had no idea existed. She?d go take a call outside in or in her car, we all thought it was work but it wasn?t. 

My mom and step-dad also bought a house recently and we haven?t fully moved in yet. My step-dad is a great guy and he didn?t deserve to be lied to. My mom has a past history of lying like this and has also abandoned our family before for drugs, leaving us for two years and decided she wanted to be a mom again she came back. the reason I?m so upset because my step-dad is packing and leaving, he?s the only one that is teaching me how to drive and he?s super resourceful and is honestly the backbone of my family. 

When he leaves I won?t be getting driving lessons anymore (which I need in order to get a license and take my siblings to school). and my mom probably won?t afford to keep the house they just bought.

We each had kids from a previous relationship so I wanted to take the whole ""living together"" thing slowly, but we were together all the time (and I just maintained my own residence).



.





He commuted for work, and I knew his department got a new secretary.  She was younger and married and had recently had a baby.  I knew they were work buddies and I even bought a birthday gift for him to give to her.  After about a year she moved to another State.



.




My boyfriend and I decided to move in together and we lived together for a year when I found out that he and that secretary had some type of (non physical but still romantic) relationship while they were working together. And that is why she ended up leaving (because they both realized it was not appropriate).



.




I stumbled on old emails between them that were strange. Calling each other pet names. He was calling her baby and sweetie in work emails. Telling each other that they couldn't wait to see each other at work. Meeting up in the cafeteria for coffee every day. He told her he loved her. She lamented that she couldn't stop thinking about him while at home. They had little quarrels.  I also realized that he was still facebook friends with her.



.



We talked a lot about this and he said he was just so unhappy at work at the time and unhappy with our relationship (news to me??!) because we didn't live together that he was vulnerable to attention from a beautiful woman.  He said it never became physical but they were very emotionally entangled at the time for many months. I had no idea at all.  He said together they decided the best thing was for her to accept another job offer (which he helped her get).



.




He's very remorseful sometimes. Other times he will tell me that it's partially my fault because I rarely stayed over (I don't think that's true at all -- in fact I was the only one working on us -- he was so busy at work that I carried most of the relationship at that time).  I was doing everything for him to help him out because I knew how busy he was and how stressful life was for him back then.  He will also try to tell me I was too cold (again, he didn't bother mentioning that to me then).



.




I've tried to move past this. I told him he needed to delete her from facebook, and he did. It's been over a year since I found out but I still feel so much hurt and anger if I think about it, or if something triggers me (even something as stupid as a movie where the man is hooking up with his secretary).



.




It's been over a year of anger, fighting, hurt and drama. The man I thought I was with is not the guy who would speak to his married secretary like that.  Should I just give up? I'm tired of feeling this way.

I read all the replies and I had a long talk with my BF about boundaries. He listened, agreed with me, and decided to talk to his parents. I was hopeful and glad that he was going to do something about this, but things soon got much worse.


He returned home a few hours later with his parents! Silly me, I was assuming that they were here to apologize or at the very least have an adult conversation about everything that has been going on. 


1. They accused me of trying to keep him away from them and isolate him in order to abuse and control him. I told them that I was not, and never said that he shouldn't interact with them. All I wanted was for them to respect MY boundaries and stop making unreasonable demands. They said that this is what all abusers do, and that I am showing my true colors. The messed up part is that my BF was visibly affected by all this to the point of starting to agree with them!

2. They kept insisting that I was acting guilty, and that only guilty people have something to hide, and the fact that I'm refusing to show them my bank statements prove that their suspicions are correct. I told them that it is NONE of their business, and if my BF trusts me, what right do they have to interfere with my business? At that point his dad got in my face and screamed at me about being a horrible person who abuses their son.

3. They brought up a music festival I had attended last year with mutual friends of BF and I from college. They accused me of spending that weekend away prostituting myself instead of going to the festival, and when I countered with the fact that there was an entire album full of photos on my FB, they then changed their accusation to suspecting that I was dealing drugs! This was shocking to me as I have never dealt drugs in my life, and neither my BF, his parents, or anyone else has ever accused me of dealing drugs. I pointed out that their accusations keep changing the moment the first one is proven wrong, and how exactly am I supposed to prove a negative like that? Even if I gave them my bank statements, they would accuse me of having a different account, or of hiding cash, who knows what else? I told them that it is clear that it isn't going to stop, and therefore they should just stop bothering me with their insane theories and leave me alone. I guess this was my fault for going to the festival without my BF, but I had asked him to go along repeatedly but he kept saying that he doesn't like large crowds, which I have known about him from the start. I didn't think that there was an issue since I was camping with girls and my BF also knew these people from college. 

4. My BF then said that it could be a possibility that I was actually dealing drugs, that my refusal and anger at his parents' requests is making him no longer trust me and that he is starting to think ""where there is smoke there is fire."" WHAT. THE. HELL. I told him that he had never once accused me of prostitution or drug dealing before and these insane accusations only started once his parents put the idea into his head! If he was uncomfortable with me going to the festival, he could have spoken up before I bought the ticket, before I actually left, and if he was uncomfortable he could also have brought it up in the YEAR since then and now, but he didn't, and only started getting uncomfortable once his parents planted these ideas into his head.

5. I told them that I don't understand where these suspicions are coming from. I make a normal amount of money for someone in my position, I live below my means, I don't make any extravagant purchases, so why exactly do they accuse me of hiding so much money? What money? They then said that I am ""deflecting"" in order to not have to answer their accusations, that I had manipulated my BF into sticking up for me, and that the camping trip showed them how much I was abusing my BF, that their poor son has been so abused that he would deny that I was slapping him.


My BF said that since this conflict doesn't seem to be getting resolved, and since they are his parents after all and that he can't be with someone that refuses to get along with his parents, we are breaking up. Seriously. Those were his words. I am apparently the bad one in everything here and his delusional evil parents are not at fault. His parents helped him pack up and he went home with them.


His parents then said that they are going to call the cops on me for domestic violence and drug dealing. I am innocent, but I don't know what is going to happen now, if their insane calls to the cops are going to jeopardize my job in some way. I am so scared of these insane people and what they may end up doing. :(

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ent6r/i_24m_had_a_threesome_with_my_girlfriend_24f_and/

I got a few requests for an update, so I thought I'd post one.  Pretty much what everyone suggested would happen, we broke up. It wasn't nice though.

Honestly, I've been kind of regretting the threesome because more and more I feel like I was strongly manipulated; lead into believing it would be just no-strings fun whereas it was actually a vehicle for her to have sex with another guy.

I sat her down and said to her clearly, I've been thinking about her proposition, and she can have sex with the guy if she tells me who it is, and she has to be honest about if she had this person in mind from the start when she suggested it.

She became ecstatic to hear about this, and told me the person was ""Adam.""  I know ""Adam"", I've met him a few times, he works at the same place she does.

""I thought Adam is married"" I said

""He is, but he and his wife are swingers"" she tells me.

I then tell her ""like I said, you are free to have sex with Adam as much as you want, but our relationship is over.""

She then freaked out at what I said as she slowly realised I was serious and was ending the relationship out of the blue, she wasn't expecting it at all.  At first she thought I was kidding, then she became really angry at me and started shouting and going crazy.  She said all sorts of nasty things and told me I lied to her, deceived her, etc. because I had sex with another woman but won't let her have sex with another man.

I told her she's free to have sex with him now, because our relationship is over, and I don't want to be in a relationship with a woman who very clearly lusts after another man.

I then said to her something along these lines ""I feel like you manipulated me when you suggested the threesome; you said you just wanted to experiment but you were really trying to use it as leverage so you could have sex with another man.  If I had known that was your ulterior motive, I never would have agreed to it. What you did was dishonest and manipulative.""

Of course, she wasn't too happy to hear this.  There was much tears and anguish from her part, but she accepted it eventually.  I started getting texts the next day from her, she was apologising profusely, saying she was sorry, she didn't want to sleep with another man, she regrets suggesting the threesome, and she just wants to continue her relationship with me.

I said to her something about us being ""sexual incompatible"", but honestly I felt like I was just giving her a bullshit excuse. The real reason was that I didn't want a woman that so desperately wanted to have sex with another guy, that she would even manipulate me towards that goal.

I keep getting more texts from her and missed calls, angry ones, apologetic ones, crying ones, and furious ones.  Since she didn't seem to get the message that we're through, I'm just ignoring her now.  Honestly, I'm really happy with my decision, no regrets. I feel like I've let go of some negative baggage, and I'm already excited about moving on with my life and pursuing future relationships.

TLDR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?

So I had been meaning to post an update about this for a while but never got around to it, and then last night something really big happened and I think its really important that you guys keep in mind that this is all happening in my second language, nobody involved in the story speaks English (Except Sarah a little bit).

So where we left off with my last post, I had had a conversation with Sarah about Derek that made me feel better. Derek later reached out to me, apologized, said he had drunk too much on an empty stomach and that he was embarrassed about his actions. 

I'm sorry you guys, but I agreed to hang out with him again, this time just over coffee. Things were fine and he further integrated me into the neighborhood by introducing me to the people he knows and inviting me to join other neighbors for drinks and such. He opened up to me about a traumatic event that happened to him in his past and about his mental illness. He brought me around his family and his nieces who were all lovely. Other people seemed to adore him. I really liked all of this and we quickly fell into a romantic relationship. 

Derek seemed to be almost flaunting the relationship around the neighborhood. I had one other conversation with Sarah where she asked me some questions about how I felt about him. I explained that I liked him but felt confused and that he was moving quickly. She told me, in English so I know she was serious, ""Take your time."" soon after this Derek broke things off with me very suddenly, and rather forcefully. I found his sudden change of heart very confusing and upsetting. A week after he broke up with me I asked him to come over to my apartment to talk about what happened and we agreed to remain friends, since we'd have to see each other around the neighborhood. 

I spoke about all this with Sarah, who told me that she didn't know anything about it and said that she was sorry. About a week after I agreed to remain friends with Derek he invited me out for a drink, gave me a necklace, and we got a little bit intimate, but he clearly told me ""Do not talk about me at the bar."" which I found very strange. 

This is getting longer than I wanted it to be so I'm going to jump to last night. Sarah and the other woman who owns the cafe are a couple, they've been together for 10 years and they invited me to spend Christmas eve with them since they knew I would be alone. I brought up Derek, of course, and asked them why they thought that he wouldn't want me to talk about him in the Cafe. Silvia played dumb until we had some privacy and then she revealed to me that she and Derek had had a relationship while he was seeing me.

At first, he had lied to her and said that we were strictly platonic, but that lie quickly fell apart. Sarah said that she wanted to talk to me about it but never had the opportunity because we were always in the cafe. She apologized that some days she had acted cold towards me (which I hadn't noticed) and she said that after a few weeks she had insisted that Derek choose either her or me. Apparently, he chose her. Soon after that, she ended things with him completely. The next evening he invited me out for a drink to try to rekindle things

So Sarah apologized to me. She said she felt stupid and like a bad person, but that she had been feeling old and unattractive lately (she is 50). I told her that I wasn't upset with her at all, just shocked and that I was sorry I had been so oblivious to the real situation. 

So, I definitely didn't see that coming. I'm not going to confront Derek about this, I'm just going to let it go and move on. Sorry for acting like an idiot. I wish I could say I've learned something but I probably haven't.

Original post.


About 3 day's after my post I read all the comments and realized everyone was right. And I want to be 100% faithful to my wife and this woman is NOT worth losing my family.

Some posters said something may be missing from my marriage. and I thought about it and realized me and my wife don't spend that much time together.

So I talked to my wife about it I told her how I felt and what was on my mind and we had a heart to heart. We cried a little and I don't want to lose her we made a schedule and are going to work out date nights for us to spend more time together.

As for Talia.

Me and her met up and I told her the honest truth I'm married and I don't want to do something I'll regret forever. I told her my feelings were getting a little to inappropriate and that maybe we should not talk outside of work.

She agreed and told me she started feeling the same and that we should limit contact. She said it's for the best and that I'm a good man because most men would have just let it continue but I didn't.

So we ended our friendship.


In the mean time I'm going to focus on my family and my wife and distract myself from thinking of Talia. Looking back it wouldn't have been worth it because my wife has been with me through everything.

When I lost my job when my parents died when I needed surgery. She's had my children and sacrifices for them and takes care of them without asking for anything in return.

And I'm happy with her and I couldn't replicate all those memories with any woman. She's the only one for me and I realized and appreciate all the things she does for me and our family.

That's the update and hopefully I'll never have to return to this sub-reddit again.

I'm finding all this very overwhelming so I will keep it short.

They have been our shared friendship group since we got together 8 years ago. I've had a disability for about three years. 

I recently found out three members have tried to convince my fiance to leave me on multiple occasions, purely due to my disability. They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy. He assured them each time he is happy and it is his choice to stay with me. 

They are all acting as though it is normal that they would try to convince him to leave, and that I'm overreacting by being upset. They've also stated they wanted ""what was best for both of us"" which I think was pretty obviously not true.

I'm just trying to get some clarity here because I'm feeling very confused and worthless. I have myself given my fiance the option of leaving many times and said i wouldn't blame him, but he always said he wanted to stay.

Is their behaviour normal? Is it OK for me to be upset?

Thanks in advance

Tl;dr : group members have tried to convince my partner to leave me due to my disability. Is that normal, and is it OK for me to feel upset.

Edit: a lot of people seem to be interested in precisely what the disability is. As explained below it is rare enough that given the friends in question are redditors I think it would possibly stop the post being fully anonymous. To answer in depth questions: it is a physical disability, no it is not at all weight related, I am following all the medical guidelines possible regarding healing though not everything is known about this condition. Yes I am trying my best, no I am never abusive towards him, yes I am able to emotionally support him when he needs it. Yes he has to help me physically sometimes for example pushing my wheelchair and making the majority of meals. No it is not expected to get worse over time although nobody can know for sure. Yes he has to emotionally support me too when anxiety or grief about this condition get to me. Hopefully that now gives everyone enough information to go off.

Edit 2: thank you for all the lovely validating replies. It is nice to know not everyone thinks about disability in the way they do.

So Last Thursday Jim took me out for dinner. He came to pick me up and I was still super nervous, even though by that time I was pretty sure it was a date. He opened the door of the taxi for me, but I went to go around the other side, thinking he was just getting in the car! He looked really confused until I figured out that he was being a gentleman and we both ended up laughing about it. It kind of broke the ice as he seemed a little nervous too.

We went for cocktails, then for dinner. Despite my insistence, he paid for everything and it was just perfect. We were chatting for hours and before we knew it, they were closing up around us.

Jim walked me to my taxi and kissed me goodbye. My stomach flipped over and I felt like a teenager - I couldn't stop grinning on the way home and fell asleep with a stupid smile on my face.

The next morning, I woke to find a text from him telling me how much he'd enjoyed our date and that he'd like to see me again soon. I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-)

So I finally had enough. One Sunday a few weeks ago, my roommates left without warning while I had just settled in to get my homework done. The dog barked his head off for a good hour before I packed up my backpack and spent the rest of the day at Starbucks so I could concentrate. I called my mom and vented my frustration before cooling off and sending a well-thought out and vetted text message to let them know I was pretty upset about it, and that home has become a place of extra stress for me the last several months. I added that it isn't fair to the dog to be left so distraught all the time. The text was long, but rational, and I said that the dog needed to find a new home.

Fast forward three days when they finally decided to acknowledge me aside from little pleasantries in passing. They told me that the dog wasn't going anywhere, but that they would look into getting a dog sitter for the mornings they both left before I did. Ideal? Not really, but at that point I was ready to hear their options. It's only two days a week that he wakes me up before I need to be. They said it was a financial burden. Okay, I understand that... but having a special needs dog is a financial burden to begin with, and that should have been considered before even bringing him home in the first place.

Fast forward again almost a month to today. They have not found a dog sitter, and I'm not even sure they have even looked. With the end of the semester approaching, they know that my schedule will be changing very soon, and I'll likely be gone on the same days as my classmate, eliminating the mornings in which I'll be woken up by his barking. But now they've escaped taking any responsibility or showing any remorse for what a shit situation this is. On top of that, they have installed a nanny cam in the living room so that both of them can watch the dog and talk to him from their phones while they are away. I get the sentiment, but also I live in this house too. At any point while they are watching the dog, I could be spied upon also, and that's really discomforting. 

To top it off, I woke up this morning to his barking, and at this point I need to be up and moving anyway. They've started leaving pee pads out for him to use during the day while they're gone, and at 7 AM, mere minutes after everyone has left for the day, he's left a nice watery pile of shit on one of them and peed on the other. I don't want to clean these up, nor do I want to leave them in the house all day for my cat to traipse through or even eat (I hope to god that isn't a thing she does but who knows). This is not my responsibility, and now my home is going to smell like shit all day. And now that both pads are soiled, is he going to decide he won't use them anymore and eliminate on the floor? He's been having some bowel trouble lately, are people going to come home to diarrhea? I'm about to be gone from 9-6, so luckily someone will be home before me to find it, but the thought grosses me out. 

Anyway. I faced my fears of confrontation, only to be passively disrespected. At this point I'm looking at ways to get out of this lease and move out with another classmate in July, with the stipulation that we won't have dogs and any significant others can visit but won't be living with us. I'm completely at my wit's end. Still.

-------
**TL;DR; : Calmly and politely confronted the roommates about the dog, they decided to do nothing.**

EDIT: thank you all for your advice. I?ve emailed my landlord about my options for moving out, and he?s stated that I can sublease my room. 

I?m going to call a group meeting tonight with the other girls and reiterate my concerns, express the new concerns about his incontinence and potential damage to the floors, and explain that I?m looking at moving out. I?ll also explain that they need to come clean to management about the dog, or that they can move out to a pet friendly place, and that if they don?t, I will, since I should not be held at all responsible for violating the terms of the lease.

EDIT 2: I super appreciate everyone who?s called me spineless. Thanks y?all. It?s something I?m incredibly self aware of and working on. Yeah, I?ve been diagnosed with anxiety, cool of y?all for calling that out too. 

As far as not telling the landlord about the dog yet, I?m not in a place where I?m ready to risk throwing myself under the bus as well. Should I have put my foot down in the beginning that the dog couldn?t come? Absolutely. Hindsight is 20/20. Should I have been more firm when they made literally no changes after the first conversation? Absolutely. Like I said, I?m working on it. 

Much appreciation for those who sent words of encouragement, reminded me to focus on the fact that my feelings are valid and worth being heard as well. I can?t let people walk all over me, especially in the variety of ways that they have.

I'll begin with the easy part. A quick update

I drove to my ex's parents' house on Tuesday and took her the rest of her stuff.  It started out bumpy because her dad met me on the driveway and argued with me about what he sees as my sister being a spoiled brat and turning me against his daughter.  As soon as I started losing it and raising my voice my ex ran out and sent him inside the house.

I told her we're over and I'm moving on.  She made some empty threats but I just told her to do what she has to do and walked away.  That night I took the suggestion repeated here to take my sister  for ice cream and apologize.  She chose Frugos instead (as usual) so we went there and I explained how sorry I was and that I will be better.  I told her that I totally believed her.  She was happy to hear everything I had to say.  It makes a huge difference to a child when you give a sincere apology I could tell.  She even texted a couple of her friends to gloat that my ex was gone.

Okay now the hard part.

On Wednesday I took her to the park to kick the soccer ball around and to have an overdue talk with her.  I asked her about my ex and she told me that she was mistreated by her more than I knew about.   She had a lot to say about her time at mom's house during the time when I was away.  I didn't know how hard it was for her when I enlisted and left.  That was hard to hear.  It was kind of a move to get myself out of a situation with zero thought to leaving her behind.  The short version is that we have all failed her badly.  She didn't say it but just everything she has to say about how things have gone down around her made it clear.

When I was first discharged I got good job working for the city.  But I was drinking every weekend and my house was the hang out spot for my friends and that's how I met my ex.  I was even drinking on a lot of week nights.  I didn't immediately take my sister with me even though I knew about how my mom was living.  My wake up call was when my sister called me because the cops were there looking for mom to question her, and her boyfriend.  That was when I finally cleaned up, rented a house close to my sister's school and brought her to live with me.

She doesn't remember that I waited so long to bring her with me.  She remembers it as if I acted quickly which is totally false and makes me look way better than I was.  It was really shocking and brutal to hear things from her perspective.  She has been through more than I can have imagined.  She is a very strong person.

So definitely no more girlfriends for me for a long time.  That was an emotionally expensive lesson to learn with everything that my sister had to go through while I was being blind and dumb.  I'm going to wait and literally become a monk until she is in college.  She gets so many straight A's with some B's here and there.  She has a bright future.  

EDIT:  I'm sure I'll date someday again.  Right now I'm not ready, not even close.  I might be a few months away from changing my mind but a couple of years is more likely.

I told her that I still saw her as my best friend, no matter what her sexuality was. I said I loved her, but only as a sister. I apologized for misleading her into thinking I had romantic feelings for her. My friend thanked me for being supportive of her coming out of the closet. She said I was the first one she told about her sexuality. I told her I was honoured that she came out to me first, and that it really meant a lot for our friendship. She told me the things we did together didn?t cause her to think that I had feelings for her, and that really close girl friends do stuff like that with each other all the time. Hearing her say that relieved a lot of guilt from me.

My friend was okay with me not liking her in the same way, and that she expected it. She explained to me that our friendship was one of a kind, and that she wouldn?t let anything get in the way of that. I told her if she needed time away from me that I'd be completely fine with it, but she said she was okay and that she?d already dealt with her feelings for me before telling me.

Our friendship has not changed. She?s still the same person that I?ve known since grade 2. I don?t feel at all awkward being around her knowing that she?s a lesbian. She said coming out to me made her feel a sense of freedom, she told me it was hard to keep such a big lie from me when we tell each other everything.

We?ve been through so much together. This is another bump in our journey that we?ll overcome. In the end, I feel like her coming out to me has brought us closer together. I?ll always be her best friend no matter what, and I?ll be fully supporting her when she starts telling everyone about her sexuality.

I filed for divorce after a few conversations with my husband.  He blames J for our divorce and became very threatening.  At one point he said he would turn walk away from me and our two kids if I didn't stop the divorce process.  I called his bluff and told him ""good, go, we would be better off.""  In my state it takes six months to finalize divorce with children involved.  I have sole custody and he never filed for joint custody which is good.

Now on to J.  There's so much but I'll try to be brief.  He's in therapy and lives with my parents.  He's sticking it out with school even though he has anxiety and depression.  He's fighting really hard to heal.  Sometimes he has setbacks and is just like a broken down little boy.  He has a very strong will and spirit and sometimes I wonder how far he would have gone in life even now at 19 if the animals hadn't totally broken him.

His siblings and mom still try to contact him and guilt him for not staying with his mom to ""take care of her as she ages.""  They all agreed that J's life would be to be the mother's caretaker as they all go on have live their own as they wish.  He actually feels guilty about not fulfilling that shockingly.  He has a long way to go before he realizes that his life is his to do as he wishes.  They don't have his phone number anymore but they email him.  My dad got him a new phone cause his mom would call him and berate him and guilt him.  It seemed like every conversation with her set him back two steps.  She still knows how to crush him sadly.  I wish she didn't have that power over him.  I've never wished a death penalty on somebody like I do on her.

He's dating a girl and I'm scared she might hurt him (break his heart) but my dad is more encouraging of that and has to remind me to not over protect him.  J has become very close with my mom.  He drives her grocery shopping and enjoys doing that stuff with her.  My dad taught him how to drive in like one week.  He is about to go take his driving test for his DL, he's still on a learner's permit.

There are a lot of positive things going on but progress is very slow and sometimes it's like watching a clock.  It just seems like he's standing still in terms of anxiety and depression.  I can't say too much about all that's going on but I can say that my parents have an attorney and are going through the adoption process.  

I wanted this to be a more upbeat and positive update but honestly J struggles a lot.  Law enforcement is now involved because some of the physical abuse is more recent than I thought, just from his mom.  He has a few scars and he has broken bones that never healed properly cause he never got medical attention.  Protection orders are likely to be granted.  If they are, then according to the investigators charges will almost be inevitable.  That part of it I can't say much about but can say that J is willing to go forward with that process for now under the guidance of his therapist.  But we have been warned that he may choose to back off later.  Though one cop said there is a point of no return for the DA even without J's cooperation.

Thank you for the wonderful messages of support, advice, and even some of the harsher reality checks.

I realized really quickly that the issue wasn't guilt about being a SAHM. It was that I hadn't been communicating well about money.

I approached her when all of the kids were asleep/busy/etc. It wasn't the type of discussion that I wanted to get interrupted. I, as directly as I could, told her about my concerns and worries about everything with money, her feeling afraid, what everything looked like from my side and apologized that I hadn't been direct enough in telling her.

She admitted that it did bother her that she didn't know how much I was making which left her blind as to what was okay/what wasn't. She also shared with me that when we were at a small get together for my family that a family member of mine (cousin, not parents or siblings) made a few snarky comments about how one of her friends was a SAHM and then her husband left her with nothing, got bitter about it, what does she do all day, yada yada. A bunch of bullshit. I guess she had also made a few comments about how a lot of men got their wife expensive gifts when they were cheating.

This cousin is nothing but a raging mess who can't keep a friend or a boyfriend around for more than 3 weeks at a time. So she can go fuck herself. I don't have a big connection to her anyway. So its not like it'll cause a bunch of drama for me to block her everywhere. So we did that.

I offered to let her go through my computer/phone/etc. I didn't know what else to do there to prove that I'm not cheating. Keep in mind \- she was NOT aggressively insisting it. She didn't really, actually, truly think I was cheating. The comments just made her insecure because she (her words) has baby weight to lose. My wife assured me that she didn't want to go through any of my stuff and that she trusts me. I'm still slightly fuming about any family causing drama, but thankfully I only have to see her once every few years.

I figured (after I thought about it) that a serious family discussion didn't need to happen in a FA's office. At least not immediately. I did re\-give her his number and she can go see him whenever she wants if she needs assurance or something else. We sat down and talked about my income each year, how much of that was going into what, and how much was left over for ""fun"" money. Guilt started bubbling and she felt bad which is when I did whip out the prices of nannies, cleaning ladies, etc. Thanks for that suggestion. My wife (as precious as she is) made me cut down the maids portion in half because we do still have someone come in sometimes. Either way \- it was still a large amount.

We talked for a few hours and I asked her if she wanted to see the FA. So we have that scheduled to go there soon.

It was a long discussion that got interrupted despite our best efforts. I asked if she wanted to go therapy and she said yes. So she made me take off how much it would be to get someone to regularly come in each week off of the babysitting column of my ""this is how much money you save us"" list. So shes going to start therapy in 2 weeks.

I love my wife. We talked for a long time about retirement, the kids future, money in general, how she felt about it, etc.

Sorry I don't have any super exciting news or drama to report. I just wanted to tell anyone (who was curious) how it went.

I know we probably still have some communication issues to work through. Her making me cut down and edit the ""list of services"" shows me that she still does have some old issues surrounding money (which she did admit to). But as long as we're going forward we'll get there.

P.S She did go and buy her regular non\-cheap skincare stuff.

TL;DR We had a really long talk about everything and how we would handle money going from then. A cousin had made her even more insecure that I was buying her nice things cause I was cheating (but she was already nervous before that). We talked about money and shes going to go therapy to work through issues rooting back to taking care of everyone else for years.

- ""Your mom is really helping you out, so you should extend the same hand to me. You should sacrifice for family."" 

- ""We shared a room before.""

I ended up simply telling her--

""My mom has asked me to pay her back for the apartment when I have the chance. I do not want to share a room with you and I do not feel we are close at all. On top of that, your mom ruined my parents' relationship, so I am not going to do her any favors.""

A bit later, I got a Claudette flavored e-mail from my father.

I replied telling them no. 

I got a text from Claudette telling me to lose her number and that I was blocked.

So, Brit has celiac disease along with alot of allergies and dietary restrictions. I know all her allergies, and the PDF of her allergies from her allergist spans about 5 pages. I even have a ""what to do"" PDF on my phone in case she goes into anaphylaxis. She even has asthma and a deviated septum so she has issues with breathing.

My mom brings up that I've been missing dinners and suggests that I bring Brit to dinner one day so she can meet the family and catch up with me. I tell my mom about ALL her allergies, I even made suggestions on what she could cook for her. Basically told her, no to gluten, dairy, all kinds of peanuts, and alot of fruits. No one in my family has any allergies to anything but she said she'll take care of it for Brit and look up some recipes I suggested. 

Eating out and making dinner for Brit is pretty tricky but I've assured her that she can enjoy all the food my mom is preparing. We get to my parents place and everyone's on the patio waiting for us. Brit has a place card next to my mom with a couple of burger buns and fries already in front of it so we assumed they're gluten free and specially made for her, that my mom didn't want to get them mixed up with everyone else's food. Brit had one bite before she looked at me in horror, and asked me to inject her with her epipen. 

We're at the hospital and Brit doesn't even want me in the room because her symptoms included diarrhea and she's very self conscious about her hives. My dad texted me apologizing for my mom saying ""Sorry, she didn't realize the fries were cooked in peanut oil before they were packaged. She didn't know Brit was celiac -- you said no gluten, and who has THAT many allergies? Mom thought she was just very high maintenance."" 

The last time Brit had an allergic reaction, it gave her such a horrible asthma attack she was hospitalized for 7 days. She's missing days of work by being in the hospital for observation. How do I let my mom know that this is unacceptable? Brit could've died so I'm not taking this shit lightly.

Looking back I was probably overreacting some because it was so personal to me.

Before I do the update ? a lot of people mentioned that they weren?t aware of how Tourette?s can manifest itself. I also got some PMs about it, so here is just a bit more information. Basically to be ?qualified? for Tourette?s, you have to have multiple tics, both motor AND vocal. Funnily enough, although I had tics since around middle school, I only learned about Tourette?s through watching a South Park episode about it in my first year of college. So if you are interested in learning more (they give a great overview of the disorder) and also laughing a lot, I recommend you watch S11E08 of South Park, ?Le Petit Tourette?.

So on to the update ? I had my interview on Tuesday when I made my post. On Friday afternoon, I got a call from HR; she asked me how the interview went. I wondered if something had been mentioned, so I said it went well except for this one awkward exchange, and I explained briefly what happened. She said she was sorry to hear abut the unpleasantness, but she was calling to let me know that every person I had met with had great things to say about me, and they unanimously voted to give me an offer.

SO I got the job! It was a good offer with nice benefits. It?s not my dream job, though, and I was actually in the later stages with another position that I really, really wanted. I asked them if I could have a week to respond; they said yes.

Yesterday, I got a call from this second company, and they gave me an offer too. The offer was a ton more money than the first one, like over 30% more, it?s the exact position I have been looking for for months, and it?s right by the beach! I of course accepted. I am ecstatic and will find a new apartment and start the new job in June, which is after my May wedding :)

Thank you again for your kind words. I appreciate it. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about Tourette?s!

First off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread. 

I never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue.

Anyway.

I went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter. 

He was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great. 

Apparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect! 

Yeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it! 

I waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely. 

We were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift.

While he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future. 

The language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)   

So that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife!

God, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy! 

To all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks! 

**tl;dr: I proposed, he proposed back, we both said yes! He declined my offer of fully paid tuition fees for studying at university and the language course idea, and said he would much rather spend time with me abroad, just the two of us!

I wanted to post an update because it's nice reading positive outcomes on here. I got a lot of responses and it really helped me better understand what he was going thru. We were finally able to have a good talk about it. He told me what a lot of you said. That truck was his identity and part of who he was. 

I told him I knew he didn't want that car he bought and he told me I was right. We talked more an enventually figured out something that would work. He sold the car he had and we agreed he could just use mine. Our schedule works out to where he could take me to work and pick me up on time. It wasn't a big hassle and I was going on maternity leave soon anyways. He found a totaled truck for sale and the engine was still in good condition. It was the engine he wanted. He bought the truck for what was supposedly a really good deal and him and a couple friends ripped everything out of it that he needed and got rid of the body. The engine is in our garage now. It took him a couple weeks but he found a truck to put the engine into and him and a friend are going to pick it up this weekend.

First of all I want to say thank you to everyone who contributed to my last post. I never expected it to blow up the way it did and get that many replies. After a while the number of responses got overwhelming and I was unable to reply to many of the later posts and/or questions. 

I do wanna clarify a few things which kept coming up in the last post. This situation for me has absolutely nothing to do with ""gender expectations"" or anything like that, that's just not who I am. I suppose I should have expected that response from this sub given so many of the posts are about cheating, abusive partners or people confused with gender stereotypes etc. 

With that out of the way I also should have clarified in my OP that I am not a big gift receiver in general. I feel uncomfortable even when my parents, friends or other family members splurge on me. I also want to point out that people kept on bringing up scaling of money in that $200 for me has the same value that 5k has for her. Yes, that's fine in theory but it can still be hard to comprehend in real life when I have never had that kind of money splurged on me or lived such a high class lifestyle. It's easier said than done when people were urging me to accept her proposal with grace. 

Anyway, here goes the actual update:
----------------------------------------------------------
Before posting my last post I had already decided that I was going to turn her down and I wanted to get advice on how to politely turn her down. After listening to the good people of this sub I opened my mind a little and decided to have a talk with her about our relationship, her money, and our finances moving forward with an open mind. 

She came over last night after work and we talked about her proposal. I told her I was incredibly thankful for her offer but in all honestly it did make me uncomfortable. I explained to her that it was because of my middle class background and the fact that I am not a big gift receiver in general. She cut me off right then and there and said she was sorry if she felt me uncomfortable and she was only coming from a good place. She revealed to me that growing up even she had feelings similar to mine because she viewed everything as her ""family's money"" and only after she matured later on in life did she start to not feel bad about her wealth and privilege, and simply starting enjoying it for what it is. She told me she has a standing offer from her father to work a cushy job in the family business but she still does understand the value of money and that's why she still works on her own. We then talked about her family's wealth and the impact it had on her past relationships. She told me that usually she's never offered to do something this big for anyone else but she only offered this because she really trusts me, respects me and has fallen for me hard. She mentioned that in her last relationship she kept everything 50-50 because she wasn't sure about the guy and their relationship got very toxic by the end because he simply expected her to pay for everything. She said she loves my ambition and wants me to  keep progressing in my career. 

All that being said, I asked her what it would mean for our relationship going forward if I accepted. We both decided that nothing changes, we keep on splitting it 50-50 as we have so far. She joked that she wouldn't let me off the hook for future dates/expenses this easily lol. For any future trips/activities we decided that we won't always go for the most expensive options or the most budget friendly ones and try to find more of a middle ground. 

Ultimately she insisted that because she had already made the offer I had to accept. I did with the compromise being that once we are there we are going to split everything else 50-50, she will let me treat her a few times, and we won't be splurging the way she is used to on vacations. 

I am really thankful that his happened and we both feel closer than ever. She will be coming over on Friday to spend the weekend with me and plan/book this trip. I couldn't be happier right now.

I accepted her offer and we both feel a lot closer.** ",1469662021.0,Update: My (29M) very rich GF (25F) of 8 months wants to pay for an expensive vacation for the both of us.

Hi all,

Thought I would update you on what happened since my last post. And I want to thank everyone again for all the advice, it really helped me make a decision.

So, I decided to email him back, to try and find out why he was coming back now, after all these years, out of nowhere. And oh boy, am I glad for not having jumped all in...

Instead of telling you guys what happened, I think simply translating the emails (with all names redacted of course) will make it much easier to follow. So here we go.

Here's the email I sent him, in response to his first messages to try and reconnect. Not a very nice email, I know, but I wanted to see if he had really changed and if he was actually ready to apologize or at least recognize what he'd done wrong.

- - - - 

Hi,

Email not easy to read (nor write). Just trying to be honest here.

I don?t have an answer to give you yet, I?m thinking about it, I can?t get past 13 years and tell myself ?let?s forget everything and start from scratch? in 2 days.?I need to think, given the situation.

But I do have a question for you?? why now?? Your answer won?t influence my decision, I just need to understand. My first reaction when reading your emails was ""is he dying ?"". Try to understand, 13 years with no contact and I receive this on a Monday morning, out of the blue, it brings up a lot of questions in my head.

And it?s not like nothing?s happened in these 13 years. Maybe it would be easier if that were the case (or maybe not, I don?t know).

The last I heard anything about you, via other people, was 2 years ago when gran was ill. 2 years. That?s not long ago, and I?m still recovering from that period. The last 2 years may have been the most difficult years of my life. 2 years of depression, thinking about gran every single day, being mad at you for not contacting me, hating you for not even telling me when the funerals were gonna take place, and because of all this, I won?t ever be able to get closure. And yes I also have some blame in there, don?t think I haven?t been mad at myself during the last 2 years as well. I will be mad at myself, and at you, probably my whole life, this story is not something I will ever be able to just forget.

Trying to reconnect at that time, 2 years ago, might have seemed more logical to me. When a family goes through this kind of thing, with a family member very sick, they have to get closer to each other, around that family member.?At least, that?s what I thought.?But instead, I had people telling me you got angry at them for just letting me know gran was sick. Like I didn?t have the right to know about it?? At that time, it seemed very clear to me that I wasn?t part of your family at all, and that you wanted me to stay as far away as possible.?I felt your hatred, which I never managed to understand.

Whatever happened between you and me, I?d always hoped, until then, that if whatever happened for gran, I would receive a quick email, or a message on FB, anything, just to let me know what was going on.?But no.?So I?ve had to try and grieve gran without being able to say goodbye, and I?ve had to accept the fact that my dad wanted nothing to do with me.?It?s far from easy, hence 2 years of depression.

All the arguments around money, the stories between you and mom, or even the stories between us and [new wife], all of that is very old for me. So old that today, I can?t remember everything that has happened. So it could be easy to forget about these, if there was all there is to it. But what happened with gran is something I am still feeling today and is much harder to get past.

So yes, my question is, why now and not 2 years ago???I will wait for your answer.

I know reading this email can?t be easy, as I said before, it was far from easy to write as well. But if you truly want to reconnect, on my end I need to understand before I make any kind of decision.?

- - -

He then replied, and his email made me the angriest I had ever been before. Since my following reply includes his whole email (I replied inline), I'll just paste my reply and you'll have his email at the same time. Here goes.

- - -

HIM: Ok, let?s be honest and speak freely : let?s talk about gran, poor her, my she rest in peace. I think your relationship with her was more than occasional and that at one point, she got tired only of only being contacted for your birthday,

ME: >> So already here, no. Just, no. My relationship with gran was very good at the time. I was at Uni and I would go spend the weekend at her place very often. We would play Yams, I would make pizzas, etc. I have lots of good memories of that period. So, no.

HIM: that?s why the last years of her life she had cut contact with you (yeaah, still a money argument !).

ME: >> And no again. I remember perfectly the last conversation I?d had with her. I was calling her to tell her I just passed my License Degree. And she was mad after you told her that we had apparently ?stolen your money?. And she just hung up. So no, I am not to blame here. You?ve taken enough from me, I won?t let you tarnish my memories of her.
And what you probably don?t know, is that she asked for my forgiveness, when I went to see her 2 years ago. She knew perfectly what happened, and knew I wasn?t to blame in the story. So, just, no. When I went to see her at Uni, I would always try to avoid talking about my relationship with her, to try not to make her sadder that she already was. While on your side, you decided to bury me and break my relationship with her. So if someone is to blame here, that?s you, certainly not me. MY fault, was to accept it without saying anything, and not trying to reconnect after a while. And yes, I blame myself for that. But for everything else, you?re gonna have to wake up at some point and accept the consequenses of your actions.

HIM: By the way, quickly on the side, not having any contact with me, ok, but why did you cut ties with [new kids], they didn?t have anything to do with the situation, [new wife] has always felt really affected about this.

ME: >> I wasn't against them. But you lived together. If they?d tried to contact me, I wouldn?t have said no, far from it. But here again, you?re putting all the blame on me, that?s quite easy.

HIM: Getting back to gran, indeed, I didn?t warn you when she got sick, nor when she died, because, and I?ll be perfect honest here, I imagined you coming out of nowhere, without warning anyone, without having taken any news from her for years, and I imagined you coming to do the inventory.

ME: >> Funny, that?s EXACTLY what I told [gran?s best friend] at the time. It?s crazy how you?re turning the situation around to your advantage. Let?s be clear, right now. I DON?T GIVE A CRAP about your money. And when I heard about gran, no, I wasn?t the devil you created in your head, I just wanted to see her, for me, and for her. NO SHITS GIVEN about the f***ing inventory. If that was what I cared about, no need to go see her, I could have just found you or taken a lawyer. 

HIM: It?s because you cut ties with gran that I didn?t want you there and that I didn?t try to reconnect back then. We were very shocked at the time, with gran?s best friend, about the way you acted. So no, it was absolutely not a question for me to try and reconnect with you then.

ME: >> The way I acted. Nobody thought that maybe, just maybe, I needed a moment to process what was going on? Years with no news, and the whole situation gets thrown at me out of nowhere, with no warning. When I received the FB message, 2 days later I was on a plane to go see her. Afterwards yes, I took too long to call her again when I got back home. And yes, I blame myself for it. But here again, it?s very easy to paint me as a devil, without having even tried to understand what was going on in my head.

HIM: To answer your question, ? why now ?, well I?m asking myself the same. It?s been weeks, months that I?m thinking about it and I?m trying to let my heart speak instead of my brain.

ME: >> Your heart ? Seriously ? I don?t see anything in this email that shows me you even have one.

HIM: And at the same time, if I didn?t do this, would you have done it ? I?ve gone through my past, persuaded myself that I needed to stop banging on about my resentment towards you which also had consequences on your sister who didn?t do anything.

ME: >> Here congratulations, this is the best I?ve heard all year. So you?re basically trying the blame the fact that YOU cut ties with her, on me. I must be dreaming. Nobody ever prevented you from taking her on weekends or during holidays, when I decided to stop coming. By the way, legally, you HAD to continue seeing her. But no, you?re right, that must be on me again !

HIM: It?s not only during ? grand happenings ? that you?re supposed to get news from your family or try to reconnect. By the way, I am to blame regarding your sister, for not continuing to reply to her messages since 2008. 

ME: >> Oh, wow, you?re actually accepting part of the blame. It?s gonna snow.

So, to recap your email :

? You have absolutely not changed one bit. You stay the manipulator you were 10 years ago.

? You are a First Class mythomaniac. You?ve invented a diabolical version of me, your daughter, and truly believe your own lies.

? Obviously, you?re pushing all the blame onto me (why not, after all, I am a devil who wants to take all of your money).

? And, of course, you?re not apologising for anything.

So my answer is an absolute no. I officially do not want anything to do with you anymore. If at your age, you still don?t realise that the life you invented for yourself is a huge mass of lies, sad for you, but on my end I will continue living, knowing you once and for all out of my life. I managed the last 10 years, I will live even better now that this whole thing is finally over. So, maybe, thank you! Thanks for proving to me that I was right about you, and that I shouldn?t spend even 1 more second thinking about you. My goal with yesterday?s email was to see if you had changed, I have my answer.

Don?t even try to reply to this email. I am blocking you, and if that doesn?t work, I will simply delete every single of your messages when they come in, without reading them. I won?t give you the chance to explain yourself, you just did, everything is clear as day on my end now.

I?m going to bring back a sentence you sent me years ago, when I had tried to reconnect. You said ?if for you, I don?t have a wife, then I don?t have daughters anymore.?. Well today, I am telling you : if you don?t have a daughter, then I don?t have a father anymore.

Do not EVER try to contact me again. I hope that is clear. Not tomorrow, not a year from now, not even on your deathbed. For me, you died today.

- - -

And there we go! Yes, I know, I've been downright nasty. But honestly, I think I needed to get it all out. After reading his email, I felt like I was going to burst out in flames, he reaaaaally pissed me off.

And I feel so much better now. It's like, maybe I needed to push all my anger out, to feel 'free' in a way. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel so much lighter now, I haven't felt like this for years.

Feel free to comment of course and let me know your thoughts on the email exchange. And again, thank you all so much for the support. I wouldn't have managed to do this without you guys.

**tl:dr** of original: fellow student often harasses young female students and was applying for a job that would put him in a position of authority over exactly those students he targets. I felt I needed to do something to prevent this from happening. 

My special thanks go out to /u/time_keepsonslipping and /u/Pillbot10011 who had a very, *very* good discussion on sexual harassment in academia and how this was quite a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. However, they did help me see that I actually had a solution that was staring me right in the face. 

I went to my mentor, a male professor who's high up the management ladder and actually even responsible for HR for the part of the organization that concerns this story. (Like I said, the solution was *really* staring me right in the face.) I trust this man and I knew he would believe me and follow up on my worries without a second thought. 

I wasn't wrong. I went to see him and simply told him something was worrying me deeply and I needed some advice, after which I told him the story. Now, you should know, this man is a very calm and funny guy. This was the first time since I've known him to find him go quiet and to see anger build up in his eyes. 

He asked me for the name of this person and I told him who it was. Then he told me he will go to HR straight away to ask about the status of his application, and if needed would use his executive position to veto the application. 

He came to see me the next day to tell me the department had already turned down the guy based on his qualifications, so in the end, I was worried for nothing. **However**, we started talking about the subject of (sexual) harassment students may face and how they feel rather helpless because they don't really have anyone to turn to and the system actually discourages students from speak up about it.

Turns out this professor has been very, *very* active in trying to implement integrity and equal opportunity policy on a university wide level, but this was only focused on staff, not students. He took it upon him personally to see policy will be revisited on a university level to also include protection for students, not just staff and that he would use my example as the reason why we need to do this as a university. He also told me that in terms of short term action he would personally go to each department head that falls under his jurisdiction to discuss this matter.

When I spoke to him again some time later, he told me the department heads weren't really open to even acknowledge the problem (surprise, surprise) let alone do something about it. But he's not the kind of man to take no for an answer, so he's planning to go over their heads and develop some management tools for the whole organizational unit that he hopes will also affect the individual departments. 

In the end, I am really glad I took action. Even though in the end, action wasn't needed to prevent the thing I was worried about, I think me speaking up to my mentor has triggered some processes on different levels in the organization that will hopefully lead to some change. I know from experience that this is a very slow process, and I won't notice much change before I'll leave my university, but still, a start was made. If anything, it will lead to more awareness of this issue on different managerial levels. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out. 

**tl:dr** - Had a chat with a professor I know high up the ladder in management. Turned out, fellow student wouldn't have gotten the job anyways. However, my chat with that professor triggered - I hope - positive action on a broader, university wide level that will hopefully lead to some positive change in the years to come.

183,sadwifeconfusion,Relationships,3tbtre,3419,"Throwaway because the wife knows my main. Sorry in advance for this rambling mess.

Since my wife and I got married three years ago, things have been?off. I know that people grow and change with time, but around our wedding, my wife changed drastically. She bleached her dark brown hair blonde right before the ceremony, and I honestly thought I was in the wrong church for a split second when she came down the aisle. We moved into our house right after the honeymoon, and she went into full domestic mode. We?d shared cleaning duties before, but once we moved into the house, she became INSISTENT on doing everything before I could even get to it. Since this is our first house, I thought it was some kind of homeowner nesting thing, but it never stopped.
Her hair color is none of my business and I think most people would be happy not to have to clean, so I honestly didn?t really think much of either of those things at the time. The big thing has always been how closed off she got after the wedding. When we were dating, she?d tell me long rambling stories about her feelings and rant to me when she was upset and all that, and I liked hearing about what was going on inside her head. After the wedding, that stopped pretty abruptly. If I ask her how her day is, she will only ever tell me that it was ?fine!? or ?super!? She doesn?t talk to me about her feelings anymore, ever, even when I explicitly ask ?how do you feel about x?? She also stopped telling me about anything important that happened to her. About a year after we got married, her grandfather died. Did she tell me she?d lost her grandfather? No. She told me that she had to go to a conference for work on the other side of the country, which I thought nothing of. On the second day she was gone, her older brother texted me to tell me that my in-laws had really missed seeing me at the funeral. When I called her to ask why in the ever loving hell she didn?t tell me, and then LIED about it, all she would say was ?I didn?t want to trouble you. You have a lot on your plate?. After that, she went on a couple of ?spontaneous family trips?. She?s really, REALLY close to her family, so the first time she said she was going camping with her brother at their alma mater, I didn?t think a lot of it other than to be slightly disappointed and confused that I wasn?t invited, because her brother?s cool and the three of us go camping together a lot. But the second time, I started hearing alarm bells. 

I?d like to say I?m a more secure man, reddit, but after the second ?spontaneous family trip?, my wheels started spinning and I started to think that maybe she was cheating. This was a weird insecurity in the back of my mind for a while, since she wasn?t showing any other big signs of cheating (she wasn?t guarded about her phone and hadn?t changed her routine/appearance). A few weeks ago, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon about it until I asked her how many weeks along she was, and she nonchalantly said ?about 12 or 13?. She?d been pregnant for like three months before she even bothered to tell me! She?s not really showing at all, and she doesn?t usually drink, so I had been completely in the fucking dark. I honestly hadn?t even suspected. 

That was kind of it for me. I was sure she was cheating, and that it wasn?t my kid. I thought there was no possible way that a woman would keep her pregnancy a secret from HER HUSBAND for three months. So I snooped. Yes, I know I was wrong, but I wanted proof that she?d been having an affair before I moved out. One of my best buddies from college is a divorce attorney, and when I asked him what I should do, he sent me the info for a key logger. I installed it on my wife?s laptop and was prepared for the worst. Now, I feel like what I found is somehow worse than her cheating. I didn?t find any steamy messages, but I found out that she keeps a diary in a word document that she writes in every day. I know I should have just stopped once I knew she wasn?t cheating, but once I saw my name in her diary, I couldn?t stop. I read all of it. All seven separate documents, going back to way before we?d even met.  

Turns out she?s not cheating. She?s depressed as fuck, hates herself, and has absolutely no trust in me. All of the stuff I?d been confused and bothered by has some kind of sad, self-loathing explanation. She hates having blond hair, but she writes ?I know he?d divorce me if I went back to being a brunette, because wives are supposed to be blond? almost every week. The ?wives are supposed to be? thing is tangled up in everything. She thinks wives are supposed to be quiet, which is why she doesn?t talk to me anymore. She thinks wives are supposed to ?make things easier for their husbands, not harder?, which is why she didn?t tell me when her grandfather died. It just goes on and on and on. She didn?t tell me when she got a huge promotion and a raise because ?he?d leave me in a heartbeat if he knew I made more money than he does. Men can?t handle that?. It hurt to know that she thinks of me as some kind of one-dimensional 1950?s husband, and I?ve been wracking my brain to think of anything I could have done to make her think this way. 

What I can?t handle is that she?d lied about the big stuff. I honestly don?t know if I can forgive her for not telling me about the miscarriages. The ?spontaneous family trips? were actually her miscarrying two of our children, one at five weeks, the other at about 10. She went and stayed with her parents while she was recuperating, and her brother and sister came to support her. But not me. I didn?t get to be there for her, because she thinks I would leave her immediately if I knew that she?d ?killed? our children. She?s convinced that she caused both miscarriages because she smoked pot for a long time before we got married. For what it?s worth, it sounds like her family tried both times to get her to tell me, but she wouldn?t. She finally told me about this pregnancy because her parents threatened to tell me she didn?t. 

I?m just absolutely fucking dumbfounded. I don?t even know what to think right now. I?m just so baffled because everything she says about me in her diary is insanely nice. She goes on for pages and pages about how much she loves me and how she thinks I?m her soul mate and how she would do anything for me. I just can?t understand why she thinks that I would leave her. Knowing that she?s spent the last three years walking on eggshells around me, convinced that I would leave her at the drop of a hat is just so?confusing and awful. I feel like our marriage is some kind of lie. The woman I thought was self-confident and ready to take on the world is actually full of self-loathing and really, really, REALLY depressed. I don?t know her at all. She?s been suffering silently with depression long before we met. She has no faith in me, no trust. She thinks that every hug and kiss I give her and every ?I love you? I say is a lie. 

I just don?t know what to do. She obviously needs serious help, but I don?t know how to get it for her. I can?t tell her that I read her diary. If she has zero trust in me now, I can?t even imagine what she?d think if she knew if I read six years worth of her private thoughts. I feel like I need to get my in-laws on board somehow, but I don?t know what to say to them. I know I can?t ignore this, but I feel like any move is the wrong move. What do I do??

Tl;dr: thought wife was cheating so I snooped and read her diary. She's actually insanely depressed, has secretly miscarried two of our children, and doesn't trust me one iota. How do I get her help without making things worse?

Edit: after I posted this I realized I'd kind of omitted the deal with the key logger. It's worse than it sounds, honestly. After it showed me what she'd written that day I went onto her computer while she was sleeping and opened up Word. I saw that she had several documents called ""diary year x"" so I downloaded them all onto a flash drive and read them at work.

I'd like to say a massive thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to my post! I was over the moon with how many people replied. The advice I received was very insightful and useful. I used bits of everyone's answers to compose a letter to my sister before speaking to her on the phone. The letter consisted of sentiments of love and understanding, but also emphasised how her behavior has to stop, and that she needs to seek DBT therapy. I also set very specific boundaries in place and asked her to agree to them. I gave her a heads up via Whatsapp that the email had been sent to to ask her to read it and think on it before we spoke.

Her reaction was very positive -

""I just want to say thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, for writing this letter. I am so incredibly grateful and so moved, that you would do this for me after all I have said to you and on top of that having to deal with being sleep deprived and having baby issues. I honestly I am in tears right now because I truly thought that I would have to try and rebuild our relationship on my own and honestly I haven't got the tools or knowledge to know how to do that and I've been so stressed not really knowing what to do or say but knowing that I need to resolve things. I also knew that we needed to set some rules and understandings to help you cope with the situation should it happen again and so I know the consequences if things get too bad and this will hopefully help me to get myself out of it. We'll talk more about this on the phone but this is so good for me. Sorry I haven't covered everything in your email but I don't have much time, just on my lunch break. But I wanted to thank you for taking the time to research and then write down your thoughts, it does mean a lot because you mean so much to me and I don't know what I would do if we didn't keep in contact, not saying that to hold you emotionally hostage or anything, I would be ok, just know that you mean alot and it's incredibly important to me that I stay on good terms with the family. We can discuss the therapy thing when we talk. Hope you have a good day xxxx""

I'm so happy that she didn't misinterpret anything from my letter and that it went down so well. Good people of Reddit, you may very well have saved my friendship with my sister! I'm very grateful! Let's hope what she says is more than just words and are turned into actions. Have a lovely day, everyone!

*tl;dr: Boyfriend burned a candle my deceased sister made for me because we were without power. We have a surplus of candles that he completely ignored. Can/should I forgive him for this? If so, how?*

A few people have PM'd me in recent days asking for an update so here it goes. 

My original post was the day before Thanksgiving. Eugene and I had planned to spend Thanksgiving with my parents but that did not end up happening. 

On my way home from work, I stopped at a local craft store to pick up supplies to make a new memorial candle for Carrie. Thank you /u/70ms for the amazing, heartfelt suggestion. My parents and I spend a day remembering Carrie and making a new candle using some of the wax from the original candle. I also ended up purchasing a locket and having some of the remaining wax from the candle put inside and the locket welded shut by a friend. 

On the evening of my post, I got home and Eugene said he wanted to talk. I agreed we needed to clear the air before Thanksgiving so we sat in the living room and started to talk. I was not ready for what he told me.

A few commentors from my original post seemed to hit the nail on the head in a way. Eugene told me that when we first met, he was extremely turned on by the fact that I was essentially a damsel in distress. I just lost my sister recently, I was in a massive depression, I wasn't myself. And that turned him on both sexually and in a ""protective"" way. 

Over the past few months, I've started to become more myself. I got promoted at my job, I've joined a cooking class and have gotten out more, and I've definitely moved away from being a damsel in distress in the eyes of Eugene. 

He went on to explain that he burned the candle in hopes that it would throw me back into that phase because that is the only time he felt he was attracted to me. That's right, he is not attracted to me unless I'm upset, crying, and a damsel in distress. When I prodded for more information, he told me that every one prior to me that he had dated had either just experienced a loss or was ""in need of rescuing"". 

Eugene told me he was no longer attracted to me. He dreaded having sex with me because he could no longer be the ""hero"" that was rescuing me which is what turned him on in the first place. He didn't like go in public with me because I had started to put myself together more (like not just wearing a t-shirt and jeans like I did when depressed) and that attracted the stares of other men that he saw as a threat (taking away his damsel in distress). Eugene had a whole laundry list of things he hated doing now because I wasn't in a funk anymore.

I told him if that was the case then we needed to break up. He agreed and said he would go stay with a friend until he could make new living arrangements. My name is the only one on our house and I told him I would give him 60 days to vacate the house which he agreed was fair. 

Over the past few weeks, I've spent a lot of time with my parents and with close friends. I don't really feel like I've been dumped, or broke up with someone. I just feel like me. 

Carrie's candle sits on my desk where the original was and I wear the locket every day. Thank you Reddit for listening. I appreciate it more than you know.

The previous from my first post **TL;DR:** my best friend of 16 years who has never shown interest in me shows up at my college apartment one day and randomly has sex with me. She's been coming over pretty much every other day since the semester started. I've liked her for years but she won't give a definitive reason as to what this means or where it's going and it's scares me.

Despite most people including many of my closest friends telling me to just end things with her or force her into a decision, I decided to just ride it out accepting that I'd probably get tossed to the side when someone better came around for her. 

We went on to be FWB for about 4 months and those were honestly the most nerve-racking months of my life never knowing when or if it was going to end or what she was really thinking. I tried my best to play it off as if it didn't bother me but really it was a bitter-sweet time for me.

After our school semester ended we drifted a part a little bit, we both were spending time with family and friends. We both had extremely busy semesters and spent most of the time studying or with one another so it was expected. 

She ended up going on vacation with her parents to visit her grandparents in England. She did invite me to come along months ago but I already had other obligations so I couldn't go with her despite wanting to.


We did talk on the phone a few times while she was away, I actually had annual soccer tournament with my traveling team and we met this all girl's team at the tournament that I was telling her about it since she plays soccer as well. 

She seemed happy for me that I was having fun but I could tell that it was bothering her I just chalked it up to maybe I sounded like I was bragging or something.

Two weeks later she asks me if I can pick her up from the airport because she flew back early and she nearly knocks me over she hugs me so tightly. She never shown so much intimacy in public before she even tells me that she really missed me. 

It's like 8pm and we go to Starbucks she's being like really different, a lot quieter than normal and she seems a little nervous around me like she wants to say something.

Eventually she confesses that she realizes that she does like me as more than just a friend and she apologizes for her unfairness making me wait so long before giving me an answer. 

She tells me that before she left she didn't really know what she wanted, she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or if she was ready to be in one. She said that she was afraid to get into a relationship with me only to realize that she didn't want it and feared that our friendship would be never bounce back.

She told me that she experienced a lot of things in England and was sad that she wasn't able to experience them together. She talked to her older sister who lives in England who really put in some good words for me. 

So we're officially dating and everything has been awesome, couldn't be happier. Sorry if this update is bit lacking, I tried to summarize three weeks worth into this post without making it a novel. But if you have any questions about anything just let me know.

Thanks for the advice on the original post really gave me some solid perspective.

**TL;DR:** We're finally dating and everything is great. I guess it pays to be patient sometimes. We'll be celebrating our first month on the 1st of July.

BF and I have been together for a year. Things are good between us.

Last night this happened: my boyfriend's mom went out with her friends to watch a movie and Jessi was there as well with her boyfriend. After the movie one of her friends saw Jessi with her boyfriend. She asked her if that girl is her son's boyfriend (I met this friend at a party a few weeks ago). So she looked at Jessi and thought yes, she is.

She went to her and asked what the fuck is going on. Jessi was confused since she hadn't met her before, and she kept asking her what the fuck is this. At that point she was holding Jessi's arm and she told her to let her go and called her a crazy bitch. Eventually she told Jessi that she's cheating on her son and called her by my name, and Jessi told her that that's her twin sister. She slapped her across the face and told her to stop lying. Her friends then collected her and took her away.

She then called my boyfriend and told him that she's found her girlfriend with another man. I was with my boyfriend at that time. He quickly got it that she must have seen Jessi so he told her and she hung up. She then left. I talked to Jessi, she didn't even apologize to her. After she found out what she's done, she just left.

So my boyfriend talked to her again and an apology is not coming. She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch.

I'm really pissed at her for what she did and the least she can do is apologize to Jessi. We were planning to visit my boyfriend's parents this weekend but now I'm not sure that I want to go. I can't just sit there and tell her how cute it was that she mistook me with my twin. I sure as hell don't think Jessi should go and apologize to her.

Should I let this go? Am I overreacting to consider this a deal breaker?

188,sistersfianceisajerk,Non-Romantic,4emd76,3388,"My sister was set to marry a guy who was a complete douchebag.  He seemed like a nice catch to any outsider; he was tall, handsome, very confident, a doctor, basically the sort of guy any woman would swoon over.  Unfortunately he was a sociopathic unrepentant narcissist devoid of any empathy who would take out his anger on anybody he felt beneath him and seemed to enjoy doing it.

You know how basically they say, don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you? My sister didn't pick up on that. I picked up on it early, this guy was really mean, would berate and insult people for the smallest thing and would lose his cool with anybody who looked at him the wrong way.  He started doing it to me, and I told my sister early on this guy's an asshole.  She was like ""nah, you two will eventually get along, you just got off on the wrong start"".  I told him I've seen him do that to other people, but she seemed to think ""oh, but he's nice to ME, I'm the SPECIAL one, maybe I can change him!"" Or I have no idea what she was thinking.

After about 2 years together, when they were engaged, the cracks were evident.  My parents loved him, his dad and my dad go way back, they both went to the same medical school together and have been close friends for decades.  Her fiance is also good friends with my two older brothers.  After 2 years, my sister was realising this guy was an asshole, he's always been an asshole, and he won't change.  There was a really painfully obvious example one day when we were having dinner, and my sister's fiance and my dad were having a discussion about something political.  My sister tried to offer her opinion into the discussion, and they both snickered, then this guy just started berating her and ripping into her infront of everyone, making her feel this small.  I could sense her pain, she was just quiet and just sat there taking it.  I was thinking ""what are you doing with this guy, he has no respect for you, he has no love for you.""  

Another time our family was at this dinner function where a lot of big people were around.  My sister's fiance completely left my sister alone at the table with me, and was sitting at this other table with two women, very obviously flirting with them semi-drunk. He just left her all alone at the table.  I asked her what was wrong, why was he ignoring her?  She told me they had had an argument earlier and this was his way of punishing her.  You see what I mean when I say this guy is a complete sociopath?

My sister and I are really close, and even though I'm younger by far, little brothers aren't devoid of wisdom, and I've been urging her from day 1 to break up with this guy before she gets in too deep.  Well now, that she'd spent two years with him and was engaged, she was obviously in too deep, and she used to tell me about all the outbursts he has, how he treats her with no respect.  We often had long discussions, just me and her, where she'd spill open like a can of beans and just divulge all the bullshit that he's put her through recently.  Sometimes she'd cry and I'd be there to help her out, but she still seemed to want to stick with him.  She actually convinced herself that he loved her behind all that horrible treatment, and couldn't pull herself to cancel the engagement what with our parents, his parents, everyone counting on it.  She knew they'd all say she's crazy, turning down this smart handsome doctor! Who does she think she is?!

I kept urging her to break up, but she stuck with the ""he'll change"" or ""he loves me deep down"" excuses.  It all came to a heads when one day she very publicly exploded at him.  We were having a huge dinner, both sides of our families, and I was sitting next to him.  He kept bullying me the entire night,  ""move your elbows over"" ""couldn't you wear something a bit more presentable?""  ""stop sticking your hand out like that, its rude""  ""don't you think you've had enough of that""?  If I asked him to pass a bowl or the sauce or something, he'd hand it over but then pull away and be like ""say please, say thankyou.""  He was smiling the entire time, laughing.  My two older brothers were also snickering, they didn't seem to mind this guy was publicly bullying me and having fun with it.

He and my dad started having one of their conversations again, and my dad started airing out all his general frustrations and disappointments regarding me, and they started both talking about my life openly in front of me.  Her fiance then turned to me and started openly lecturing me, and when I tried to ignore him ""hey, are you listening to me? whats the matter with you? your dad never taught you any respect?""

My sister just then basically exploded. She was sitting at the other side of the table (guessing she didn't want to be near him) but she was watching what was going on the entire time.  She just stood up and completely exploded, it was horribly frightening and scary.  She started shouting at him ""LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU, WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON HIM. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE"" etc etc.  I'd never seen her shout like that or explode like that in my entire life, it was absolutely terrifying.  We were all stunned silent.  She had tears in her eyes and ran upstairs crying.

I wanted to go upstairs to speak with her and comfort her, my dad was like ""where are you going?"" I told him I just wanted to see how sis was doing and check up on her, he was just like ""no you stay here, you stay seated"". So he made me stay seated until the end of the dinner. For hours my sister was up there I didn't even know how she was, my dad or mom didn't care, my two older brothers didn't care; I had to wait hours till everyone left before I could slip up and go talk to her.

She was an absolute mess, crying, mascara running all down her face like darth maul.  I told her she has to end this, she's going to jeopardise her entire life if she continues with this guy.  She has to do the painful thing now and rip off the bandaid.  I told her 'you might think its okay if he just does this to you because you can take it, but do you really want to bear his kids?  what if you have his kids, and then he starts treating them the same way?'

She finally agreed with me and said she would end their relationship and break up, it was the only option.  I just asked one thing, that she doesn't tell anyone that I convinced her to do it, because they all already seemed to have it in for me enough already.

Well the one thing I asked her to do, she couldn't hold up her end.  She still somehow let everyone know that **I** was the one who so graciously helped her make the right decision.  Of course this immediately made everyone hate me.  Aside from my dad occasionally going off at me and shouting, it was mostly just the silent treatment and people giving me glares, which was easy enough for me to bear.

My sister moved all her stuff over the next few days out of her fiance's place back into her own apartment which apparently she's gonna live in indefinitely now.  Her old room in our house has been converted into a billiard/pool table room anyway.

My dad and brothers were making my life hell for me, they blamed me for everything. My mom was occasionally nice to me but she's nice to everyone, I could feel her disappoint with me ran very deep.  She didn't offer any words of comfort or advice even though she knew my dad and brothers hated me right now.  My brothers basically flat out refused to talk to me aside from a few sentence words here and there, they didn't want to engage with me on any level even when I'd try to start conversations with them.  My dad I just tried to avoid so he doesn't have an angry outburst.

It all erupted eventually into a huge fight between me and him.  He was just shouting at me on and on and on, telling me I was a pathetic loser, disgusting.  My brothers told me how much they hated me.  My dad kept saying ""its not enough that you ruin your own life and turn yourself into a failure, now you have to drag your sister down to and ruin her life? why do you hate everyone and try to ruin our family?""  No matter how much I tried to explain how this guy wasn't a good guy, they seemed to think it was just a personal vendetta I had against him.  My brother told me that I didn't deserve to have my sister as my sister, I told him to go fuck himself.  My dad was like ""what did you say?"" I told him he could go fuck himself as well.  Admittedly, I lost my cool after hours of all of them attacking me and I shouldn't have said that.  My dad absolutely lost it with me and told me to get out of his house, he never wanted to see me ever again.

I tried to apologise, he basically just told me to get out, even though I was on the verge of tears.  I left the house and they locked the door behind me.

I called my sister, she came and picked me up and drove me to her place where I explained to her everything that had happened.  She told me she'd call them the next morning and talk to dad once he'd cooled down, and then he'd be happy to take me back.  I was still kind of teary and she comforted me and told me I shouldn't hate myself or take too seriously what my dad says, and I had been the only one brave enough to convince her to do the right thing.  Her place isn't big, but she let me stay there; her double bed is just wide enough for two people but it was cozy so we slept well and fine and the next morning she called up my parents home.  She wanted to try to talk to them reasonably and see if she could make ammends and get them to accept me back.

She told me to wait in the bedroom while she had a really long conversation with my parents over the phone, it went well over an hour, and there was a lot of shouting.  She told me she was stunned and she had spoken to both our parents and our brothers too, she said she couldn't believe it and was appalled at what jerks they were being.  They said they were serious about not letting me back into their home no matter how much she pleaded with them, and had said she had to go pick up my stuff from my parents house.

My sister drove over there and picked up whatever stuff would fit in the car, I didn't have that much aside from my laptop, books, and clothes, and brought it back.

She herself seemed horrified at the way they were acting and seemed to be barely able to believe it.  She tried calling them again later and the next day again; even though they had calmed down they were still adamant that I couldn't return no matter how much she tried to reason and plead with them.  She eventually got pretty angry with them too.  They were seriously trying to cut me out of their life.

My sister told me as a result she was going to cut the rest of our family out of her life.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she told me she does have to and she wants to.  She said she was permanently cutting off all relations and contact with our father, mother and both brothers until they apologised for the way they treated me and accepted me back into their family.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she insisted its the least she could do.

Instead of making me feel good, it just made me feel worse and more guilty, like I was responsible for the permanent fracturing of our family.  So now my sister has completely cut herself off from the rest of the immediate family and cut them completely out of her life.  She told me I'm welcome to stay with her and live here indefinitely, as long as I want, even though I barely have any money and I'm a full time student so there's not many ways I can compensate aside from doing chores.  She said now that shes actually seriously completely cutting her family off, she'd like to have the one remaining family member close by. 
So here I am now. I honestly feel responsible for this whole mess of a situation. I think its good that I helped my sister get out of that horrible relationship with that awful guy, but now look at the fallout.  I'm cut off from the rest of the family, they hate me and don't want anything to do with me, and I'm not welcome back there.  My sister has done the same to them, cutting them all off, she said even for the rest of her life if need be.

It all feel so horrible and terrible, I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other.  I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them but it seems so unlikely especially since nobody seems to want to and I'm at the centre of it all.  Any ideas for what I can do to help heal this huge rift and reconciliate my family? Or should I just leave things the way they are and get on with my life, for better or for worse?  Nothing I can do to help mend the situation?

Thank you to everyone that took time to read the first post and gave me advice on how to deal with the situation. I received an overwhelming amount of responses and I've shared all the love and get well wishes with Brit. 

So.. Tomorrow it will be two weeks since the horrendous dinner my mom (Dawn) hosted that landed Brit in the hospital for five days. 

To clarify, Brit IS very cautious with what she eats but decided that it would make the wrong first impression if she had brought her own meal. We live in Canada and since I drove her to the hospital, the only expenses that would've needed to be paid would be prescriptions. If I had called an ambulance to transport her, she would've had to pay $385. I had no contact with my parents for a couple of days but my brother mediated what needed to be done in order to make this right with Brit. I made it clear that if no expenses/meds/bills were going to be paid off in full by my mother, she would expect I wouldn't be in attendance to dinner, holidays, birthdays or anything else.. ever. Brit's the kindest, sweetest, forgiving person I know. I suggested that we hire a lawyer to mediate and even sue my mother for assault but she laughed at the idea and told me that she was fine and to let it go. 

The day before Brit got discharged, she received a list of all her new prescriptions so I had my brother take them to my parents to get and if they wanted to apologize formally they should bring it with them along with a cheque for a week's pay, a week of rent and no flowers as she's allergic to pollen. Our insurance covers 80% of everything but I did indeed make my mom pay me for the hospital drive as I'll be using it to buy Brit a Tiffany pendant she's been eyeing for a while since I'm still mortified. 

My parents got to the hospital the day she was getting discharged. My dad pulled me outside her hospital room and I let Dawn speak to Brit alone. My dad did admit that the text he sent was not an apology but a half assed statement on behalf of my mom who was too embarrassed to speak on it. Brit and Dawn had a heart a heart, and Dawn sincerely apologized to her and gave her a cheque with almost $2000 and prepaid refills on all her prescriptions. Brit had asked why they didn't take allergies so seriously and just thought it was her watching her weight or being picky. So they spoke of my ex gf (who Brit used to take dance classes with) and how she refused to eat anything with gluten, counted calories, and only had low fat foods. Brit was so understanding and laughed it off. The Tiffany&Co pendant I was planning on buying her was also given to her and Dawn had even told her I had hid it at their house and was supposed to give it to her after dinner until she had a reaction. Tiffany&Co also has an allergy charm and that was also gifted to her as well and she can engrave a few of her allergies on it. Dawn has even bought Brit, her, my dad and I cooking classes so we can make gluten/dairy/peanut free safely in our homes and we'll be taking a class all together tomorrow. We won't be letting Dawn cook dinner for a while, so we'll be dining in a restaurant tomorrow night.

Hey reddit. Thought I'd update you guys on the crazy train that is Earl.

So, about a month ago I saw Earl, my PTSD ridden coworker, sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Later we got a nastygram from office management demanding to know who soiled the women's bathroom-- here was not only a mess in the middle of the floor but the feces was smeared all over the walls, with a 'Hi Larry' (our office manager) written in fecal matter on the mirrors followed by a 'Fuck Suzanne' written on another. Suzanne is the manager that works on the isolated floor and one of the few females on the floor.

So...long story short, I ended up giving my buddy that works in security a heads up that I saw Earl sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Suzanne found a...'handprint' on her car door handle that day too. Security checked the tapes but of course they didn't catch shit (some of the cameras were out). Earl wasn't questioned right away, and for the most part, people forgot about the incident (except Suzanne).

The other day, Suzanne came to work and found a huge dump right in the middle of her cubicle. Several of her things had been ""touched"" or knocked over. She immediately lost it, and ran straight to security. Fortunately, since the incident, cameras that were on her floor were now running...and lo and behold....Earl was on her floor at 5:30am. Earl's punch in time is usually 8:15. He was questioned and he had no viable reason for why he was there that early in the morning, and on Suzanne's floor. A search of Earl's locker uncovered soiled rags and a filthy t-shirt.

Earl has been moved to an offsite pending an HR investigation. We're all guessing he's going to be canned. In the mean time, should he come to the office while I'm there, I'm running out the emergency exit. (I'm convinced he knows).

My boyfriend wasn't into it at first but he was open to it and now he's also like me, very much interested. I have turned the basement of my house into a BDSM dungeon with a lot of equipments, latex outfits, cuffs, chains, spreaders, bondage equipment, swings, dildos, strap-ons, benches, etc.

My boyfriends mom is visiting from the other side of the country and is staying with us for a few days. This is fine. She's been wanting to visit his son and get to know me better and I think it's lovely.

She is a rather devout Christian and believes in things like modesty, traditional gender roles and even abstinence before marriage. I don't have a problem with her if that's how she wants to live her life. It's not for someone like me who's basically the opposite of those things. 

I always lock the door to the basement. It's a private room and I don't think it's unreasonable to lock one of your rooms when you have guests. It should be clear that a locked room is supposed to be left alone. Apparently she does not understand this. Yesterday she asked where door leads to and I told her that it's the basement and it's just full of stuff and it's always locked because I don't want my niece and nephew who visit often go down there (not a lie, it is the truth).

This morning I went out for a run when she was still sleeping. My boyfriend has a night shift at the hospital so he was away. When I came back I noticed that she has broken into the basement (took the key from the drawer in my room) and she asked me to ""answer for this"". I didn't, just kept asking her why is she down here and how she got here and she explained that she thinks I was disrespectful for locking a room to a guest and she had to find out what I'm hiding down there because she thought it could be something illegal but instead she found, as she called it, ""evil material of a shameless slut"". She then went on a rant about how ungodly these things are, that I have corrupted her son, how I'm of the devil and going to hell and she's not going to allow me to take her son with her, and things like that.

I just asked her to get out of the basement, stay in her room until his son arrives and she can deal with him as I don't think I need to justify my lifestyle or my belongings to her. She called me a whore and went out of the house. That was 30 minutes ago.

I texted my boyfriend and he hasn't responded yet. Not sure what I should do now. I really don't want her in my house ever again.

I received many great offers and decided to move several states away to work with a well known PI in my field whom my advisors greatly respect.

Not only does he get to remain a government employee, but his salary is also significantly higher than what he was making before.

I decided to just take some time and sit with the words for a bit and give my friend some space.

Original plan was so slowly ebb away (as it wouldn't cause as much drama) but as with friends you have shared a decade with, you tend to share favorite places, and are invited to family gatherings.

I saw my friend at a family birthday party. I didn't know he'd be there, nor was it like I was in charge of who invited him.

I try to keep my distance, hanging out with others, but of course (because I didn't tell him my plan to just end this) he comes over and starts talking with us.

Eventually... we get yet another friend doing the whole ""Ugh, you guys are so good with one another, I see you together all the time. Why aren't you dating? Give X (my niece) a cousin.""

We kinda looked at one another and I can fucking *see* the excitement of this talk. He starts talking that ""We're working up to it,"" and I shake my head and just blurted out, ""I'm not attracted to him, nor do I ever want kids.""

Which. Turned into this weird argument, about why would I say that in front of them (the mutual friend), and why am I not attracted (reasons lacking again) to him. I'm not a super confrontational person, so I just shrug and try to politely and sternly explain, ""I'm just not. I don't think I need a reason.""

We let the exchange sizzle down, and eventually it's just me and him again. Not wanting to really start another argument, I just head to my niece's area and start talking to her, but he follows and literally starts placing his hands on my waist, and at this point I had to stop and firmly grab his wrist and shove it down.

I told him I do not appreciate the touch, and he was starting the whole ""I can't help it,"" and it angered me, so I just told him, ""Fine then, I'm leaving, because I'm not going to ruin this party nor am I going to be uncomfortable."" I start heading out and he's following after me, and I had to wait until we were well and away from the party before I could talk again.

I told him I wasn't interested, and he asked again. At this point, I told him I'm not interested in being a desperate man's last resort (because he constantly complains that other girls don't like him), and being around him is undoing the hard work I've made in therapy when it came to the touching.

He apologizes, promises to work on it, to make the effort, and I'm just- I'm someone who looks at the words people say, so hearing him say ""he'd make an EFFORT"" told me he was never even trying to start with. At this point I'm just angrier and almost crying, and he's trying to comfort me with a hug, but I just held him at arms length.

I told him I wanted space. I am upset, and do not want him texting me/talking to me. I told him I'd let him know if I want to stay friends, but right now, I want the space, and I need him to respect that.

He reluctantly agreed, trying to guilt me by saying he'd been uncomfortable with my presence anyways, but I don't really care. I vocalized my discomfort, he could have done the same.

I'm hurt and angry, but don't have any real intention of seeing him. The touching is making me anxious, more so than ever, and I think I need to unload to my therapist about it. I'm hurting because it's ten whole years of memories that now have this ugly stain on it, and I'm just ready to move on. If I'm more comfortable without him than with him, I think making new friends will easier.

I'm going to listen to my comfort for now. Thank you guys for the words and harsh truth. As much as it hurt, I needed to hear it.

TL;DR: Guy friends does stupid shit again, and I took your advice about ending the friendship. Everything hurts, but I'm hopeful about making new friends.

EDIT TO ADD:

Thank you all for the overwhelming support. I'm shocked to hear that others go through the same thing and it makes me a teeny bit better to know I'm not alone in the situation.

Therapy is going to be very important for me in the next sessions. Thank you all so much.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit less than 3 years. He has a full time internship  so I don?t get to spend a lot of time with him. 

Yesterday afternoon, I asked him what his plans were. He said nothing. I suggested that when he is off from work, him, his brother, and I should go bowling or to a movie. I figured including his brother who my boyfriend is super close with would make him happy. He said that he would like to do that and would contact me after he gets done with work. I based my plans around this and didn?t make plans with anyone else. 

About an hour or two after he gets off of work, he texted me that he is drinking with some guy friends and can?t come see me. I am surprised he would say this because I told him in advance this weekend I really need him because it?s my first Father?s Day without my father. I told him that he should have just not made plans with me in the first place if he wanted to hang out with the boys. He didn?t respond even though he read these texts. I just couldn?t imagine doing this to him if he was in my situation. In his mind, he thinks that I don?t want him to hang out with his guy friends, which isn?t the case. I just think that he should stick to his original plans and maybe be a little more empathetic to what I have been going through. Also for context, this isn?t the first time this has happened. Even a week after my Dad passed, he ditched me for his friends when I needed him most. I talked to him about it then. He didn?t think it was a big deal, but apologized and said he wouldn?t do it again, but here we are.

I haven?t texted him since. I?ve been spending time with family instead. I don?t know what I was looking for when I wrote this post.

I told her that she was acting extremely superficial and we needed to take some time apart. She didn?t even act hurt or upset. She seemed like this was what she wanted.
I didn?t find out until it was too late, but she took a picture of the photo while with my mother. She claimed she wanted to keep the photo as a keepsake. After we broke up decided to snoop a little and looked at her Facebook. Everything is on private, and only a few certain little posts are made visible. She posted my photo of me in HS and wrote ?Ladies, it?s never too late to cut your losses. Your future children will thank you for making the right choices in a partner?

This completely floored me. This was a breach in my privacy and childhood. Public shame and admonishment was taken to the max. I called her up and my number was blocked.

I called her parents and told them about the situation, and they said they couldn?t see the post and I told them it could just be some privacy setting she has.

I tried talking to my dad one more time and he was still not willing to listen.  He even got kind of irritated this time and told me to worry about my studies and less about boys (I didn't even mention boys).  

I thought about asking the school nurse but she's honestly intimidating so I asked my math teacher after class.  She was really, really nice about it.  I trusted her so much that I told her everything about my dad and my dead mom and how lonely I felt, and she was really helpful.  She said her dad was in the military and she understood moving around a lot.  She told me to stay after school today and she took me to Target.  Before we left she gave me a tape measure and told me how to measure myself for a bra so I did that in the bathroom (turns out I'm a 32D).  

She bought me bras, curly hair shampoo/conditioner, and a book on puberty and stuff.  She asked if I wanted feminine clothes too but I said no thank you, she was already so generous.

My dad saw the stuff and he got really mad at me.  I told him my teacher bought it and he said I shouldn't be blabbing to strangers and accepting their money.  I thought he was going to take my stuff away but he just sort of gave up and went outside to smoke.

So, I have bras now, but my dad's still really upset with me.  I haven't been able to sleep much tonight.  He's never yelled at me before and I feel awful.

Edit 2: I guess I should clarify that Nita and I are not out of friends completely, and that the comments our other 'friends' were making all the time wasn't friendly advice to prepare ourselfves in case something went wrong. Some of them heard 'pre-eclampsia' and decided either my gf or my baby would die, or I'd certainly lose them both. I freaked out, even with our doctor's words ringing through my mind that Nita was fine. It was brutal to consider the possibility I could lose my girls, especially when there was no need to consider that. Then, when things were over, the same people who were so sure of death were suddenly sure that my gf and baby would pull through no matter what. That hurt and pissed me off, not to mention how much it hurt Nita who didn't need to go through any more stress.

I guess the reason I was freaking out so much in my last post was because I knew something was going to happen.

Nah, I'm kidding, I was just freaking out. But 4 days after that post, Nita's water broke. She didn't even need to be induced, our baby just decided she wanted out already. We were tense and scared but everything went well and now we're the parents of a healthy baby girl. Nita's health is also good and her mood has improved drastically because she can finally let go of that bed rest rule.

Our baby is sweet and tiny and loud and holding her for the first time was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We've been adjusting to parenthood ever since and it's been great.

A few of our ''friends'' have called, wanting to check up on Nita and the baby. One of them told me they just knew everything would be alright, and I couldn't help myself then and said that his previous words to me on Nita's pregnancy had been: 'shit, man, you gotta be strong 'cause this is probably gonna end badly'. I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone.

Update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gh3a2/update_my_35m_girlfriend_31f_uncomfortable_with/


Last night I came home from work to find a framed photo from my wedding hanging on the wall with the chain dangling around it. There was also a 5 page note from M on the coffee table. 

I'm not going to type the whole note, because a lot of it was very personal to M. However I will say that there was a LOT of apologizing on her part. She told me that she thought a lot about the ring (and even did some googling) and realized that it's not all that uncommon. She said she was completely embarrassed by her reaction and that she was uncomfortable with the thought of being around ANYBODY'S remains. She called herself disrespectful, childish, and pathetic. :( 

M also said that what I did was a beautiful thing, and shows what a sensitive and loving man I am. That she want's to be with me more than anything and doesn't want to change a thing about our tradition (taking the ring traveling). She told me she nows see's that it's a lovely idea and said my wife was lucky to have me and my family. That she as well is lucky to now be a part of my and my family's life. 

She concluded saying that she felt as though we had a good connection and handled conflict well. She said she hopes that I know her well enough to know that this isn't the way she typically reacts (I do). She also told me she was going to get therapy, as she is worried about what will happen once somebody she knows dies. 

The last part of her note said that she left a surprise in my fridge (a 6 pack of my favorite beer) and that she'd love to enjoy them with me if I'll have her. She told me to take all the time I need before calling her and that she hopes someday I'll forgive her for her actions. 

I called her immediately. We talked, and she pretty much repeated what she said in her note. I repeated what I said at dinner (that she is my number one, and that I am so sorry for lying about the ring). We have plans to see each other tomorrow night. 

I love the photo of me and my wife. I don't have many photos of us, and none that are framed. The chain looks perfect around it, and it's a nice little memorial to have in my home. I love the idea of starting a new home with M, while still having my wife's memory be a part of it.


I know this is not what many of you wanted to read. You wanted me to kick M to the curb. However, I think that a year of good actions make up for one bad action. Her apology was genuine and I really do feel as though this won't happen again. If she tries to control something like this again, and I can't resolve it, I guess I know where to post ;) 

I can't thank you all enough. 


Edit: I was expecting you all to be disappointed in me, and yet the first comments are saying how happy you are for me. Thanks again reddit!

Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my\_22f\_aunt\_50f\_might\_be\_getting\_baited\_by\_a\_guy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my_22f_aunt_50f_might_be_getting_baited_by_a_guy/)

So, a couple people asked for an update. Hope I'm formatting it right.

After making the original post, I couldn't get the situation off my mind - it was driving me nuts and really just stressing me out. I talked it over with my mom, and asked my aunt to send me some pics of 'Andy'. She asked why, and I told her that I wanted to compare them to the painting of him she'd started.

So I acquired the pictures, then did a reverse image search as many of you suggested. Thank goodness she sent me more than one picture of the guy, because only the last one got a hit, but from there, it was smooth sailing. Turns out the REAL guy is a poplar instagram model. He's got info about him being a Marine, and having a dog with the same name as Andy's dog right in his bio. This dude was so lazy he just lifted the real man's basic info.

The DOG even has an instagram, and I found more photos Andy sent to her. And to make my life even easier, the real guy has a series of videos up in his Highlights section labeled 'SCAMMERS'. I watched them and basically it was him addressing what to do if someone is being catfished with his pics. I was super nervous, but confident I had what I needed.

So from there, I slept on it, and then asked my aunt if I could come visit. My mom helped me stay calm beforehand, and the worst part leading up to it was standing in their house saying hello and just waiting to drop the bomb.

I started off with saying 'there's actually a reason i'm here. I have something to tell you, and you won't like it.'

I explained my motives for getting Andy's pics, the reverse image search, and finding the real guy. I pulled up his profile, and the dog's, and let her scroll through it while answering questions she and my grandma had. She tried to call Andy, text him, and just...it was weird guys. She used the phrase ""I'll go psycho on his ass"" in several variants. She never struck me as that type of person, but she was just blowing him up, and of course, when she FINALLY got ahold of him, and asked him to explain what I'd found. ugh, his voice. She had him on speakerphone.

""Baby, what you saying?"" (this was basically his answer to everything she said.)

""Baby, we don't need this. You just gotta trust.""

I wanted to grab the phone and tell him to cut his crap, but didn't. I stayed a couple more hours, answering questions, trying to console her. Apparently they'd actually been talking for like...two years? I'm torn on whether or not to believe that, bc as much as I love my aunt, i know from experience she can bend the truth to fit delusions sometimes. Anyways.

My grandma, who was there the whole time, was being her usual brusque self, so I pulled her aside and tried to explain that this wasn't the time for tough love, but for the band-aid-and-kisses type of motherly support. She agreed, and thanked me, saying that she's been seeing my aunt 'change', but she didn't say how. After we went back into the main room, she was trying to be a little more sensitive, but it doesn't come naturally to her.

From there, I needed to go to work and take care of something before the work day ended.

Since then, unfortunately, it seems that despite my warnings that she would not get anything that could be guaranteed as the truth out of Andy, she insisted on 'demanding explanations' and now he's got her convinced that everything they had was real, and that a friend had dared him into the deception. So now, according to her, ""they are talking, and there's a lot of trust to rebuild.""

I'm saddened by the turn of events, but I did my job, and she's an adult who has to make her own choices. I'm trying to let go of the outcome, which obviously wasn't he one I hoped for, and to not feel hurt. I know she's going through a lot emotionally, and that it was silly to hope my intervention would change things. Hopefully, she'll see the truth of it sooner rather than later, and I can have played a part in that.

Tl;dr: I found the instagram of the real guy that Andy was stealing pics from, and took the information to my aunt to tell her she was being catfished. She cried, asked questions, I comforted for a few hours then left, advising her to cut off contact with him. Unfortunately she didn't, since then, he's told her 'it was a dare' and they are 'talking and rebuilding trust.'",1551378498.0,UPDATE: My (22f) Aunt (50f) might be getting baited by a guy she 'met' on instagram and I don't know how to talk to her about it.,0.99
201,WeCantAgree7,Relationships,9pjl0z,3307,"Together for 5 years now, first year married. We bought our first house 2 years ago and are currently in the market for something larger. We're in no rush and are waiting for the perfect house. Yesterday our realtor showed us a listing for a house that my wife absolutely fell in love with. It's a house I've actually been in before and it is **really** nice. I work as a community nurse and one of my palliative patients from a few months ago lived in this house. While the house does check all of my boxes off too I fear that living in it will constantly remind me of my work in that house. Drawing up meds, doing assessments, rushing over to their house at midnight multiple times after they called my pager frantically, calling 911 during an emergency situation , and eventually returning to pronounce the patient's death all over the span of a couple months.



My wife thinks that I'm just being silly and once we move in, renovate, and make it our own I won't feel that way anymore. I strongly disagree. I've been doing my job for 4 years now and while you certainly become ""desensitized"" to the work there's still certain cases and patients who stand out.. and this was absolutely one of them. The house checks literally all of our boxes (under our price range, perfect size, large property, and ideal neighborhood) so she's really insistent. I don't even want to go for a viewing of the house.




**TL;DR:** Wife fell in love with a house. I'm not interested because I had a palliative patient who lived there. Am I being unreasonable?



**EDIT:** It wasn't a traumatic event for me. I specialize in palliative care and this was an expected death in the home. I've lost count on the number of patient's that I've pronounced or help stay comfortable during their last days and weeks - it's something I do at my job daily. That said - I still don't find it comfortable purchasing this house because of the history. I don't want to come home to somewhere that I used to work.

Thank you everyone for your posts and advice. I really appreciate it! I made a few realizations about myself and my relationship to my wife. I wasn't easing my wife into getting into a healthy lifestyle and had completely forgot that when I started out, I took it very slow. It took me 4 years to get to where I am now, and my wife was trying to keep up with my current lifestyle, which can definitely be overwhelming. 

I was trying to look for the perfect opportunity to talk about this with my wife, and to ease the mood a little, I went and bought her favorite bottle of wine and a bouquet. I went to talk to her in our bedroom after our son had gone to sleep, and she had these old photo albums. Apparently she had stopped by her parents place after work to help them with some summer cleaning, and she wanted to keep the photo album to go through their memories. I gave her the flowers and opened the wine and we looked through the pictures while we were cuddling. 

We were leafing through the pictures, and then I saw one of a strikingly handsome man in a football uniform holding a girl that looked exactly like my wife when she was 24 kissing him. My wife was so interested in the picture, and she started tearing up a bit. I asked her what was wrong, and she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her parents now. They're in their 60's, and still in love, but they have lost their shape that they had in their youth. Her dad had a really large beer gut, and her mom was overweight, but they were happy. 

She was saying that when we got married, she was hoping we would be like them. They never worried about losing faith in one another because their attractiveness faded as they grew older, but their love for one another continued to grow. She talked about her old boyfriend, who became so popular in college, and girls threw themselves at him, that he ended up straying; she was worried the same would happen to me because women in the neighborhood started to talk and say they wish their husbands worked on their bodies like I did. She was starting to feel really insecure.

Then I took that opportunity. I gave her a kiss, and then told her that she loved me when I was fat, and women like them never noticed me. She still loves me, but those women just lust. Sure, my eyes might dart, it is physically natural, but I loved her so much, valued our relationship so much, and only needed her in my bed, I couldn't even imagine laying with another woman besides her. She started crying tears of joy, and I didn't stop there. I pushed on wards. I grabbed the picture of her parents from college, the picture she had of her parents now, and a picture of when we started dating on my phone. I told her what her parents did, lose track of their health but still grow old and love each other is one way to live life. They got the chance to see their grand kids, but I know the health problems her parents have. Then I brought up my dad, and how he wasn't able to spend much time with his grandson, and how I want to have the opportunity to see my future grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids. I said I wanted her to be by my side. I took a picture of us now, and had the picture of her parents, and said, ""Why can't this be us when we're in our 40's, 50's, 60's, till we die?"" 

I told her I loved her, but because I loved her so much, I wanted her to become healthy. She doesn't need to get to her pre-baby weight, or anything drastic. I told her my story of how I just wanted to get fit, but then that developed into a desire to look good, too. She admitted that she also wanted to get back her health, and at the same time she was hoping to stick to her new years resolution to lose 20 lbs. We talked, set up a plan, so she is cutting the snacks down to two cookies a day and logging everything she eats, and portion control. That was when she brought up her monthly appointment with her psychiatrist. Apparently she had been going to talk about how she could get over her overeating habits. I felt so bad. I had neglected my wife when I was trying to become healthy, when I could have included her in my journey and it would have been so much easier to do together. We set up an exercise schedule every day, and she was joking how we should have sex every day to make sure we got our cardio in. I took the in, and we had sex the rest of the night. I haven't been as intimate with my wife like I was last night since our honeymoon. I hope to keep the momentum going tonight since we both took vacation for the long weekend ;)

I took the advice of being more intimate with my wife even outside the bedroom, and was kissing her and playing around with her while we were making breakfast today, when I hear a voice shout from upstairs ""DADDY! YOU SAID WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH GIRLS LIKE THAT!"" Ended up having the ""When a man and a woman are married, and love each other so much, it is ok to do that, because that is what leads to a baby"" conversation today. I can still see the shock in his eyes... but it had to happen so I can feel more comfortable kissing my wife and squeezing her butt in front of my son. 

I am so glad my wife does not have depression and that we were able to work together to put a plan to get back her health. She was showing me pictures of power couples, saying in a year or two she wants to take a picture like that together, so I am so glad she has that goal in mind. I also feel ashamed. When I was starting, it was to become healthy, but I liked the physical changes I saw in my body. Then for my model, I picked Leonidas from 300. But my wife, who has restarted on her fitness journey, printed out this picture of a husband and wife who are both fit. It just goes to show who loves who more, and I definitely need to work on that. 

Anyways, thank you so much for the support reddit. I really appreciate the help, and look forward to helping my wife with her journey, so that together we can live a long and wonderful life seeing our son grow older and his future kids.

I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who commented. I read them all but only got back to the first few who wrote in because yesterday turned into a shit show. 


In the morning I said I wanted to go off and do my own thing (it was actually just running errands) for an hour or so alone. He said he had shit to do. Whatever...too early for me to be pissed off, so I dropped it.


I asked again later, suggested he take our child to the park next to us since she's always asking to do stuff with daddy instead of me. Again...said no, he was going to do stuff with his hobby.


So, I broke down. I told him I needed help and that I *needed* a break from just being stuck at home 24/7 being a mom and wife. His response was that he didn't understand why I needed a break, but if I did I could just hang out in my room alone to get away from our child and him. And then asked me to make him lunch. 


I think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. I have no fucks left to give, obviously he never had any. I'm still not sure what my next move is, but I think it involves finding a job and starting a better future without him.

Thank you to everyone who replied.  Strange enough I think I needed to hear the advice from people I didn't know, rather than friends and family who have been hounding me for a long time.  

I guess deep down inside, I always thought I deserved better but my self esteem has been lacking for so long that I thought my fiance was the best that I could do.  

I honestly believe now that he has many priorities ahead of me.  One of you asked whether I thought he would drop everything if I ever got into an accident.  I'm not sure he would, and that scares me.  

Last night, I gathered up the courage to confront him about everything: the lack of romance, the lack of dates, the fact that he won't pay for anything or contribute any ideas to our wedding, and sadly, he didn't really react.  He just told me he couldn't discuss it now and needed to deal with something at work.  

I'm heartbroken and ended it on the spot.  While I'm sure I made the right choice, I'm still so lost.  I'm 30 and now single.  I wanted to be married by now and have kids.  Feels like I'm starting over.  Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.  

Thank you all for freeing me.  I'm just trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

I just wanted to thank every one of you who took the time to read my first post and for all of the support I've received since.

A lot has happened in the last couple of weeks, so I figured I'd post an update.  

I hired a lawyer and moved out one day while Rick was at work.  Because my name is on the title and the mortgage, my lawyer assures me he either has to sell the house and split the profit with me, or buy me out.  I know he can't afford to buy me out, so I assume we'll put it up for sale.  I get most of my things out of the house, except for a vanity and a dresser that are too heavy for my friends and I to move.  I moved out the day before Halloween.  

Since then, I've messaged Rick a few times to see what we're going to do about the house and to schedule a time to come pick up the rest of my furniture.  He's pretty evasive about all of it, so last Thursday I showed up at the house with some friends to help me get my stuff.  He's changed the locks, so I can't get in.  We wait for him to get off of work and come back, and he lets me in to get my stuff.  All he said before he let me in was ""You asked for this, so I don't want to hear it"".  I didn't know what he meant.

I was absolutely not prepared to walk through that door, but when I did it became obvious why he didn't want me to come pick up my stuff.  I didn't even recognize the house that I lived in just a week prior.  It was painted, there was furniture and art and things everywhere, and I could tell by looking around that Rick didn't do this by himself.  There are pictures of him and some woman all over the place.  They have to go back at least a year, because one of them was taken on New Year's, though I couldn't tell what year.  

I just left.  I can buy more furniture, but I couldn't spend a second more in that house.  Rick texted me right after I left saying ""we're not selling, we're just going to buy you out"".  I was at a complete loss for words.  I'm still in shock.  I spent 16 years with that asshole, and he was with someone else for who knows how long.  

I'm trying to get over it the best I can, but it's hard.  It would be hard leaving just because we've been together so long, but to find out that your life was pretty much a lie was a hard pill to swallow.  What hurts even more is that for years I tried to decorate my house to make it a home and he wouldn't let me.  She couldn't have lived with him for more than a week, and the house already looks different.  

I honestly don't know how I was so blind, but I'm glad I got out when I did, even if he did waste half of my life.  

**tl;dr**:  I ended a 16 year relationship because my fiance is seemingly uninterested in committing to me, only to find out that he was dating someone while we were together, and they've now moved into our home together.  


**Edit to add mini update:** I just want to thank everyone again for all of their support.  A lot of you pointed out that my name would still be on the mortgage even if I sell, so I've decided not to sign the paperwork accepting the buyout.  Rick was not okay with this, and has been blowing up my phone ever since he found out today calling me a ""petty bitch"", and that I was just trying to ruin his life because he was finally happy.  I know they're both pissed off because they put a lot of effort into the home in the short time since I've left, and honestly I kind of feel better that they won't be able to enjoy it.  I know it sounds terrible, but making this harder on them is making me feel better about the entire situation.  For the majority of our relationship, I felt like he was always the one in control of everything.  It's nice to have the final say.

I know I've said a lot how he's wasted half of my life, and I'd like to clarify that I don't think I'm too old or that it's too late for me, just that I couldn't understand why this man would string someone along for as long as he did.  He's pretty much all I've known, and it took a lot for me to leave him.  I feel like I've missed out on a lot of the dating experience, but I think I'll be okay.  I'm just going to enjoy being alone for right now.

Since I moved out I've been staying with a friend.  I signed a lease for a one bedroom apartment today, so by this time next week I'll have my own place.  I've already bought a bunch of things to decorate it with, and I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do so :)

Hey guys, great update! First, thank you all for your outpouring of love and support! I got on this morning and was overwhelmed by all your love, help, and compassion! You guys give me hope for humanity. And thanks to the a-hole who told me I was a crazy drama whore, that my husband should dump me and get a restraining order. 

So, yesterday morning, my husband took me to the doctor's, who asked me a lot of the questions you guys did. No, I didn't hit my head recently, no I don't take recreational drugs. However, I have been feeling ill lately, so the night I had the dream/hallucinations, I had taken NyQuil and Benadryl to help me sleep and not drown in my own snot. Oh, and I also had a few hot toddies, so alcohol.

Apparently, Benadryl has been known to cause weird reactions in perfectly normal people. Such as vivid hallucinations or waking dreams. 



So instead of scheduling expensive tests, we chalked it up to weird drug interactions, was told to come back if anything similar happened and to get a goddamn PCP. Husband took me home and I slept. Btw, while I was freaking out and still hopped up on drugs, I did check the call records, and his ex's number wasn't on the call or text list. 


EDIT: Yeah, guys, in retrospect, mixing two kinds of drugs that (apparently, never knew this, and thanks for telling me, bc I wouldn't have known) do the same thing was really damn stupid. I won't be doing it again. Also probably never taking acetaminophen either, judging from some of your comments. Or alcohol. Also, I'm actually really relived I'm not alone in the whole mind-trip thing. I'm sorry for anyone who experienced what I did and doubt their own reality.

tl;dr: Mom was piggy backed onto my bank account years ago, took all my money, boyfriend thinks I just don't want to help him out financially.

So I had quite a few update requests and it has been about 2 weeks since I posted. The day of my post I went over to his house that evening. I had scrapped together some cash to get him so groceries and dinner from his favorite place to lighten the mood. Because hey, I'm a giver. 

Anyways, I walked in as I usually do and he was on his couch and in front of him was a brand new golf bag. I just set the groceries in the fridge and told him what I got us for dinner. He said ""I don't want it. I'm fine.""

I was just brushed that comment off since I really wasn't wanting to argue with him. I asked him about his new golf bag and he had bought it with his club credit which made me soften up a little bit.

So I sat down in the recliner across from him and started scribbling on my note pad a game plan for him/us with a budget for him and a way he can afford a car.

I told him the game plan and he curtly said ""sounds good."" Then I went out into his backyard (he lives on BEAUTIFUL farm land with a nice deck outback) since I just didn't want to deal with him. And I just sat outside and cried. He came outside and started fiddling with some stuff in his yard and didn't say a word to me.

He said ""So should I just plan on you not talking tonight?"" And then went on about how I have been such a source of disappointment for him financially.

My (26F) last post didn't get too much attention, but I figured I would update as 1.) it's cathartic and 2.) things got pretty intense. Essentially, if you didn't read the last post, my coworker's housemate spotted my boyfriend (27M) on Tinder. He said he didn't use it. Which was clearly a lie, as many of you stated.

I truly wanted to believe him when I made the post, even though my gut (and the evidence really) told me not to. So I made a fake profile with one picture and no bio and searched for him with no luck, I matched people to keep the algorithm working but didn't send messages. I left it at that for the time-being.

I saw my boyfriend last weekend and I still didn't get an explanation. Or an apology. Or anything even near the truth. So I decided to snoop (edit: through his messages). I'm not proud and I owned up to it, partially because he had some weird exchanges with girls. This isn't important to the story, but when I confronted him, I got half-assed responses and we continued to hardly speak throughout this week. He also is currently at a festival this weekend, so I was still feeling even more insecure. I had no explanation for TWO possible cheating situations now. I was a bit tipsy last night and decided to bring up the old fake profile, setting the distance on maximum to pick up the festival location. And what do you know, he appeared.

I was too afraid to match him so I messaged my coworker's housemate. She stopped by my job the other day to introduce herself and apologise for the whole situation. Apparently her ex-boyfriend also had a tinder profile and that's why she ended things with him -- she said she had my back and would keep an eye out for me. I thought she wouldn't find him when I told her, as I was under the impression that profiles disappear after you swipe left. However, she found him and they matched.

I texted my boyfriend immediately saying it was over because he's still on Tinder and here's where it gets insane. He responded that his best mate has apparently been chatting on Tinder with a girl from my country and living in my current city. My coworker's housemate is from my country, which is super rare. It honestly wouldn't surprise me that she would get on with my boyfriend's best mate. I know she has friends that live in his town and is there from time to time, because she said that's why his profile came up straight straight away. Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me. Honestly, I can sort of see why he'd think that in a roundabout way because we're very similar. Still, I told him that his accusation and excuse for being on Tinder was ridiculous, although I owned up to making a fake profile to try to find him. I also said I know the girl who was chatting his mate, because she's the one that found him originally and matched with again him today.

I then reiterated that we were through because there is obviously zero trust between the two of us. I don't think I was right in snooping and making a fake profile, but I felt as if I deserved the truth. I also asked if I needed to go to the GUM clinic, even though I'll go anyways. He said he would respond tomorrow, but it's well into the afternoon and nothing. Closure is overrated, I guess. I'm pretty numb to the whole situation, although I'm gutted that I'll lose our mutual friends because I'll be the crazy ex who catfished their mate.

?

tl;dr -- My now-ex-boyfriend 'wasn't on tinder' but I caught him on it at a festival. Instead of owning up to it, he accuses me of catfishing his best mate. Our relationship is over.

I logged into facebook at like 2 AM last night and my girlfriend has posted a message on the party event wall saying the party was cancelled.  She saw the no-shows before I could let her know about it.  

I called her and suggested some other activities we could do, things like amusement parks or concerts or taking a cooking class.  I thought she'd like all those ideas.

""No thank you.""

We were kinda quiet over the phone, until she asked me in a really small voice if I could come over.

We met outside her dorm at like 3 in the morning.  She was crying, as I expected.  But it was just watery eyes, not full on sobs how she usually cries.

""It's okay,"" she said.  ""Some people aren't meant to have friends.""

I told her she was exaggerating, that she just needs to look in different places, etc.  She shook her head.  ""No, I'm done.""

This morning at breakfast we passed a lot of mutual acquaintances.  Usually my girlfriend smiles and says hello.  Today she just kept her eyes on the pavement, not looking at anyone.  She barely ate.  But other than that she seemed like her normal self with me, talking and laughing.  She just wouldn't look at anyone else.

She told me how she's going to use this extra time to get better in her classes, to work on her jewelry and maybe open an etsy shop.  To read more books.

I asked her if this is really what she wanted.

""No, but life doesn't always give you what you want.  I didn't want to be an engineer.  I didn't want to live in a basement alone.  I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out.  But you make the best of it.""

Her voice was breaking as she said this, but she didn't cry.  She left the breakfast table after that and said she wanted to be alone.

Where the hell do I go from here?  Her actual birthday is tomorrow (we were throwing the party a week later) and she insists she doesn't want to do anything.  Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends?  I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend canceled party, said she didn't want to do anything for her birthday, and announced that she's given up on finding friends.  She isn't going back to any of her clubs or activities, and is going to focus on her studies and hobbies this coming year.  Her actual 21st birthday is tomorrow.  Where do I go from here?

210,SoDoneLolllllll,Relationships,9z9d9f,3239,"*tl;dr: my boyfriend?s parents didn?t invite me on their vacation but they invited his brothers girlfriend. They also never make any effort to include me in anything yet they always include her. We?ve been dating twice as long as they have and I?m feeling left out but my boyfriend thinks it?s not a big deal. It?s making me feel more and more insecure and I just want to be included. What do I do?

So I?ve always had a feeling my boyfriends parents don?t like me, I don?t know why they wouldn?t, I haven?t done anything wrong, they just don?t. For example, we?ve been dating for 2.5, almost 3 years and I?ve only met his parents once. They?ve had multiple opportunities to see me when they come to visit my boyfriend but they never invite me on the outings they have. They?ve also gone on several family trips together while we?ve been together and I?ve never been invited on any, and my boyfriend used to blame it on the fact that we hadn?t been together that long, when they invited his brothers girlfriend on their trips after they had been dating less than 6 months. Ever since then she?s always accompanied them on their trips, gone to their family weddings, spent the holidays with them, and I?ve never even been invited. 

It?s just painfully obvious to me that they?re going above and beyond to include her, and not doing even nearly the same for me. In fact it feels like they?re going out of their way to leave me out on purpose. Whenever I bring it up to my boyfriend he says he always tries to ask his parents if I can come with them to these things too, and they always make an excuse as to why I can?t. He also says that I?m overthinking it, that of course they like me, ?they just don?t know? me.

My problem is, they?ve made zero effort to get to know me, yet they always reach out to his brothers girlfriend. They invited her over for dinner the second they started dating and they?ve basically been inseparable with her since. With me, my boyfriend had to beg them to meet me just once and they seemed to like me but they?ve never made any effort to want to get to know me since. As I?ve said before I?ve literally met them once in almost 3 years of dating. 

What do I do? It?s making me feel extremely insecure and left out, especially since this is my third holiday season with my boyfriend and I?ve yet to spend any holidays with him because of his family. I just feel so unwanted and like they?ll never like me. It?s hard to see them having so much fun with her and know that they?ve made an effort to purposely leave me out but include her. It?s making me feel so insecure. 

**edit: my parents always go out of their way to include my boyfriend and make him feel welcome so that?s not a reason as to why his parents might not be including me.

Backstory: My grandparents have always been a big part of my life, as well as, the rest of my family. They had five kids (including my dad) and have 13 grandchildren- 6 great-grandchildren.  My grandparents are pretty wealthy. They owned three businesses up until last year when my grandpa passed away. I?m the ?baby? of the grandchildren and have always been really close with them. My grandma babysat me until I was able to go to Kindergarten, I wrap her Christmas presents for every one every year, I decorate their house, and I?ve worked at their bar on Friday night?s throughout college (without pay) as they got too old to do these things themselves. All of these things were offered to my cousins but they never helped out.
 
My grandparents ran a horse training farm for show horses for over 40 years. This was something my dad took up with them and I quickly started to love. I rode every weekend with my grandma up until high school when I started to get busy. Even though I don?t ride much anymore, my dad and I go out and clean the stalls every week and take care of the horses when my grandparents went on trips (usually every other month).
 
My grandparents were a huge part of my life.
 
 
The problem:
My grandma passed away 4 weeks ago. It was devastating. My grandma left my aunts/uncles/dad about $85,000 each. Money that her and my grandpa worked very very hard for. This was expected. What wasn?t expected was for them to leave me a little over $45,000 along with some other things of value. I was honestly shocked. My cousins all got about $2,000 each and some knick-knacks. Obviously, you can see where this was going. My aunts and uncles were in the reading when I was told so they told their kids. Everyone besides my parents are furious. My cousins (who are adults) are demanding I split it evenly with them. I don?t feel that I have to. I was very close with my grandparents and did a lot for them but this is hard. My family is very tight and we do annual vacations together/monthly parties/dinners/etc. I never expected money would tear us apart. This money could change a lot for me. I could pay off my $10,000 student loan and put the rest toward my upcoming wedding/future children/a savings account. A small part of me wants to divide it evenly just to keep everyone together. BUT there was a reason they left me this. They didn?t do it to hurt anyone. I was the ONLY one to visit them and help them out (none of them took the time to see them aside from family get-togethers) but no one understands that aside from my parents. I feel like I?m single-handedly tearing the family apart. My aunts and uncles won?t talk to my dad unless I split the money and my cousins won?t talk to me. I only have a student loan and car payment so I don?t have much debt but this could set me up for a comfortable future. They all keep throwing in my face that they have families, house payments, college to pay for, etc. They keep saying I?ve been planning this for a long time but I truly haven?t. I loved my grandparents.
 
My fianc? is telling me to forget about them and to do what?s best for me but I?m a huge family person. I don?t want to split the money (it could really help me) but I feel that they could be playing me by making me choose between them and it.  My parents also want me to keep the money as they feel my family members are being ridiculous by demanding this.
 
Is it right for me to keep this much? I feel like I deserve it. Is it right for me to put this money over my family? Or are the people who I?ve been so close with my entire life taking advantage of me? $45,000 vs $2,000 is a huge difference.
 
So, advice??


EDIT: there's more in the will than I explained (houses, classic cars, horses, the farm, land, CD's, etc). The cash/checking accounts that were given to me are the only things that seem to be the problem with everyone.

212,gfjq23,Updates,4cfe98,3229,"To summarize the last post, I posted a Ryan Reynolds meme about Santa Claus not being real on Facebook which my 13-year-old niece saw. My sister flipped out about it and wanted me to publicly rescind and say how Santa is real, but I thought my nieces were too old to believe in that stuff and refused. It lead to a crazy fight between us. Link to the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ad97e/me_32f_posted_on_facebook_about_santa_claus_not/).

Anyway, I talked to my nieces and neither of them believe in Santa, so they were baffled about the fight. I talked to my BIL and he said my sister has been flying off the handle lately. We agreed she should probably get a check up and he convinced her to go to the doctor. 

Onto the update. They did a MRI and nothing showed up. Then they did some bloodwork which looked fine, except some elevated cholesterol. She isn't pregnant. They pretty much wrote her off as a crazy person and sent her to a psychologist for stress. After a session, the psychologist told her to do some ""deep breathing"" and sent her away as fixed.

She got worse. She stopped sleeping and barely ate, yet still gained weight. Any small annoyance would send her into a rage. Commercials were making her so upset she would ugly cry. I asked my BIL if they tested hormone levels or anything like that and he said the doctors didn't feel it was necessary.

She called me one day crying and apologizing, saying she was the worst sister ever and I had every right to hate her. She was so devastated she ruined our relationship and such. It was weird and NOT my sister, so when I got a chance to speak I told her she was going to go see my doctor and I wasn't taking no for an answer. I set up an appointment and my doctor ordered a full blood panel including hormone and vitamins before my sister drove to town for her appointment.

When my sister drove up we spent the morning shopping and she was unpredictable. One minute she was happy and the next yelling about some perceived sight (""That fucking pretentious makeup counter bitch just looked at me funny for my cheap drug store makeup.""). It was uncomfortable, So I just walked on eggshells to keep her from exploding.

Anyway, results of the bloodwork and a good doctor: perimenopause. Her hormones are completely abnormal. None of her doctors would even consider it because she was ""too young"" for menopause, so they didn't even bother running the tests. She'll be coming up with a care plan with my doctor for hormone replacement therapy and diet change to hopefully get back on track.

She still a nutcase right now. For example, she called me crying the other night because she will never have more kids (wha...her husband had a vasectomy years ago). I'm driving to her place next weekend and we're going to batch cook a bunch of meals for her new diet plan (I'll be doing it with her as I could stand to eat healthier). So it'll be a slow process, but we have a diagnosis and plan. I'm just taking her outbursts as ""crazy hormones"" right now because it'll take awhile to even out. 

I got her a dark chocolate cake for Easter that said, ""Happy Reverse Easter (when the Easter Bunny takes back your eggs)"" because I'm kind of a jerk. She thought it was hilarious though, so we are good.

**TL/DR;** Sister is going through perimenopause, so she's irrationally, but understandably nutty right now. Oh, and Santa Claus still doesn't exist.

**Edit:** Removed the comment about being bipolar. Though my SIL has professionally diagnosed bipolarism and does have wildly swinging moods within minutes sometimes (though usually a manic high or low lasts weeks), it wasn't my intention to slur a group of people.

--
I met Ray back when I was 18 years old. He was in a band that I absolutely loved, grew up with. I had even had a crush on him for soo long before we met. You can imagine how excited I was to be able to work with him.  I had a small part in working on one of his music videos way back when (interning at the production firm that he had hired with his band.) We soon started dating after that, pretty inseparable. I would always hang out with them at the studio and spend time with Ray in his place or mine just walking around stoned, happy, and in love. He basically coached me through both my undergraduate and MFA. Three years ago, I moved in with Ray, and that has been the same situation since. I have recently been freelance writing for a couple news publications oversees/working on selling some screenplays to some studios, and it has been such a strain on me lately, but Ray had been being so good to me lately, a total sweetheart. Ray is constantly on tour/working with friends/partners in California (we live in the northeast). I'm used to him not being home or not having a necessarily consistent schedule. I don't really either (I'm sometimes in California myself with some production work I do with my old cinematographer partner.) The arrangement was always nice, and it felt really good to be with someone who understood how hard it is to manage a life on a creative schedule. Honestly, I figured once Ray got back from his business trip, he was going to propose to me. I know that's stupid to just assume that, but after how well things had been going with us, I was really just getting this overwhelming feeling of love and hope that I was just so excited about. 

HOWEVER. 

The other day (week ago at this point), I was browsing Ray's instagram looking for a specific picture, and I noticed the ""tagged pictures"" tab on the top of the page. I'm kind of illiterate at social media stuff.  At this point, Ray was in California overseeing some stuff with his new merch or whatever. I felt myself missing him a lot, so I thought seeing some funny, candid pictures of him would cheer me up/remind me of how cute he is. So, I click on the tab and scroll down a little bit. I see a picture of this cute blonde woman, Catie kissing his cheek. I didn't think anything of it at first. He's a relatively popular musician, not like getting on any charts anywhere, but a lot of people in a specific scene at least know ""of"" him. So, thought it was just another fan. But, when I scroll down more...I see more and more pictures of this woman and him. I click on the picture for who she's tagged as, I click her profile...I'm blocked? Immediately, I got a bad gut feeling. I ended up logging out of my account and into my company's (I know, scummy but now it seems worth it). I click on her profile, and I almost throw up. Basically besides a couple pictures of food, scenery, or shopping haul shots, it's just all pics of either her and Ray or just Ray. I do some more digging and I see that HER AND RAY ARE FUCKING ENGAGED. People are congratulating them! There's a pic of her holding up a hand with a ring up and you can see Ray in the background smiling. I want to fucking die right now. 

It's been 3 days since Ray has gotten back from the trip, and I don't even know what to say. He knows that I'm upset about something, I think. He wanted to have sex when he finally got home (we always have a really fun romp once he comes back) but the thought of it made me fucking sick. I don't know how to talk to him about this. I know I'm just postponing something by doing this, but I honestly have no fucking clue how to approach my future. I honestly still love him so much and the thought of being without him right now makes my head want to explode. I don't even care that he was with someone else if he would just stop doing it and apologize. I understand that humans are not inherently monogamous, and hell, I've thought about other people and even kissed someone one time during a LSD trip a couple years ago. I never told him about that either. But this seems really unacceptable and I feel really disrespected. HOw could he just have this entire secret life and just like hide it...for so many years. As far back in her timeline I scrolled (5 years), they had clearly been dating. I wonder if they've been together the entire time me and Ray were together. 
  

I know this is so long and rambly but I just need help deciding where I go from here. We live together, and I don't really have housing in the area right now that would be easy for me to just *go*, you know? Should I just pretend I don't know anything until I can find another place and then just unload then? Should I try to talk to him now and see what's going on?

It's been a while since I asked for advice on telling my friend she had a strong body odor. It didn't get a lot of attention and it was a good result so I forgot about it. I believe I called her the night I posted and pretty much told her what I said I was going to tell her. I let her know that I really wanted her to get the job and then asked her if she knew she smelled (in a more tactful way - can't remember the exact words). She said she did know and the conversation went from there. She didn't give me the exact reason why and I didn't ask. I mentioned that since our work requires a uniform (I wear mine a few times before washing because it's an office job and I don't sweat), she should be washing hers often if she got the job. She was thankful that I brought it up with her. I followed up with talking about the job and giving her other advice about applying.


She actually did end up getting the job with me (yay!) and has become more hygienic. She's still not the cleanest but she doesn't smell like she used to and her car/room don't have the same heavy odor. To be honest, I forgot for a while that we even talked about this and almost forgot that this was even an issue before. I don't think she really remembers, either. It was a fairly easy conversation once I told her and it didn't change anything about our friendship. I wish I had told her sooner, but I'm glad I did tell her.

Kind of a boring update, but a good one. :)

216,Acceptable_Service,Updates,c1rg8l,3221,"[I posted a few weeks back about breaking up with my boyfriend many months ago for drug use](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bv8ike/i_27f_dumped_my_boyfriend_27m_for_using_cocaine/), but wanting to hopefully start seeing him again as he started seeking a more sober and healthy lifestyle. One struggle was his friends pretty actively painting me as controlling, and someone who doesn't love him for who he is. I was also very worried about the ease of getting away from that lifestyle.

&#x200B;

I've been amazed at the continued push-back from his friends. They had a ""guys weekend"" last weekend where they'd purchased quite a lot of cocaine, plus other misc drugs (adderall, vyvanse, LSD...) He originally had been tasked with the buy for the weekend, but ultimately opted not to go. I was going camping with my friends and told him he was welcome to come along. I told him I trusted him to go, but he chose not to go with his friends. Of course, this led to his friends calling me being controlling, and that I am changing him to meet my own interests. One of his close friends in particular has been a huge instigator in creating as much conflict as possible around this... namely attacking me on twitter, and having him removed from their friend group chats for picking a girl over friends.

&#x200B;

It's really hard for me to understand all of it and why a select few of his friends have so much opposition to this. I guess I don't see drugs as a personality trait so much as a lifestyle choice, but in their minds, i'm alone in that. I fear this sounding judgmental, but the friends with the firmest oppositions are two dudes who are 29, deliver pizzas, and spend 99% of their time high, at raves and other events like that. 

&#x200B;

We've been back seeing eachother for 6 weeks now; he's been essentially sober with the exception of a beer here or there. He's been joining me at yoga, we've been doing stuff outdoors like rollerblading, riding bikes, cooking out together, etc and he said he feels a lot more level. I can tell he's bummed feeling ostracized from his friends, but i've repeatedly told him I trust him and will support whatever decisions he makes, even if it means us not being together - just that I expect honesty.

&#x200B;

It's taken me a few weeks to let go of caring what his friends think about me, but I know my intentions are good. Still sucks feeling hated, but I'm not really sure what else I can do.

&#x200B;

I really appreciated the advice and sort of reality-slap that those people are largely toxic. There was a lot of really good wisdom that helped me come to the realization that it's not worth my energy to care what they have to say.

I met my husband 6 years ago when we both had just graduated college. He was a lovely guy, handsome and very well put together. He loved muscle cars and weight lifting and I loved everything about him. I fell in love with him instantly and was over the moon when he asked me to marry him.

A year into our marriage, I became pregnant with our son and gained about 30 lbs. I was 5'3"" 125 lbs before the baby and 155 lbs after the baby. I still fit into the same clothing sizes so I didn't think I had gained too much weight and that it would come off with breastfeeding and some more exercise. 

After the baby, my husband started pressuring me to lose the weight. He said that his friends were making comments about how fat I had gotten and that he was not as attracted to me as he was before I had the baby. He gave me an ultimatum that I either would have to lose the 30 lbs in six months or he would leave me. I was very upset about the demand, but I didn't want to lose him so I tried my hardest to lose the weight.

Every day for months I would wake up and go to hot yoga for 90 minutes. After I got home from work, I would run or do some bodyweight exercises. I tried to keep my calorie count below 1200 so that I would lose 2 or more lbs per week. The weight slowly but surely started to come off and I was back down to 130 lbs by the end of the six months. My husband was happy and things looked like they would be okay.

After I lost the weight, I noticed a shift in the attitude of my husband's friends. Most of them are perfectly nice guys, but a few of them are absolute pieces of shit (the same ones who called me fat). Once I returned to my old weight, these friends started to make comments about me and how sexy I was. I told my husband to make them stop and he said that he would speak with them, but the rude comments never stopped. I channeled all of my frustrations into working out and I lost an additional 15 lbs of body fat and got more toned.

This past weekend, my husband's friends were over at the house and one of them grabbed me and tried to grope me. I told my husband and even though he was angry at his friend, he was still angry at me. My husband said that I was leading his friends on by losing so much weight and that I was trying to make myself skinny so that I could cheat on him. I was disgusted by this accusation and packed my bags and left for my mom's house.

Last night, my husband called me and begged for me to come back home. He says that he knows that he was unfair and that he won't let his friend come over anymore, but I am so tired of dealing with this that I'm not sure I want him back. He's the one that told me to lose weight, but now he's blaming me for being too skinny and I'm afraid he's going to make me develop an eating disorder. But I also still love my husband and it hurts me to be apart from him.

I'm so confused and I'm not sure what to do.

218,soccermomontheedge,? Locked Post ?,3lbqwe,3215,"I'll try to be be brief.  I'm still fuming.  My husband (M29) comes from a big family, four brothers, two sisters, raised by a single mother for the most part.

The youngest of his siblings is J (M19) in the six years I've known J he's always seemed awkward and a little too quiet and socially inept.  I have always had a special fondness towards J because he's such a sweet person and I was a little awkward growing up myself.

J has been struggling with some classes and I've been helping him.  My husband took me on a special dinner night to thank me for this and it was there that he revealed why J sometimes struggles.  Apparently, their dad who is now dead left their mom over accusations that J was a product of infidelity.  He was not.  But their dad was super paranoid about infidelity and treated his wife like property.  The father started abusing J when J was as young as two, beating him.  He left shortly thereafter and passed away a few years after that.  

The abuse didn't stop there.  My MIL picked up where the father left off.  The beatings and abuse is too graphic and unspeakable for me to detail it here.  It's disgusting and inhumane.  My husband said that all the siblings took part including himself.  When I could no longer take listening to the details and the extent to which my husband participated I asked him why and how he could do those things.  He went into full on defense mode when he saw how furious I was and said they were told he was not their brother.  Like that's a valid excuse?  He said the family buried it and doesn't talk about it.  That J started defending himself at about 13 and the abuse stopped then.  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J.  He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.  

since that night three weeks ago I have been unable to be affectionate in any way towards my husband.  It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one.  Last weekend we had a back yard cook out as we often do.  Most of his siblings were here.  J knocked over a pitcher of Iced tea.  He's a little shaky and a little clumsy but it was an accident obviously.

My MIL went off and started berating him and called him an idiot and a few other names.  She started to berate him about his hands and how they shake so much and told him to get control of it and stop shaking.  I gave my husband a look, like, ""hey jump in here.""  He didn't do anything.  I lost it.  I went completely crazy on her and told her that maybe if she hadn't beat him and other things...

At this point my husband jumped in and told me to take it easy on his mom.  I told her to leave and she told everybody to leave with her.  J only stayed because I practically begged him to stay but she told him to leave too.  I tried to talk to my husband about what happened and why I went off.  He told me to mind my own business about his family business.  I told him to leave at this point.  He reluctantly left and has been calling, and texting me non stop to forgive him.


**EDIT**  Finally heard back from a friend I had emailed.  She's a counselor.  She told me I atcually victimized J by bringing up the abuse that Friday night.  She says I should have simply stood up for him for what happened that night.  She says I should apologize to him for that and I will tonight.  She also said it's probably going to be the first and only apology J ever gets that's even remotely related to all the abuse he suffered ""so be ready for anything"".  I'm picking him up at his friend's house tonight.  His mom kicked him out over what happened.  Everything is happening so fast now.  My parents have stepped up big time and offered to move him in.  My dad is going to teach him how to drive and help him get his DL.  He's going to give him his old car that nobody drives.  Now we just have to convince him to accept our help.  Haven't read all your comments but I will.  Just things are happening fast I need to keep up.  I know my kids will be fine.  Right now I'm in full ""get J help mode.""  I have not read all your comments but I will.  Thank you all.

Oh I almost forgot.  I spoke to my husband on the phone finally.  He thinks he's going to talk his way back.  I asked him why his mom kicked out J.  He said he had no idea what I was talking about, he didn't know.  J told me that my husband has been staying at his mom's and he was there when J was kicked out.  I will file divorce, no chance I'm taking him back.

**EDIT**  Some of you have asked about the details of he abuse.  I left them out to spare you.  Something inside you breaks when you hear the details of what they did to J.  I wanted people to read this and not have to visualize it.  Horrible and tragic are not big enough words.  

**Edit** Sorry I can't respond to every comment and thanks for some kind words.  But just too add some clarity to some questions I keep seeing.  No, he has no remorse, nor does he think an apology is needed.  He also feels no therapy is needed for anybody, just time to heal.   But at the same time he acknowledges that J's shaking and struggle are a result of he abuse.   I don't get this contradiction but I will get therapy for myself as well and try to get more answers.  Also Yes, my dad is pretty awesome, I knew he would spring into action if I just talked to him.  My mom is great too.  I knew dad would get her to sign on as well.  They like J, and they had reservations about me marrying my husband but that was for other seemingly petty reasons at the time.  I swear on my life that I did not know my husband and his family had this secret.  

I only knew that they all seemed normal but J was clearly damaged.  He is very sweet natured but you can tell he has endured some things.  I always wanted to get close to him and try to understand him but I never would have guessed.

Just wanted to say that my sister and her boyfriend decided to break up. And also that she's not getting pregnant and marrying him anymore. As some people advised me, I called my brother and asked him to help me. He came over on Thursday and had a serious talk with her. 

He told her to think about the future. Don't think about right now. Think about your life in 10, 20, 30 years. Kids won't fix a broken relationship and heartbreak isn't the worst thing in the world, she doesn't own anything to that guy, but years down the line if she decides to marry him, she'll have to deal with her awful relationship and take care of other human beings with him.

At first she couldn't accept it but after thinking about it, she decided that they should break up. Her boyfriend didn't seem upset at all and even though she's sad now, she'll get better and keep focusing on her education, which is important.

Now I have to deal with my crazy family. My oldest brother from Europe is coming over on Thanksgiving... wish me luck. Haha

I'm an only child that was bought up by my mum alone (my dad left before I was born).

We're both each other's first everything - first kiss, first sexual experience, first relationship. I love (again; well, loved) him with all my heart. I truly believed we would be together forever.

I honestly did not believe what I was reading. It was a text from MY mum saying something along the lines of: ""I hope your morning wood is as good as your afternoon wood ;)."" Obviously I freaked out and went into his phone (I know his pin code). They had been basically sexting for around a fortnight.

I honestly can't remember what the texts specifically said, once I read them I locked his phone and bolted downstairs into our other bathroom. I pretty much just sat in the shower and sobbed until he left for work. Once he did, I threw on some clothes, grabbed my phone, purse, etc, and drove to a quiet nearby park - which is where I am now bawling my eyes out.

Thank you all for the comments. I was pretty surprised by the volume. I was trying to downplay my concerns about the incidents at my parents?.

I met up with Rachel at her place before maybe heading for dinner together. I let her know that I wanted to talk about what she said about my mom during vacation. 

(I?m just going to provide a dialogue about what was exchanged to make it easier for me and hopefully less confusing.)

Me:  I?m still trying to understand why you said what you said at dinner and why you are in such disagreement with my mom.

Rachel: It?s so weird how good looking your dad is still. He could have been a model when he was younger. Your mom is not anywhere in the same league as your dad. 

Me: I don?t understand what you?re talking about.

Rachel: I think it?s odd that they are together. It?s creepy.

Me: My parents love each other. I don?t get the problem you have. I think that you purposefully brought up having kids earlier than my mom to criticize her.

Rachel: Well I don?t like your mom. I don?t have to like her.

The rest of conversation was more pulling teeth.  I had already given thought about what happened last weekend and I guess I share a chapter or two from my parents? book, I want to feel confident about my partner. Rachel gives me doubt, not comfort. 

A lot of comments mentioned that I may have been oblivious and what I initially perceived as frankness was likely always tactlessness, that I may have not noticed it was tactlessness because I was in agreement.  I think these were factors, but I also didn?t agree with Rachel always on her opinions, I just didn?t disagree either.

I broke up with Rachel last night. Her parting words were ?A mama?s boy is just plain ugly. And you?re cursed with your mom?s looks!?

**Edit**: So I rang my parents to let them know that I broke up with Rachel. I spoke with my dad first and he said, ?You made a good decision. She was dumber than a box of hair.? Then I spoke with my mom and she asked why I ended it. I told her that she was too irrational and contradictory. She wasn?t convinced that was the entire reason so I told her everything since she has a pretty thick skin. She had a real good laugh and said that Rachel?s just a mean girl and she?s glad that it didn?t take me longer than 8 months to work that one out. And she also told my dad that he's still got it. 

**TL;DR**: Broke up with Rachel. She was tactless to the end.

Plus, I get to see him whenever I like.

So yesterday afternoon, I picked up my son up from his mom's house to spend the rest of the day with me. She went out for drinks later with her friends. I thought nothing of it, because she has done this a ton of times. 

I got a call around 11pm from one of her friends, a call that I never want to hear about someone I'm close with. According to her friend, she was super drunk and couldn't even walk properly. She ran out onto the street and a car hit her. She was rushed to hospital and she died on the way there.

I'm in so much pain right now. I loved this woman. We have a beautiful child together. How will I eventually explain this to my son?

I had last spoke to him on Wednesday, where I told him unless he could let go of the past and stop bringing things up, then this relationship was over. I was done being the emotional punching bag. I ended up breaking up with him on Saturday. I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but there were a couple of things that really sealed the deal for me.

When he came in the house, I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet so I went to go do that. As I'm brushing my teeth, he immediately stated that I was brushing my teeth wrong, and, ""When are you ever going to listen to me about how to brush your teeth?"" Then, when we went to my room, he asked how much I had cried since Wednesday. When he said this, he looked happy. Like it made him happy that I was so upset about this whole thing, like he took it as flattery. 

It was at that moment I knew it had to be over. I love him so much, and am pretty miserable, however I know I needed to do it. I keep thinking that if I were in his shoes, and the relationship was so rocky, I wouldn't be criticizing him on how he brushes his damn teeth. 

When I was breaking up with him, he kept saying this was the wake up call, and he was going to change. That I was giving up on him, and at least he can say he tried and I can't say that. He was relentless, but I stuck to my guns. Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help. 


It should also be noted that I am the same user who wrote a relationships advice post about having a boyfriend who wanted me to change my hair color. I'm pretty sure I deleted the post, so I cannot link it, but I honestly should have listened to you all then and not gotten so invested in someone who constantly felt the need to want to change me through controlling comments.

The hardest part is that there were great times, and even reading my posts I worry that I was too hard on him and painted him too negatively, but I'm seeing now that this is just me making excuses. I feel terribly guilty about how sad he must be, but I know this will soon fade. You are all absolutely amazing and kind.

tl;dr from previous post: Walked in on my brother having sex with another man. Parents are homophobic and he's still in the closet. Should I tell him? And if so, how?

______________

So about a month ago I made a post about how I caught my brother having sex with his best friend and I wanted advice on how to approach him. One redditor suggested I write my brother a letter, so that's exactly what I did. I could have let it go, but I didn't want my brother to become a statistic and feel isolated.

In my letter I essentially told me brother that I had seen him and Friend together. I told him that he doesn't have to tell me anything, but I love him and he can talk to me about anything and I'd never tell our parents.

He never responded straight forward. We talked like normal, and whenever Friend came over I just kept my distance. But on New Years Eve, him and Friend and I went out to a party (no family was around). He and Friend kissed at midnight, and I've never seen him so happy. 

This was a really uneventful update but I thought I'd post it anyway.

Thanks to all the people who gave me their advice and perspective on the matter, it was greatly appreciated and helped me sort my priorities out.

?First, let me clear up some things I probably should have made clearer in the original post:

The thing with the mind reading is not really meant to be taken as a soul mate situation. Ben sometimes struggles to get a point across but I seem to get it most of the times and can tell people what he meant to say. So I think this got blown out of proportion a bit. I should have phrased this differently, sorry.

Also, many people referred to Chris as my boyfriend in their comments, which he was not. We were dating for a month and weren?t an official couple.

Another thing I should have talked about is how Ben and I ended up dating for a second time. An acquaintance told us that it was a shame that us dating never worked out and we decided to test the waters again. Not even a month in I said that it did not feel right, he agreed and said how relived he was that I felt it too and we went back to being friends. That was considerably easy since we hadn?t even had sex in that month. Chris knew that the second time wasn?t all that serious.

One comment was suspicious of why Ben hadn?t moved on so I probably should?ve mentioned that Ben had a girlfriend from February to June 2018. I liked her and she was always lovely to me. She left him because, ironically, she still had feelings for her ex. So I thought it?d be safe to assume that he?d be over me as well.

None of my close friends talked about my history with Ben and they didn?t joke about us at the party. They genuinely want me to be happy and most of them instantly liked Chris. However something did happen at the party that ended up causing all this mess. So buckle up folks.

Now that that?s been said, let?s move on to the shit show that?s been my life for the last couple of days.

After reading some of your comments I texted Chris back and agreed to talk about things that night under the condition that we both will be civil and adult about it. He was fine with that and I came over to his place.

Chris started the conversation by immediately apologizing for how aggressive he reacted and how stupid he felt for not being able to keep it together. He said it wasn?t fair of him to mistrust me and that his jealousy was ridiculously overblown considering we weren?t even official.

I told him that it?s okay if he gets jealous or uncomfortable but I just wished we could have talked about it before things escalated. I apologized for not being sensitive enough to realize that no matter what he said to me, he wouldn?t exactly be thrilled with the situation. I could have made more of an effort to reassure him and adapt situations so that we could both be happy.

We both made it clear that it would make us sad if things ended before they had even begun and we?d probably end up regretting not giving this another shot. After all, we have this crazy chemistry and got along so well.

Now all that seemed to stand in the way of a happy ending was an awkward conversation about my friendship with Ben. But before I could even get into it Chris dropped this bomb:

So at the party he overheard Ben and his best friend talking. Ben said how awful it was to see me with another guy and how unfair it was that we weren?t an item.
Chris did not know what to do with that. He said that that?s where what little jealousy and insecurity he had went from zero to a hundred and he couldn?t help seeing red. He weight his options and thought that if he?d tell me it?d end in a situation where it?s his word against Ben?s and I?d believe Ben more. He also didn?t want to be ?that guy that ruined a friendship?. So he swallowed his feelings until they burst out when I casually mentioned hanging out with Ben.

As he told me that, I put my guard up and took it with more than just a grain of salt. That story sounded almost cartoonishly convenient. Some people in the comments warned me that he could try to manipulate me and I had to look out for myself. I told him in all honesty that I?d have to talk to some other people as it was hard to take his word for it given the current situation.

Chris was very understanding and told me that to whatever solution I?d come, he?d have to accept it because as he put it he ?lost the right to be involved in this with throwing a jealous fit?. I disagreed but he was adamant about me having to find my truth.

We ended the night with me telling him that I really wanted to trust in what he said to me for the sake of salvaging our relationship but it was just so hard and I was so confused. He again said that he understands and that I should take my time to sort things out. Then he gave me a long hug (yes, this one was actually long) and I left to figure things out.

And oh boy did I figure things out...

The first thing that came into my head was that at the party in September, the one where I was dared to kiss Ben, guess who thought of the dare. It was Ben?s best friend, who, if I?d take Chris? word, would know if Ben still had feelings for me. Ben?s friend was also the person who suggested playing truth or dare in the first place even though he usually doesn?t like that many drinking/party games.

Then I thought about how weird Ben acted when I asked him about Chris. At the time I was convinced that he just didn?t want to hurt my feelings but what if he just saw his chance of getting Chris out of the picture and held an inner debate whether he should act on it or not.

My head was in bits and pieces as I overanalysed basically every interaction I had with Ben for the past months. I had to rip the band aid off and talk to Ben directly. So I asked him if he?d be free after work and he came over. We usually don?t spend time alone at each other?s place so he knew that something wasn?t quite right.

It was very awkward but I had carefully thought about what to say beforehand which made it a bit easier. I told Ben that I value our friendship but had gotten the suspicion that he might want more out of our relationship than I could give him and asked if this was true. Ben is a bad liar so he got defensive instead and asked me if Chris wanted to separate us. He used that phrasing. ?Separate us?

I told him that it did not matter if Chris was involved in this because I just wanted a clear answer on whether us being friends was enough for him or not. He avoided the answer. Asking again if this was because of Chris. He spun in circles trying to change the subject and ended up saying some mean things about Chris not being a good person and what not (Reminder that their first and only interaction had been at the party). I however stayed focused, as I wanted an answer. Given, his avoiding of my question was answer enough but I was getting angry with him and I wanted him to spell it out.

After some more back and forth he finally snapped: ?Fine! I thought that we?d eventually get back together and it was only a matter of time until you realized that we were meant to be! You should be with me then we wouldn?t have to deal with this.? His words still echo in my head.

Like, what?? I could have handled him having a little crush on me or if he felt that some things were left unresolved, but this? It felt like my entire world was shattered. All these years of friendship he just stuck around to one day get back together with me? Everything we?ve been through and everything he did for me was just so that I?d eventually realize that we should date again?

I told him that I couldn?t return his feelings. Not now and not in the future. We had tried twice, it didn?t work out, at least for me it didn?t, and I saw nothing that could change that. I wanted us to be friends but I don?t think it is possible under these conditions.

He got pretty worked up about it and it was like watching someone go through all stages of grief except acceptance. ?We can still work this out!? ?This is unfair!? ?Nobody will ever love me!? ?I?ll change and we can try again in a few months!?

It took a lot out of me but I remained calm and told him that it?d be better if we stopped seeing each other for quite some time. Then I asked him to leave. I was exhausted and honestly creeped out. I felt so betrayed. This person that I was so close to and that I trusted so much was always acting with an ulterior motive.

I called my best friend and once she heard me sob through the speaker she got in her car and came over. I told her what had happened and she was horrified. She had no idea. As word spread in these last two days it turned out that my friends didn?t know about his feelings either and most of them were shocked and repelled by how he acted.

I got some amazing support from my friends and they were great at helping me not losing my head over this so far.
Chris and I talked yesterday and I apologized for putting him in such a horrible situation. I hadn?t wanted for us to start out with this level of drama. He believes that I wasn?t to blame but I still think I should have realized some things earlier... it?s been five years of ?friendship? for Christ?s sake...

Chris was very sweet. He ordered food from my favourite take out place, we watched a movie and cuddled up on the sofa. He said that he was glad that we came out okay and somehow everything was worth the struggle in the end. He also asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I said yes.

So tl;dr: Ben had feelings for me for years and expected that I?d just get back together with him one day. I told him that I couldn?t be friends with him if that?s what he wants.

***

Hey, everyone. I know a lot of you have been wanting an update. I meant to post one way a few days ago, but things have been really busy lately.

I didn't want to ruin my Thanksgiving holiday thinking about the car situation, so I decided to wait until I got back to discuss it with my boyfriend. I was really hoping that this was all just a misunderstanding, but unfortunately it was not. 

When I brought up the rental payment, my boyfriend said that he thought it was only fair that I compensate him for the use of his car. He asked me if I had a problem with that, and I told him that I did. I mentioned what some of you said about how I could have rented a car for less if I had known he was going to charge me. I also told him how I felt like he had taken advantage of me by only mentioning the fee after I had taken his car. 

One thing that one of you mentioned was that maybe someone had suggested it to him. I asked him about that, and he said that no one had said anything. He just figured that it would only be fair for me to pay for the use of his car. I did at least get him to see that the price he charged me was too high, but he didn't think he was wrong about the fee. We ended up having a larger conversation about how tight he is with money and some other things I mentioned in my first post. I didn't intend to break up with him, but after he still insisted on the rental payment, I just realized that he was not someone I wanted to be with. I did end up paying him, but it was $100 instead of $250.

So that's the update. He has apologized and asked me to take him back, but I don't think I'm interested anymore. Thanks for your help everyone.

I had forgotten about this post and I am back to update so maybe seeing my stupidity could prevent someone else from making the same mistakes.
 I cringe when I read today what I wrote months ago and it seems ridiculous to me that I could have felt this way about another woman. I wrote that I would imagine my former coworker while lying in bed but in the end when my wife stopped acknowledging my existence waking up without seeing her face was just absolute torture. I really took all I had for granted until I almost lost it

So I took some of the advices and decided to court my wife again the hardest I could. Of course the first step was looking for another job, and it took me a month but I managed to find a similar position in another entreprise. I did what was suggested of taking over every chore and she stopped ignoring me but would simply stare at me with some kind of hostility and go on with her life. I tried flowers but she would leave them to die. My wife dominant love language is physical but I wouldn't dare try touching her so I went for telling her. I somehow realized it was really the content of what I wrote about the other woman which obviously when you are deep in a crush is amplified, that really hurt her. I tried engaging her in conversations so we could talk about what was happening to us but more importantly what I did to her but she remained closed off. And so I started writing her letters and would leave them under her pillow.

 At first I apologized for everything, for writing the post, for not putting an end to the crush faster, for making her feel like another woman could hold a higher place of importance to me and for not taking the initiative to change jobs earlier. For making her life hard by creating this situation which ended in her sleeping in the guest room of her own house, for making her cry and causing stress to her. 

Then I wrote her love letters telling her how much I loved her, how the crush couldn't compare to the deep love I have for her. I was chewed for saying I loved her because of our history in my last post but I was misunderstood. I meant that the love I have for her has gotten stronger with time. 5 years ago I loved her, but wouldn't have given her one of my organs if she needed for example while now I would without hesitation. Our history is what caused the attachement to grow stronger therefore no random crush could override that. I was awed in front of my crush and wrote sappy things about her but in the end I do not know this woman on a personal level while I have seen the worst of my wife and the love remains. 

I told her how beautiful she was and how impressed and proud I was with her development as a person since we have met, how grateful I was for her presence in my life and every single thing I was thankful for that she did and enhanced my life, how much I needed her and missed hearing her tell me how her day went, laugh at my bad jokes and basically just missed hearing the sound of her voice. This is a small sample but it must have taken a good 3 weeks of daily letters until she answered me back.

She answered with a letter of her own telling me how much I have hurt her with my crush, how I made her feel invisible next to that woman, how I never told her such loving words (until the letters) how much she hated me but also how she loved me and missed me too. Her letter allowed me to feel her vulnerability. After reading it I cried and went to see her, we locked eyes,she cried and we held each other for a long time. She started talking to me again then and softened. Honestly the possibility of the marriage ending just like that scared the both us. 

As of today we are, to my surprise, mostly back to normal and actually I feel closer to her. We continue with the letters which have helped increasing our emotional intimacy. I make an effort to tell and show her my love. I am very grateful that she has given me a second chance and even more so that she has decided to put the crush behind us. We had maybe 2  fights since but she hasn't brought it up and doesn't punish me. It really wasn't the crush on itself but how I went about it and the lack of affection from my part in comparison.
 Maybe I am being optimistic here but I truly think we are going to get through this. We will be going to couple counselling after our vacation just to make sure things are really settled between us.

228,lenabeaner,Infidelity,8tq98r,3138,"Update/More Fuel: We talked last night, and he told me he met this girl a few years ago in London while he was in a pub. They ?got on?, exchanged numbers (he didn?t offer that, i had to ask). The million dollar rhetorical question: Did this happen while we were together? ?Yes. Am I not allowed to get on with people?? I left the room.

My mother works for a law firm and has sent me the names of immigration lawyers. I?m processing everything I need to do before I make an emotional decision and potentially screw something up. The kindness-and humor- have been stabilizing and have genuinely kept my knees from shaking. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 ??????????????????????????????????????????
My husband moved here from London to marry me in February of 2017. Honestly, it was a weird transition going from long distance to suddenly living together and married, but I figured that was something we?d navigate together.


The last few months, I noticed  a change in his Whatsapp activity- constantly online, last seen time stamps at really early hours in the morning...combined with zero sex, zero touching, barely any talking,I tortured myself over what could be going on.

Long story short: I confronted him about it, even used the name of the girl he was talking to (my friend was holding my husband?s phone when a message from her showed up) and he denied denied denied.

Tonight, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I decided to scroll through Venmo feed. Seriously I was just vegging out and scrolling.
Saw my husband?s name, and transfer to the girl?s name with the title ?Damsel in Distress.? 
 
Confronted him. Then he told me he?s having doubts about this, about us. I do understand how difficult it has been to move from London to a suburb, but my empathy stops there. The lies continued.

Tells me he booked a trip to Denver last Thursday to see ?a mate?. I look up the girl on Facebook, what do you know, she lives in Denver. He then admits he was going to see her while he was there. The ease with which he lies is unnerving...

So here I am. He wants to work things out. I don?t.I don?t trust he won?t come back from Denver in July and tell me it?s over, and here I was, waiting for him and twiddling my thumbs. He?s controlling the situation, and my trust in him is gone. I want to tell him to either leave now, or plan to relocate to Denver bc he clearly has intentions.

How do I approach this? His ?I want to try to fix this? rings hollow and leaves me open to be stomped on at his will.

TL;DR: Husband has been talking to another girl, lied about it, cites difficulty adjusting here, has flights booked to go and see her, and only told me because I pushed.

Well last time I was here my girlfriend had to quit her job. But Had said she would still be able to pay rent with her residual income. The time came and she was late. And only paid a third of what she needed to.

Well I can?t move right now. Luckily my name is primary on the lease. And She is legally subletting with me. I went over a new lease agreement. And it has a weekly amount she has to pay me to catch up on rent and continue paying rent.

If she preaches this contract in accordance with my state law. She will be evicted. She refuses to talk to me. She refuses to leave her room. I told her that I don?t hate her and I still deeply care about her. But she has to pay or else she has to leave and I?ll find someone else to rent the second bedroom.

The place we rented have rooms for each of us so that we could have a private space as well as time with each other. If she?s not able to pay I?m planning on affecting her and finding someone else to rent.

My heart is broken. With the planning this for over a year. And I know she?s depressed. But she could go back to work tomorrow and make double what I do a day. With a career she?s in she could still go back to work even after having quit.

I loved her so much. And we had built detailed and amazing plans together. But she?s just stopped moving.

I know she?s depressed but I don?t know what to do for her. I?ve tried talking to her I?ve tried offering to help her. I?ve offered to take her to a doctor. I?ve told her that I?m there for her. But I can?t do this for her. It?s like she?s just given up.

And I love her, but this is not the agreement that we had together. If she was willing to go see a doctor I would at least be able to work with her. And find a way to make this work. But I can?t support somebody who sick and refuses to go see help. It?s been a month and a half since she moved and it?s been a disaster.

I feel like there should?ve been warning signs but there wasn?t. It?s like a flip switched and she?s turned into a different person. I?ve lost my girlfriend. It?s like she?s dead and there?s this shell standing in front of me.

I don?t know what else to do... i?ve given her all I can afford to give emotionally and monetarily and unless she?s willing to help her self I?m done.

TLDR: girlfriend did not pay the rent she promised she would. And has severe depression. I?ve tried to help her and I have no more to give.",1549220657.0,Update to: my(28) girlfriend(29) moved in and quit her job,0.95

Thank you to everyone who responded to my thread! It really meant a lot that you guys agreed that there wasn?t something that was wrong on my end. 

I met a couple of friends this past weekend from college and found out that my ex has been going around telling people about the nasty things he texted me. He apparently wrote a rap song too about me (should I feel honored or laugh at the time he wasted). I was really angry to begin with because I was still obviously hurt, but then I realized that this definitely would not have worked in the long term, and I?m glad he showed his true colors, even if it was almost 2 years into the relationship. 

I?m also going to start therapy soon just to deal with how much emotional baggage he unloaded on me, as well as coping with my accident. 

Once again, thank you everyone for your support!

Beth and I decided we were going to make a team effort at finding new jobs, since we knew we were going to be applying at the same jobs anyway. We have very similar experiences and backgrounds.


She and I were incredibly diligent with our job search. I can't stress this enough. I had written six unique cover letters and resumes that served as templates--they highlighted my experiences in ways that catered to the jobs I was applying. Each template had a label and a description. When I applied for a job, I would read the description, match that to whichever template was the most suited, and applied, etc. 


Beth did the same thing with hers. We also were incredibly diligent at editing each others resume/cover letters for spelling errors. I know that I read mine over and over and over again, since we all know grammar mistakes are the quickest way to get your job application sent to the trash. 


So, here's what happened. It has been six months. I've been incredibly unsuccessful at landing a job, while Beth got one almost immediately. Even though I was unemployed, Beth helped me all the time, reading over my letters, sending out recommendations on my behalf, everything. 


Well, guess what? Beth sabotaged me. In my cover letters, she snuck in a ""you're not really reading this, fuck you"" just smack dab in the middle of my letter. This was AFTER I had poured over every detail for spelling errors. Since I discovered this, I tried to confront her about it, and she has been avoiding me ever since.


Is there anything I can do? I have literally applied for HUNDREDS of positions, and I'm worried that I'm just permanently blacklisted. I'm so angry and so hurt.

I posted on Reddit a couple of days after I received the message from Krystal. After reading your comments, I agreed that I did not owe Krystal any response or action but I did think that sending a screenshot to Ross would be the best idea. If he had a problem with me being friends with him/keeping in touch with his family on social media, I would have no problem deleting them. To me, that should come from him, not her.

So later that night, I sent Ross a screenshot of the message Krystal sent me and I added:

""Hey Ross. I received this message from Krystal a few days ago. Not sure what this is about, but if you have any issues with me being friends with you and/or your family on Facebook, just let me know and I will respect that. Thanks!""

I saw that he read the message a couple of hours later. He didn't respond that night but I got a message from him late the next morning. He said:

""throwxyz22, thanks for sending me that screenshot. I had no idea that Krystal messaged you and I want to apologize for her behavior. She was completely out of line in sending you that.

I spoke with her yesterday after I saw your message and she got pretty defensive. She told me that she saw that my mom still has pictures of you in one of our photo albums and when she saw that my mom shared that memory of us on vacation, she got really insecure and took it out on you. She has never come to me and talked about it but I told her that there is nothing to worry about and both you and I have moved on. This upset her even more and she accused me of cheating and said she found a sex tape of us on my laptop and threatened to show it to my mom. At this point I just told her we're over. I think that yous should just block her on Facebook because she will probably try to take it out on you. You didn't do anything wrong. Sorry for bringing you into this mess lol but thank you for giving me the heads up... I dodged a bullet there.""

So... that escalated quickly.

For the record, Ross and I never made a sex tape. Any NSFW ones that we did make were deleted immediately after watching. I called him to firm that up and he assured me she didn't find anything, she was just using it as ammunition to try to get him to admit that he either 1. Had a NSFW video with me or 2. Was cheating on her with me.

Not really much to say other than that! I've blocked her on all social media and haven't heard anything since. I hope she doesn't have my phone number, haha.

Situations like these make me happy that I have chosen to stay single for a little while. Thanks for all of your advice Reddit :) It really helped!

Hey,

My sincere thanks to everyone who replied to my original post with suggestions. I read every comment, though I didn't have the time to respond individually. Here's the update.

About an hour after I posted on this sub asking for advice, I did the following 3 things:

1. Sent an email to the entire group, basically saying, ""Hey, this is what I've found, I don't want to accuse anyone of intentional plagiarism, but the school is certainly going to interpret it as such. I need EVERYONE to double-check their sections and confirm to me that they either have no issues with their citations, or that they are working to fix their citations.""

2. Reached out to the professor requesting an urgent phone call.

3. Spent the entire night looking through the entire paper. And guess what I found. Yep, *another person in our group did the same thing with her section.* It was actually even worse than what Guy #1 did, because she would copy/paste information from the same source for 3 or 4 sentences in a row, and then she would only add the footnote at the end of the very last sentence in the paragraph.

The next morning (Monday), 2 things happened:

1. Only one person in the group (the 4th person) replied to my email. He confirmed that he did not have any issues with citation in his parts, and volunteered to help me look through the entire paper and check citations against original sources.

2. Our advisor and I had a phone conversation. She was surprisingly accommodating about the whole thing. She said that since I was voluntarily bringing it to her attention before the paper was due, she would be willing to give us some leeway. She gave us a 12-hour extension for submitting the paper, and she promised that after she runs the paper through a plagiarism detection software, if she does spot anything that is suspect of plagiarism, she would discuss it with our team FIRST before taking anything to the academic board or whatever it's called.

Guy #4 and I spent all of Monday going through the paper again and pulling every single source that every single person had cited, looking at the exact page numbers in the PDFs and making sure that citations were done correctly. It was an absolutely exhausting, draining, miserable process. Guy #1 and Girl #2 were probably dead or something during this entire time, because we didn't hear a peep from them. We submitted the paper by the extended deadline, and I think we're good to go, even though I wish Guy #1 and Girl #2 had been penalized in some way because I worked so fucking hard to cover their asses.

A couple of thoughts:

1. Don't believe anyone who says group projects are a taste of the real world. They are not. I've been working professionally for the last 6 years, and I can tell you, I have never worked with a single person - even government employees - who has been as incompetent, lazy and just a plain dimwitted fucknut as the people I've encountered in grad school.

2. We messed up long before this, by not finishing our paper sooner. Honestly, for me, I was the only person in the group with a full-time job outside of this full-time masters program, so I've been extremely busy, but I know it's not a good enough excuse for procrastinating. I guess I just never imagined that grad students would need someone to educate them about what constitutes plagiarism. 

3. Yes, pulling something directly from a source without using quotation marks, even if you have a footnote, is plagiarism -- our advisor confirmed.

4. Don't do group projects! Period! I had the option to do a solo thesis and I chose to go the capstone group project route, because our program heavily discouraged the solo thesis option. Look where it got me!
  
Thanks everyone. Lesson learned. Never talking to these fuckers again.

So I read a lot of the advice and decided that I was going to talk to her about a possible break up. I know this makes me sound like a shit person but honestly I'm just a very touchy guy and express my affection by touching and being touched. Not being able to cuddle or hold hands or sleep next to my girlfriend was not going to work out for me and just felt like a constant tease you'd get from a long distance relationship where you'd think about holding and cuddling your gal or guy but just don't end up doing it. Honestly it was not gonna work out. 

I brought my gf to my house after telling her we had to chat. I started by telling her that I'm really sorry and like her very much but I don't think things will work out with our different cuddling preferences. She started crying and said she didn't want me to be turned off by this but she actually loves cuddling but has a ""sweating disorder"" and when she cuddles she gets super sweaty like I'm talking hella sweaty. She said her ex boyfriend dumped her because of her sweating and she said that's why she didn't want to cuddle with me. She said the same thing happens when she holds hands and she gets super sweaty. She said she was afraid cuddling with me would make me leave her like with her ex in the past.

I felt bad that I've been giving her so much shit about it and it was like an insecurity she had and I told her that I don't really care if she sweats on me its all good. She laughed and said ""no I actually sweat buckets"" and I told her ""can you sweat buckets on me?"" :P she thought about it and then she said ""okay but don't break up with me over it if I sweat too much!"" In a joking voice. 

She layed beside me and we cuddled and it felt so fucking good to finally feel that with her. She actually managed to sweat so much that my shirt was pretty wet and the bed sheet was soaked and I told her that I found it pretty cool. She said that she is so happy that someone appreciates cuddles and doesn't mind the sweating and I was just so happy we were finally cuddling. I told her I didn't mind getting soaked cuddling and said ""at least now we can have kisses in the rain in bed"" and she couldn't stop laughing. She asked if we could hold hands in bed to show me how sweaty her hands get and again my hands were wet as hell which I didn't mind. She said ""if you ever need to wash your hands and there's no sink available just hold my hands!"" Which was really cute.

It's been an amazing day and I'm just really happy things worked out. I told her that if she felt like things her ex said to her were hurting her and still making her feel insecure she should really consider maybe seeing a therapist to help her feel more comfortable. She agreed and said that the fact that I like her sweating lifted a burden off her shoulders since she loves cuddles. Hopefully all goes well!

So...y'all got so unexpectedly riled up about this! I seriously didn't expect to get so many comments, although I did read all of them. Made me look again at that night's events and how some of it might be hurtful/weird to an outsider's perspective. So thank you guys for that.

The next morning, after breakfast, we were back in my bedroom, and I tried bringing this all up again. And he immediately looked uncomfortable and said, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry I mentioned all that stuff, can we just pretend I never said anything?"" And I was like, ""No, no, let's talk about this"" and I started launching into this whole prepared speech about my brother making me laugh super hard and using the bathroom when I was showering...and he just seemed really distracted and kept shooting looks at my bedroom door. I stopped and asked if something was wrong and he said, ""Look, can we maybe talk somewhere...not in your parents house? I'm just super paranoid they're going to knock on your door any minute."" Which kind of startled me again, but I said OK and we ended up walking to a nearby park and sitting on a bench for a while.

So we ended up having a SUPER long talk, but here were the basic points.

1) His family was VERY VERY different from my family. I mean, he was an only child for most of his childhood, and when he got stepsiblings, they were all teenagers already and they moved into a house with a million bathrooms. So sharing a bathroom, family nudity, all that? A very strange and foreign concept to him. When my brother got up, knocked on the bathroom door, and then walked in after I gave him the OK, it just...really freaked him out. He didn't know what to make of that.

And then I gave my side of the story, saying that, as he could clearly see from staying at my house, we DID NOT have three bathrooms when I was growing up. And while I'd say...for 90% of my showers, I got the bathroom completely to myself, every once in a while...you know, someone really has to go pee! I mean...that's it! It's just...not a big deal to me and family! And besides, once my boyfriend and I move in together, this will all be a non-issue anyway, right? My brother and I won't be sharing a bathroom again any time soon after that.

2) What he was TRYING to say about me ""dialing back"" my relationship with my brother was more like...he knows I spend a lot of time with my brother. Like, two or three days a week, not including all the time I spend at my parents doing family stuff (which is typically another one or two days a week). How much time was I planning on spending with my brother (and family) when he moved here? Was I going to be out five nights a week? Or was my brother going to be around our place all the time? Because that thought...really bummed him out and made him feel like he wasn't a priority.

That made me upset. I never meant to make him feel like he wasn't a priority! But honestly, I hadn't really thought about how much time I was going to spend with family when he moved here. So we talked about that for a while, and expectations and boundaries were figured out. And no, I will NOT be out five nights a week with family and my brother will definitely NOT be hanging around our place all the time.

3) I apologized about my comment about how my brother was the only person who can make me laugh that hard. He got embarrassed again and said that there was nothing inappropriate about that, and he apologized for saying for phrasing it that way. But y'all were right: he was jealous. But he wasn't...REALLY jealous of how hard my brother made me laugh, although that was part of the reason. He was jealous that my brother and I can see each other whenever we want, but my boyfriend and I can't do that, since we're long distance. And he was jealous that I had such a tight relationship with my brother, and how my brother knew me so much better than he did. The only person in my boyfriend's life that knew him better than anyone else was me. But...he wasn't that person to me in my life. If that makes sense.

I didn't really not what to say to that, so I said something like, ""I'm sorry, but...like, I don't really know what to say. My brother has known me for thirty years, and you've only known me for three. So yeah...he does know me better than almost anyone else, but that doesn't mean my relationship with him is 'better' than my relationship with you. It's just different.""

He conceded that this was just a hang-up he needed to work out on his own. Which is...fine, but I still kind of feel like I botched the landing at this point in our conversation. :/

4) AND FINALLY! I wasn't expecting this, but he told me that while he was really appreciative and grateful that my parents were letting him stay in their house, he...kind of really didn't want to stay with them when he was visiting me. Again, being around family all the time was a weird concept to him in general, but he also just wanted some privacy with me. He said staying at my parents house made him feel like a teenager sneaking around with his high school girlfriend again. He really wanted to stay in a hotel, he actually brought that up with me a few weeks before he came out to visit, but I scoffed at the idea. I was totally thinking in terms of money, the idea of privacy didn't even cross my mind. ""Why would you want to stay in a hotel? You can just stay at my parents house with me!"" He then said something about making too much noise and distracting them and I was like, ""Pish posh! Don't be silly, my bedroom is all the way on the other side of the house, they can't hear anything. My parents are so excited to see you! My dad really wants to show you the fig tree he planted and blah blah blah --"" And he was just like, ""Yeah, OK, you're right. We should save money."" He didn't want to object or make waves because he thought that would hurt my feelings. But I kind of felt like a colossal idiot for not realizing what he was actually trying to tell me, so I apologized for being so thick. Although, I did say something to him like, ""Look, I sometimes forget that not everyone likes being around my family as much as I do. Please, please, please tell me if you're ever feeling overwhelmed by them, or want to be away from them, or anything like that. I get it! It won't hurt my feelings!""

So we actually pulled out our phones and looked up some hotels in our city right there in the park. We found a somewhat expensive one near downtown, but I was like, ""Whatever, I'm making bank at my job and I basically have no bills to pay since I'm living with my parents, let's stay there!"" Which made my boyfriend stupid happy! We went back to my parents' house and while he was packing his bag, I told my parents that we were going to go crash at a hotel for the rest of my boyfriend's visit. They both started to object, but when I said, ""Well...we'd just really like some privacy,"" they understood. Well, my MOM understood. My dad just kept saying, ""I don't understand why you're spending money on a hotel when you have a perfectly good bed right here."" So...I think that's where I get some of my thick-headedness.

We had an amazing few days together at the hotel. Oh, and there was this super cute moment that I'm just going to share with you guys even though it's cheesy...We somehow got back on the topic of my brother knowing me for three decades. And at one point, I jokingly said something like, ""If you don't know me as well as my brother does after we've been together for 30 years, then that's your fault, not mine."" And then he got all quiet for a second and got a cute little smile on his face and was like, ""You think we're gonna be together in thirty years?"" And I...blushed a little and said, ""I'd...really like to be."" And he said, ""I'd really like that, too."" Which made me all...warm and happy inside.

Anyway, I think that's everything. It was just a combination of miscommunication and growing up in very different familial backgrounds. He should probably be moving here in the next two-ish months, and I SERIOUSLY CANNOT WAIT OMG. It's going to be so great, I cannot wait until he gets here, it's going to be so so so great. :D

She got ready as usual in the morning, and hopped on over to our favorite breakfast spot. when we were done, she said something like, ""this is so thoughtful, how wonderful we get to spend this morning together. thank you, thank you"" which got me all excited because I knew she was expecting to go home afterwards, but SURPRISE! We get in the car and head further north. she was all like, ""what's happening?"" and when we stopped at ANOTHER coffee spot, she burst into laughter saying, ""oh my gosh are you serious MORE coffee? you really want to spend the day with a lunatic?"" to which i respond, OF COURSE.


and when we get to seattle she's still giddy. we live close to seattle but hardly ever get time to just walk around and enjoy seattle because it's normally business, or we're just too busy ourselves to have a leisure day. we go to little shops and look around and she loses herself in some kitchen shop for a good hour and a half (seriously). and once again, she's like, ""wow, this has been incredible thank you for this amazing day"" thinking we're about to go home, and that's when I give her the watch! she starts crying and says that this is the most thoughtful thing anyone has done for her. and she LOVES our anniversary engraved into it. she even said, ""ah! I don't want to wear it because I don't want to hurt it!"" but put it on anyway. in fact i feel like she was flashing it off :) which she never does with any jewelry.


and then, we were going to go to dinner but the restaurant goofed and didn't write down our reservation. she wasn't upset at all and suggested we go to *Chipotle* for our v-day dinner! so we went and she loved it because she said it was the perfect day where she didn't have to be ""on"" or ""too formal"" and ""boring"" with her family. she then laughed and mentioned how weird it was that her dad got her a watch and so did i, and that she's so grateful for me and our relationship & not to be intimidated by it all because she prefers ""this way of living"" (relaxed? i guess?)

So, my co-worker is kind of a weirdo (I'll call her Mary for the sake of this post). Her and her husband are one of those people that have a ton of adopted kids (eight so far) and are super religious. To each his own. Mary enjoys telling everyone at work her business, so when she decided to adopt a kid from the Ukraine, everyone heard about it. She went with an older kid because it was easier for her and her husband (she says). This was two years ago.

Mary has asked me to babysit the boy a couple of times (I'll call him Tony), and it's never been a problem because I like kids. I didn't see any glaring problems despite Mary's constant dramatics about how awful the kid was and he seemed to like being over (it's just me and my boyfriend here, and our place is small but clean and really well kept. Mary's house is...disgusting for lack of a better word). Mary would harp constantly about how much Tony liked it at our house but I just chalked it up to the kid having a good time.

Lately Mary has been at work, talking to anyone that'll listen about how awful Tony is, how horrible he is to the other kids, and how she's going to get rid of him. She sent out a freaking mass email to everyone in our department asking if someone wanted to take her kid from her. She calls it ""re-homing"" and that its okay. I logged onto Facebook today and same story...she has pics of Tony posted to her timeline advertising him for re-adoption and to contact her if interested!! 

I haven't replied to her email yet, and I haven't commented on her post but I'm this close to ripping into her for what she's doing. She's crossed the line from weird into full blown psycho. Should I call CPS? The police? I don't know much about adoption and a quick search for rehoming gets me mostly results about animals. Any advice?

. 

Sorry for the formatting. I'm on mobile. Well here goes....


I'm going to pick up where I left off with the last post and detail what happened from there.


My girlfriend called me at 1am and apologized profusely saying she didn't realize what time it had gotten to because she was busy. (She normally calls me around 11:30 or so). I decided then and there that I was gonna save the texts from Dave, a screen shot of the email, and confront her when I got home. I weighed my options and decided it was better to be cheated on and let it go on a few extra days and spend time with my family, then to rush home or accuse her over the phone and find out she was planning something for my birthday....I think that would ruin her trust in me forever. 
Nothing seemed odd when she called. She asked after my family, sent me a few progress pictures of the quilt she was making for my mom, told me she loved me and that she would call me in the morning.


Monday morning my grandma took a turn for the worse and my brother, mother, and father all gathered at the hospice to spend the final hours with her. Somewhere in the very wee hours of Tuesday morning she passed away from lung cancer.....seriously people, put down your cigarettes. 


We were really her only remaining family. My father was an only child, and she had no living siblings, and she had moved in with my parents awhile ago and hasn't kept in touch with anyone. In leu of planning a traditional funeral, we just decided to proceed with having her buried next to her husband's plot (something she had already pre-planned, paid for, and requested in her will) and spent Tuesday gathered around in the living room telling stories about her and looking through her shoeboxes full of photographs to create an updated photo album. It was nice, actually. My girlfriend kept in constant contact with me through this whole thing and talked to my parents as well. They love her. 


During that time I decided to let everything fall out of my mind other than my family. 
It was pretty evenly split on what people believed about my girlfriend, but what felt right in my gut, was that she was planning something from me.


Many of you said I was denying any possibility she was cheating and had my head in the sand. That she was blowing this guy, fucking him in my bed, and that she was on some sort of penis-related carnival ride? 


Some said I trusted her too much and that it would come back to bite me.


And many of you said I didn't trust her enough. That I was letting what my friend saw cloud my judgement. 


There is some truth in that. Many of you wondered if Dave hated my girlfriend or wanted to get with her. I promise you that is not the case at all. Dave has been cheated on before and just wanted to look out for me. If I had asked him to confront her he would have done it in a heart beat, but even he thought something was up knowing us for as long as he has. I asked him to leave it and that I would deal with Everything when I got home. If there really was nothing going on, I didn't want to risk crushing her spirit when she was just trying to do something nice for me.


I let my girlfriend know I would be home sometime Wednesday...but I was gonna have breakfast with my family first. She requested I call her when I get in the state. 


This was my intention, but I was getting so homesick, and I just really needed to see my girlfriend, so I hit the road sometime around 5am. With no rest stops and minimal traffic, I made pretty great time and got home at 10:30 or so.


As I pulled into the driveway, I saw the white truck parked there already.


I swallowed the lump in my throat and walked up to the front door. I kept repeating in my head that I trusted her and that there was nothing going on.
As I walked in the front door (which enters into the living room) I locked eyes with the guy. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor in sweat pants and a tank top eating cereal off my coffee table. He looked younger than I thought he would be from Dave's description. But he had a full beard and long black hair in a ponytail.
He nodded and said, ""hey dude. Welcome back.""


Which felt odd....I just stood there, staring at him, wading through the surrealness of the situation looking for the right words. 
My girlfriend then came down the hallway, smiled, and hugged me. 


""Hey. I'm so, so sorry about grandma. Any chance you remember my cousin Max? I know It's been awhile.""


I stared at him and I swear I had never seen this person in my life. I just had this sinking feeling and only replied, ""I don't think we have met....""


""Aunt Ellen's son. The one that lives in (other state).""


And suddenly it dawned on me. Her aunt Ellen's husband, Uncle Joe, was her SECOND husband. She married young but split up with this kid's father pretty early.....Max lives with his dad in (other state) and Max's dad is 100% Italian.....which explains the hair.


All I could say was, ""whoa man. You've grown up....""


He just laughed and said ""yeah. I've changed a bit.""


The last time I saw this kid he was a chubby, neon green haired, acne covered teenager in an tapout t-shirt. He really came out of puberty well....I
Think I last saw him four or five years ago on Christmas. 


She asked me if we could talk. So I followed her into our bedroom. She basically said he was moving back in with aunt Ellen and getting a job as a grunt with her family construction company part time. He wants to go to a local college around us and my girlfriend promised to help him fill out his FAFSA, polish his entrance letter, and study for his placement tests in exchange for some work. (He went to an alternative trade school for carpentry his last two years of highschool and my girlfriend's dad says he did pretty well.) 


She said she had something planned for my man-cave but they hit a few hang ups and it's taking longer than expected. 


She brought our x-box upstairs into the living room and has made me swear I will not enter the basement for any reason until my birthday.


I debated pretending I wasn't worried at all....but I like that we are always honest with each other. I told her Dave saw her out with her cousin and had me a bit worried about him. She just laughed and said, ""I didn't realize he saw us together! I thought you meant he just saw me."" She said they had walked basically around opposite ends of the store shopping separately. They only met up to check out. She asked why I didn't just ask her who it was. She said could have told me it was Max and still been able to keep the exchange of work under wraps and just told me about the college thing. 


I basically told her I didn't want to make her feel like I was accusing her of anything, which I think she appreciated. 


Max is going to be staying here a few more days longer than she planned, which I wish she would have told me about....but after this....that seems like nothing at all. I think she is a bit upset that I could even think for a moment she would cheat on me....but she said she was glad I didn't come flying home early kicking doors in or anything. 


So I think we are good. Just in case, I'm gonna kiss her ass for a awhile.

**edit 1:** maybe I should clarify that max is NOT moving in with is. He is moving back in with his mom. He was already supposed to be home with her by the time I came home...but they hit some snags with whatever he is working on. He is staying a few more days to finish up then going home to his mother's. 

**Edit 2:** For those asking why my girlfriend would not tell me why Max was over, she didn't know Dave saw her WITH him, she just thought he saw her in the paint department by herself. I think she wanted to not arouse any suspicion at all in me. He was supposed to be done before I even got home. 

I remember her mentioning that he was in carpentry school. I didn't know it was part of a two year high school thing, and for some reason I was picturing him as a lot older than he was (I think I had him confused with his older step brother?). 

I've had my brother over when she was visiting her best friend out of state before and it was a non issue. We have a pretty open door policy when it comes to close friends and family so having him over is a total non issue for me. 

I see how it would be an issue for some people. But it's not in our relationship.

I think she just wanted me to spend time with my family and not focus on what was going on at home in the slightest. 
She was going to tell me about the FAFSA/college thing If I asked, but since I didn't, she just decided to keep it under wraps.

someone advised me that i write my brother a letter apologizing, which i did. i apologized for being mean and hurtful, and that I was wrong for doing that. i also got him a separate card and wrote a message thanking him for everything he's done for me. I went to his house with my letter and card when I found out he was home to go talk to him, but unfortunately when I got there he was gone already, so I slid them under the door. 

When he got back home he found them and read them, and then he called me to arrange to come see me. He came over here and I apologized in person for what I said. He was very straightforward with me and honest about my actions. He explained that the reason he had been avoiding me lately is because he needed some time apart because he was beginning not to like me. He said loved me, but I he didn't want to be around me sometimes.

That was pretty hard to hear. He said that lately I've just been not very nice, the comment about our Dad was by far the worst, but I make other snappy comments. He had tried to brush it off as me being 'just as teenager', but had now decided it was best to let me know. ""Being a teenager is not an excuse to be a constant asshole to everybody at home"", is how he put it. He gave a few examples and looking back he was absolutely right. 

It was pretty upsetting to hear. I know he wasn't saying it to upset me, and I was thankful that he was telling me (or at least I'm thankful now). I promised that I would check my attitude, he said a little more thoughtfulness was all I needed, and that even though sometimes I act like an asshole he knows I'm not one. After we finished talking we hugged, he told me not to forget that he loves me and that I'm great. 

Since then I've been trying to be more considerate. I really am trying to follow the advice he gave me. It's been a couple months now, and I'm happy to say that it's working. Our mom told me a couple weeks ago that Im a joy to be around. In the car earlier today my brother told me that its been really nice spending time with me lately. so thats good news. 

TL;DR apologized to my brother for the terrible thing I said to him. he warned me that I was turning into someone that he didn't want to be around, even though he loved me. i've worked on fixing my attitude over the past two months, and today my brother told me its nice to hang out with me these days.

241,ThisIsNotTammy,Non-Romantic,3kfa5d,3085,"I lied, this is Tammy. 

I am 23f and I have an 'Irish' twin, Brock [22m]. 

Brock is an idiot, sometimes. He can be really fun to be around, but he tends to not listen to things. If Jackass could be the life philosophy of anyone, it would be Brock. There is a reason we don't hang out much, because he always does stupid stuff. Even when I have sat down, explained in detail what I need from him, he is always saying ""he forgot."" 

To be honest, at this point, I go out to a mall to hang out with him because he doesn't do stupid stuff in public. He just does it in other people's homes. Which is fucking annoying. If he wasn't my brother, I honestly don't know if I would want him around. But I love the fucker and at the moment do not want to sever contact because of stupidity, though that is not out of the question as I get older. 

Right now, I guess, I am hoping he grows out of it. Hope being a delicate word. 

The point of this? 

Over Labor Day weekend, I went to my mom's home to see the family. We had ribs, visited, and had a great time. I went inside to change for the gym, because I had work in two hours and my mom is right down the street from my gym. So I was going to go there, change for work and shower after. 

I had my phone, iPod, earphones, and Fitbit on me when I went to say goodbye to everyone. My fitbit is white and i had my huge earphones around my neck. Brock even commented on how I have 'way too much stuff to exercise with.' I was saying goodbye to my sister (who was in the pool with her son) (30f and 7 male). 

Brock came up behind me and pushed me into the pool. Not only did all my things get destroyed, I hit my wrist on the side of the pool and had to miss work. 

He destroyed over $1200 worth of things. 

My mom yelled at Brock and he was asked to leave. I went to Urgent Care and I cracked the bone. My mom told me she was sorry it happened and my sister has now told Brock he is not to come to her home for a while or see her son, because she thinks he is dangerous in the name of a joke. Brock is really upset because he was supposed to take Nephew camping. 

People have been giving Brock a lot of talks about being responsible and paying your debts. Brock has told me he is sorry, but my wrist hurts and I am really angry about what happened. He has been told not to do anything 'funny' to me because I hate it. I hate pranks because of him. I hate surprises because they always seem to be cruel. 

I have not spoken to him and told him I want those things replaced ASAP. He gave me $400 and told me to ""take a joke."" 

My mother came over earlier today and gave me a wrapped box. She had the receipt for the PS4 and a ton of games. She said everyone in the family pitched in because Brock wanted one, but since he destroyed all my stuff, I should return it to buy a new phone and FitBit. My phone, alone, cost about $400, so the rest of the things still had to be paid for. The total cost of the gift was about $800 (with games and accessories.) 

I thanked my mom, and told her she didn't have to pay Brock's debt. She said she understood Brock would never pay it and this would be a better lesson.

So I returned everything and have a new phone, iPod, earphones, and fitbit. 

Now Brock is furiously sending me texts about how his birthday is ruined because I guilted Mom into ""giving up his present."" He claims he was going to pay me back ASAP, but I told him that I shouldn't have to wait months to get my things paid for because he didn't want to pay up right away.

I told a few friends what happened and its 50/50. Some people said it was wrong to take his gift, as birthdays shouldn't be about getting even and he was an adult. I could have gone through small claims court. 

Another friend said I should cut my brother off. 

I am not sure, I just wanted to get other people's opinions on how to handle this. I am not really in the best frame of mind, as I have been typing with one hand.

What do you think is the best way to handle this?

Now, Kacie is a bit of a control freak. She has mostly had final say on everything in the wedding, not that I'm complaining. She has better taste than me and the wedding is going to be really beautiful thanks to her.

The one thing she has let me have complete control over is the first dance. I was ecstatic. I really wanted to show her how much she means to me with this dance. I picked out Peter Gabriel's ""The Book of Love"" and edited a video of pictures of her and I growing up, meeting, and falling in love. And then I commissioned an artsy friend of mine to make a literal Book of Love with all our pictures in them. I've cried every time watching it. The whole thing is going to be a huge surprise for her.

The only other person who knew about this was Kyle. He kept saying how cool it was I was doing this and how he wished he'd thought of something like it.

Kyle's wedding was this weekend. And holy shit, their first dance was to Book of Love and he edited a video of their baby pictures and their relationship. My heart fucking sank like a brick. He wouldn't talk to me during the reception and hasn't responded back to any of my texts.

What the hell do I do? I can't go through with my plan. Our social circles intertwine and I'll look like I stole his idea. Should I just tell Kacie and have her help me with a new idea?

Anywho, went to her place yesterday and she looked a lot better, but wasn't feeling the best. Pretty much dragged her to the car and took her to our local clinic. They said she had something called Gastroenteritis, which they felt was caused by contiminated food. So yeah, wasn't the flu like a lot of you guys were telling me, but I am not the smart one, she is, I just work at a factory. She was sick, I assumed the flu, sue me.

Anyways, they said she was over the worst of it, but that she was almost dangerously dehydrated, so they gave her a fluid IV yesterday. Afterwards they told me to get her to consume food and drink with electrolytes, so I have made her drink gatorade and eat bannas(What they told me) yesterday and today. They told me that if it ever happens again, to bring her in earlier so as not to allow dehydrataion to become that advanced. Good to know.

As to where to got it, she told me she ate from a truck stop heat lamp food stash last Friday, because she was in a hurry, so hopefully she won't do that again.


Thank you for all the kind compliments, I really didn't think I went above and beyond in what I did, I just know that I love her and she needed some help cleaning up. I have decided to take everyone's advice here and since our door talk, act as if it never happened, which she is doing as well.

Also, to the people who asked, no, I do not work in the medical field, I work at a factory. I did however have a grandmother with Alzheimer's that lived with us when I was a teen, and I had to help clean her and take care of her, because my parents were too grossed out most of the time, and too cheap to get a live in nurse or something like that. I am not new to bodily fluids.

Anyways, thanks to everyone who advised me that she was just embarrased and I didn't do something out of turn. Also, thanks to everyone who showed concern about her health.

A few things first, I just wanna thank everyone who commented on my OP. I got overwhelmed with the amount of responses while on mobile (had no computer when I posted), and stopped replying, but I read every single comment and story. I've received a few PMs asking for an update and I'm sorry it's so late!


This update would be extremely long if I typed every single detail (and still is kinda long, whoops), so I'm gonna try and condense it. 


So, I sat my husband down the night he got home from work after posting my OP and we had a loooong talk. Again, this would be incredibly long if I wrote all the details so I'm gonna summarize and go in the order of my points I made in my OP. Keep in mind, our talk didn't follow the order of my post, so I'm sorry if anything seems confusing, since it would have been discussed out of order:


On not knowing when to pause playtime - I told him that I know he loves playing with the kids, and I love that he loves playing with the kids, but that I really need him to work with me during bedtime. I also once again pointed out that their lack of sleep is making them grumpy and harder to manage in the mornings, and that they're growing and need their sleep. He's had a couple slip-ups since, but he's cooled it down around bedtime now and makes more of an effort to help me with bedtime. He's started reading to them instead (I used to to it) and is 20 times better than me at it because they love the funny voices he gives the characters.


On discipline - I told him its not fair of him to constantly make me feel like the bad guy. And that no parent LIKES disciplining their kids, but they need it to learn and grow into good adults, and that I need him to be united with me on punishments. He's having a little trouble with this one, but has been trying more. Which I appreciate.


On breaking their toys - I, again, told him that I know he loves playing with our kids, but he needs to stop destroying their things. That not only is it upsetting them, but it's causing us to needlessly spending extra money to replace things that we don't need to be. I took this part of the talk to suggest we finally get a full sized trampoline like we had been talking about for a little while, and that he should dig out his bike from the garage so he can ride with our daughter when she learns. We're both probably more excited about the trampoline than the kids lol. We talked more about this topic, but these are the most relevant points. He realized he goes a little too far after I described the scene I wrote about in my OP, with him riding around on their little cars while the kids are standing on the sidelines. I'm also happy to report he has stayed off our daughters new bike.


On making the kids play when they don't want to - He agreed that it wasn't cool of him to push just because HE wants to play. I told him our kids are people, and just because they're kids, doesn't mean they don't deserve to have their boundaries respected or time to themselves.


And now on to the best friend thing - This was the first thing we discussed. Long story short, he was feeling hurt and generally having a little trouble accepting our daughter was growing up. This is really the first big thing shes done or said to show that she is, in fact, growing up. And he just wasn't expecting it and handling it very poorly, which he knew he did. I took a line from a comment on my OP and told him our children will have lots of best friends in their lifetime, but he will always be their only dad. This visibly comforted him, so thank you to whoever it was who wrote that. I took a suggestion from someone on the OP, and suggested that he call up his own parents and ask them for advice on how they handed watching 4 kids grow up and leave the nest. He really liked this idea and has since done so. I also showed him stories commenters on my OP shared about their relationship with their parents growing up. I told him that I'm not showing him them because I think he's going to become like those parents, but that I think it's important he see the children's side of things. These stories hit him pretty hard, which led into this:


So, I left something out of my OP that I didn't realize was relevant. Lots of people asked how my husbands relationship with his parents was growing up, and I answered that it was great. However, my own relationship with my parents was horrible. Long story short, I don't get along with nor even like my parents, and I see/talk to them maybe once a year. Growing up was miserable, to say the least. And it affected me for quite a long time where I was a huge ball of anger and resentment because of the way my parents treated me. I told my husband about all of this a few months after we started dating, so he was aware of everything from the start.


My husband told me he told himself he would be the best dad he could be, because he wanted our kids to have the childhood he knew I wanted, and wanted for them. Now, I started crying here and was a bit of a mess for a few minutes lol. It was honestly one of the most touching things anyone has ever said to me. I told him he *is* the best dad, and that I love him so much for it. Finding out that this was essentially the root of everything, it was a lot easier to continue on with the rest of my points.


Everything has been great since. He really listened to what I was saying this time, and has made a big effort to help me out more while also cooling it a bit with the kids. Him and our daughter have been riding around on their bikes together every weekend. I've also started learning how to ride so I can eventually join. Again, I wanna thank everyone for commenting on my OP and helping me gather my thoughts. I thought a few things said about my husband were a bit extreme, but I realize that's something that happens when people give advice on a situation they only have so much info on.

If I could afford to, I'd buy all of you ""GO TO COPS"" commenters a beer. Thank you all so so much. <3

After I posted, it sunk in what a big fucking deal this is. I broke down and gave everything to my boyfriend about 5 comments in. He was pissed, but fortunately I didn't even need to prove myself. He immediately jumped to overprotective boyfriend mode, and said we were turning my phone in. We called the non emergency line and I was instructed to take my phone to the sheriff's department ASAP and not to engage with Sean at all (not that I was, I'd stopped responding)

From there, my phone was taken and I probably won't be getting it back for a few more days so I couldn't really update immediately and I didn't really have much of one until today anyway. I don't want to give a bunch of information out for my own privacy, and also because I'm not supposed to, but Sean no longer has a way to contact me.

His phone, laptop, and his WIFE'S phone were taken when he was arrested today. Yeah, dumbshit is *married* with four damn kids. He's also been arrested for assault twice so I'm super thankful we went when we did. I don't know why exactly his wife's phone was taken, except the phone was also in his name. I was told it'd be at least a week before they could go through his computer or verify how got the images but as of right now he hasn't denied anything. 

So it's obvious this isn't something that's going to be over and done with by next week, but I'm not scared anymore. 

A lot of people were confused by the dick pics. My phone auto saves MMS, so I had a few from my boyfriend. Sean had sent them to me with pictures of his own (much smaller...) penis saying shit like he knew I ""preferred daddy's big cock."" Yeaaa ok. 

There was a lot of really nasty shit he sent me that I didn't want to hash out in my post, but I do feel really bad that my boyfriend had to be involved. I'm really disappointed in myself for not protecting him better but he doesn't care that the detective saw his junk or that Sean did, and said it could have just as easily happened to him and someone got my pics off his phone. 

My experience with the sheriff's department was honestly, awesome. I never felt like I was being judged and I was shocked because we live in a pretty small county with some pretty archaic ways of thinking. But it was fine. No one I had to speak with talked down to me, no one made it seem like my fault, nothing. Super respectful and genuinely tried to make me feel better about the whole thing. Even offered counseling services. Apparently this is SUPER common and something they end up dealing with when it gets really bad because people are afraid to tell anyone. 

And to clear up why my family wouldn't care and I wouldn't care if they saw them... They just wouldn't. I grew up in a very sex positive/open minded family. My uncle is gay and owns a drag bar. My aunt is trans. My mom did nude modeling in college. They will all be ready to kill this guy before being upset or embarrassed over my vanilla tit pics =/ I wouldn't send them out all willy-nilly but if Sean did post these online, and they recognize me, at most I'll get a, ""that lingerie doesn't work with your skin tone.""

246,CatBirthdayParty,Relationships,4yt4md,3060,"I've had my cat since he was 6 months old. He was an ""unadoptable"" rescue. He had so called unsurviveable pneumonia, and when healthy, was nothing but fear aggression. I was basically cat hospice. 

Well, he lived. And he loved. He's the purring-est, snuggliest, sweetest cat. He is now a chubby 16 year old with arthritis (treated with Dasuquin, which has helped immensely, but he's not a kitten anymore).

We used to live in a first floor apartment where we could sit outside and I could read and he could be on his tie out and watch birds. Now we don't anymore.

Shortly before his 16th birthday, he slipped and/or fell off the bathroom vanity. I didn't see it happen, I only saw the cat who couldn't stand without screaming afterwards. We rushed him to the vet and miraculously nothing was broken, but that left the question of what he DID do. Even in a bad sprain, it may always be weak and he may never walk normally again, or walk at all. If he tore a tendon or ligament, it was basically over. Orthopedic surgeries and senior cats don't usually end well. 

For a week and a half, we brought him food and water. We gave him his pain meds. We set him in the litter and held him up. We lifted him onto and off of the bed. It was basically a cat nursing home up in here. 

Just when we thought he would never get up again, he did exactly that. Then he walked a few steps. Then it was cat PT. Making him go a little further every day. Getting his strength back up.

A month later, aside from sitting over on one hip when he sits, you would never know he had ever been hurt.

For his 16th, I loaded him into the car (which he doesn't mind at all) and took him to a park by the lake. He spent a couple hours watching ducks and warming his old bones in the sun. 

My boyfriend was indignant. How the cat doesn't even know it's his birthday, what a waste of time, who does that, etc etc. 

No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys. He knows he feels better than he had been. He knows those things. 

Now it's 3 months later and my BF is STILL on about cat birthday outings. Idgi. He helped care for him when,he was injured and did probably more than I did, because I work 10 hour shifts. So I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is? I mean, there's whole parks devoted to dogs where dogs can see their dog friends. So what's weird about taking a cat out for one afternoon? He's really starting to make me feel like shit about it.

247,voidhearts,Non-Romantic,56sgxk,3051,"I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom. 

Background: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood. 

The media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. 

A couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's ""just shooting a video, not that hard"". I declined, so he asked me if I could ""shoot a music video for him"" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. 

I hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded ""Alright"". 

The following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. 

At first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. 

During the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes ""the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model"". 

Okay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was ""left open"" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. 

So I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my ""mess"" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. 

Fast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has ""two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera"" and she ""doesn't know where it is or what he did with it"". 

At this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. 


**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.

Edit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:

Among other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  

Edit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. 

I've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. 

There's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one).

249,DiaryThrowawayy,Personal issues,4r6euw,3044,"Posting this in personal issues because so far it feels more like a personal issue to me. 

Yesterday afternoon I came home from work early because I wasn't feeling well. I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged. 

Eventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary. 

He said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me. 

My thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this. Writing in my diary was one of the only things I had left and now it's been taken from me. I've been so sad I can't even process it. 

I don't know reddit. Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I'm overreacting and I'm sure that's what you're thinking right now. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world. I used to have so many friends and hobbies and I feel like since getting married things have changed so much. My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive. 

I can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back. 

I just needed to vent I guess. If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Would you consider this a major breech of privacy or no big deal? Do you think I'm depressed ? :(

I was distraught, knowing what tinder is and what it is used for, I was heartbroken. 

She goes on to tell me that his Bio says he's ""Looking to make some new, exciting and fun friends and looking to hangout. Willing to travel a little if there's enough excitement involved!""

His pictures do not include me, despite 9/10 pictures ever taken of either of us for the last three years having the two of us together in them. One of his pictures is him at the beach, shirtless and a tiny man thong I got him as a joke. He cropped me out of the image.

I brought this up to him, and he laughed it off, saying that 1: my best friend of 11 years is a 'nosy bitch' and that 2: he's entitled to seek friends and be social, even if it is with complete strangers. Basically he completely invalidated my points and made *me* feel guilty for being upset by this, playing it off like I am being possessive. 

Since then I've avoided bringing it up and just tried to get over it. He hasn't been out and about any more than usual so it doesn't look like he has any 'takers' yet, but this is just *not* sitting right with me. I'm upset and feeling betrayed, and I don't know how to put my point across without him invalidating it or guilting me.

**TL;DR: Boyfriend of 3yrs using a notorious dating and casual sex/hookup app to ""look for friends"" with suspicious bio and pics.**

Edit: Firstly, thank all of you for all of your perspectives and advice in this quite frankly disgusting situation I've found myself in.

I decided I'd play dirty as someone suggested and made a tinder profile, pretending to be a friend (with her permission!) whom he does not know. I hit on him. He reciprocated and made plans to meet with 'me' at a nearby coffee shop that we occasionally date at, minutes after making 'my' intentions clear. Wow.

In about 20 minutes he'll be headed out to go and meet 'me' and I'll be packing up his shit ready for him to leave when he gets back. House is my families, he has no rights to any of it.

I deserve better.

Edit/Update 2:

He sat at the coffee place waiting for 'her/me' for over an hour in the hopes to meet my, to be honest, gorgeous friend. Obviously she didn't show up.

Shortly after he left I called my dad to explain, and I must have sounded pretty distraught because he came over without me asking. Dave came home to his clothes packed up by the door. He came in yelling ""what the fuck is this?"" and, unbeknownst to him, my dad was sat by me on the sofa and responded on my behalf, telling him in no certain words to get his filthy unfaithful ass out of his house. I am glad he did. I think my dad knows I'm timid and prone to being pushed about.

His face dropped when he pieced it together and without a word he 180'd and grabbed his bags. I know he has places he can stay, and family nearby, so I'm not worried about him having no place to sleep. 

This is going to hurt for a long time, but I can never forgive that kind of breach of trust. I'm not the type of person to move past it. I'll allow him back to collect his pieces of furniture and such in a week or so when he is situated, but that's as far as seeing him again goes. I am also dreading a phone call from his mother, whom I love dearly. She'll be heartbroken too.

My husband played baseball in college. It was his dream to be a professional baseball player. He was able to play in the minors for a short period of time but was eventually cut. After this, he went to a foreign country to play for a few years. About a year and a half ago, he ?retired,? moved back to the states, and got an office job. 

In the meantime, I went to law school, graduated, passed the bar, and got a relatively high paying job. I like what I do and, while I don?t know if I want to do this forever, I have no plans of changing jobs anytime soon. 

Yesterday, Adam told me that he was thinking about going to a different foreign country (with lower standards) to revive his baseball career. He wants me to come with him. 

I did not react well, I?ll admit that. I laughed and asked if he was joking and, when it became clear that he wasn?t, got super pissed. I spent a lot of time and money building my career. I?m honestly insulted that he wants me to give it up. 

He says that I could always take a few years off and come back to it when he finishes playing baseball. I argue that I won?t be a particularly desirable candidate to a law firm after taking years off of work. He says I could try to work as a consultant at a foreign firm or at an American firm?s office in that particular country. This would involve changing the area of law that I practice. I practice the type of law that I do because I like it and am good at it. I don?t know if I could be happy practicing in a different area or if I could even get a job with no experience. 

He thinks I?m being unsupportive and has threatened to go regardless of whether I agree to come with. I think he?s being delusional. I know this is harsh and I would never say it like this to him but he tried this and failed twice. Why would he put himself through that again?  If he doesn?t like his current job and wants to do something else, that?s fine. I will support a career change. But I will absolutely not give up my job to chase a dream that will likely never pan out. I know it?s his dream but most people don?t actually get to do their dream job. I feel like he needs to grow up. 

I?m sorry if this comes off as insensitive. I am just so frustrated. I?m looking for any advice about how to tackle this problem. Do I let him go on his own? Do I put my foot down?

252,LittleMissPotatoe,Non-Romantic,c6uni2,3038,"My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn?t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. 

Over the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. 

Back to my father?s death (a seven month bout with illness). 

Nearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn?t have anything if I didn?t. No one reciprocated, but I didn?t expect it. Honestly, I didn?t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because ?no one loved him? and it would prove that I ?cared.? It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. 

I?ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom?s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he ?get me? for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. 

I have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he?s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won?t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he?s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won?t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is ?the Devil? in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. 

I have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son?s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.

Now that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I?ve had people who can?t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am ?neglecting? my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don?t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that ?I wouldn?t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn?t work for an employer like that.? Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, ?Who do you think cared for you as a baby?? and, honestly this one gets to me, ?Sometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can?t just ignore it.??because ?dealing with life? includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? 

You can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be ?as long as she needed.? I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a ?right to be near her friends.? I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don?t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor?s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler?s bedtime. This wasn?t an emergency. She wanted to ?look around.?). 

My mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn?t ?want me to lose my job,? a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she?s given my brother everything). 

I am at my breaking point. 

I can?t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked ?Why do you even try anymore?? (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. 

Today, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor?s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor?s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.

I can?t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father?s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at ?dealing with life,? she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can?t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. 

Nothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever
will be. 

TL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions. 

(1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him). All-in-all, I don?t want to lose my job or find another one. It?s a good job, just one confined by the limits of being a small company.

(2) She has refused: moving in with me by either my husband and I building a mother-in-suite or moving to bigger home; any assisted care facilities or nursing homes; moving closer. She has flip-flopped on whether she will allow home care but contradicts herself on this point, telling me ?insert name? can help her if she needs anything or she has ?friends? she can call or, most common, that she ?does fine? and can care for herself. She wants assistance but only *when* she wants it and only on her own terms. 

(3) She told me she will not cut ties with my brother. I? was able to get her to agree to counseling after my brother assaulted her, stole her car, and pawned *all* of her appliances. She moved into a domestic violence shelter, yet she refused to press charges. This occurred when I was going on seven months pregnant and when I refused to travel 20+ hours in a car, I was told essentially the same thing I am being accused of now. 

(4) She excuses my brother?s behavior. He has ?got in with the Devil? and she ?can?t abandon him.? I have spoken with counselors, Adult Protective Services, and it boils down to, she?s an adult, she can make her own decisions. Her doctors, although they seem to agree she could use help taking care of herself, have refused to state she lacks the capacity to care for herself.",1561783765.0,"My family expects me (30F) to leave my family (and small child) indefinitely and move across county to care for my mother (66F), and I don?t know how to react.

I was initially going to see my Sami just a few days after I found out what happened, but canceled on him. I took the weekend to think, talk to a few friends & read over the comments to my original post. After a bit of thinking, I decided to break up with him. Sami lied to me, lied to our mutual friend Lauren, covered up for cheating, and knew full well that his friend Jon was having sex with multiple girls and doing it ""raw"". He basically decided his friendship with a cheater was more important than Lauren being exposed to STDs. That was the deal breaker.

I called Sami on Tuesday and asked him to meet up with me in a public place. When we got there, I told him what Lauren had told me. He initially denied, denied, denied. But I think he could see from the look on my face that I wasn't about to be fooled. He literally looked me in the eyes and said, ""To be honest, wouldn't it be worse if I was the kind of pussy who didn't cover for his friends? Don't you want a man who is loyal?""

God help me, I was upset talking to him but he said that I burst out laughing. What he was saying was just so ridiculous but he said it as though he was a martyr. I stopped laughing after a second but the look on his face changed completely. He leaned in and said ""You stupid bitch, you think Jon was the only one fucking around?""

He's never cussed at me before or said anything with so much anger, especially not with the intent to hurt me, but for some reason I just didn't care. I thought so little of him at that moment that his opinion didn't matter to me. It was actually kind of a comfort that he said that to me because it proves that he's a fuckboy. ""When people show you who they are, believe them.""

So I just got up and left. I picked up Chipotle then went home and watched ""Making a Murderer"". A few hours later I called Lauren and explained to her everything that happened. She comforted me then advised me to get tested for STDs immediately. She ended up coming with me for support to get tested and then a week later I got the results that I'm clean (and so is Lauren btw).

And that was that.

254,MarriedABaby,Relationships,4dmdc2,3029,"Reddit, please help me. I'm at my wits end.

This is going to read like ""we see what we want to see"" but I assure you that's not the case. My husband and I have been married a bit over a year, we were together for 4 before that. Not long distance, normal relarionship, moved in together at around the 2 year mark.

He was damn close to perfect. Really he was. Even after the honeymoon phase wore off, damn close to perfect. 

Here's the guy I married:

Attentive, sensual and comfortable with his sexuality, brave, honorable, honest, communicated well, respectfully told me when he took issue with something I had done and accepted criticism gracefully when I was upset with him, then we worked out the issue together and it STAYED fixed. A great mix of social and alone time - he didn't want to go out to much or stay in too much which was great for me because I'm very introverted with a touch of social anxiety. Nothing too bad, I'm just one of those people who never wants to go out.... then has a blast when I get there. He had a great job and goals and we were planning a great future. He was supportive of my career development (I was a late starter, went to college late). He was proud of me and always walked around like a preening peacock with me in public. We were That Couple, guys. 

His ONLY faults were that he sometimes did what his mother wanted, even when it was more than a little unreasonable, but we set some boundaries with her and that got better, and he could be a little scatterbrained/inconsiderate in the way of he wouldn't ASK me about plans, he would TELL me the day before. I fixed that one by saying he was welcome to go alone, but if I made other plans and he hadn't told me, I was sticking with my other plans. 

Those are pretty minor things in the grand scheme of things.

All out friends told me I finally got it right, half of them would have happily dated him if we broke up. Not in a creepy way, just a ""You're super lucky, he's awesome, I've always had a little crush on him"" way.

And then we got married.

I have no ue who this man is anymore.

We nearly never have sex. He acts like he's asexual. Before, it was sexts and jumping me as soon as I walked in the door. Now its one position, with the lights off, once every 2 or 3 weeks. It's like he's self conscious and afraid of sex now. He stopped communicating. He hates everything about me. I'm Buddhist, he's agnostic, but he used to be interested in what I had to say about my beliefs. Very interested. I never tried to convert him, it's just a part of my life I value. He used to love intellectual and philosphical discussions about Buddhism, now he just tunes out or says ""ok"". That's his go to for anything. My needs, my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns, my likes and dislikes are all met with ""ok"". 

We never go out anymore. I mean NEVER. I still sometimes go to events with friends, he isn't interested. 

He quit his job without telling me because he ""hated it"" and took a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. This was like a $40k yr PAY CUT. There is no money for the training and class I need for my career. But yet he finds money for his collectibles and whatever he wants. If I ask, he says it's my problem. I need to fund my own advancement. Which would be right, to a point, except it would advance US. And he HAD been helping. He had agreed to continue to.

He does nothing around the house anymore. I was away for 4 days and came home to find stale food in the cat's dishes that had sat there since I left and they had no water. The younger is half Siamese and he was yowling anf going stir crazy because he hadn't been played with. He used to adore those cats and snuggle and play with them all the time. No laundry was done. There was a sink full of dishes. 

The mommy issue is back. She says jump and he asks how high. Period. He spends entire days with her morning to night for days in a row. She has no health issues, this isn't a caregiver situation. When I've talked to him about it he says I don't ""understand"" what it's like to have family (I'm NC with my abusive mother, my father passed when I was 11, I have a brother who lives in another country). It feels personal. Like he rubs my nose in his family.

He's no longer a gentlemen. He no longer has my back and stands up for me. We have jerkwad neighbors who leave crap in our yard, are loud and obnoxious, and just generally assholes. One day I got in an argument with one of them because they were having a party and PARKING IN OUR DRIVEWAY and where my BF would have shown a united front, my HUSBAND told me to ""stop being hormonal"", looked at the neighbor and said ""You know how women are"" and HAD A BEER with him.

Reddit, I don't know this guy and I don't like him. Is this who he really is? I LIVED with him for 2 years and saw none of this. I wouldn't have married this asshole. He makes me feel like shit about myself and like I'm less than. I feel like I have a bratty teenager and not a husband. 

But yet I saw nearly none of this. Like I said, just 2 minor issues. He was amazing. And now that I'm married to him I don't know him. Can someone really fake a personality 24/7 for 2 years? So well that none of their true self bleeds through? I don't want to spend my life with someone who hates me and everything about me, who is either zoned in front of the computer or at moms, who acts like I'm dipped in shit when I try to touch him. I wouldn't have married that guy. I thought I married an adult partner.

We got into counseling not too long after that post and have been continuing every week ever since.  We just had a session yesterday.  Our counselor is wonderful, she really understands the situation and has identified the struggle my husband faces when confronted with an uncomfortable topic, like our losses, stress at work, the decision to have children or not, and more.

We have spent quite a long time discussing my husband's upbringing.  His family isn't really big on communicating, and there are many problems that he and his siblings have had over the years (and continue to this day) that were never addressed and never resolved.  In session he talked about how he felt his emotional needs were never really met growing up, but that he didn't realize it until now.  It made me really sad for him.  We had his parents over a few weeks ago and as usual, the conversation remained really superficial and never delved into anything very substantial.  I have tried to share with them about our life and our losses before, but there's never been any sign of interest from them in connecting with us in that way, even though his mother is one of the only people I know in my life who has suffered a loss as well.  We spent the next week's session processing their visit, and unfortunately my husband felt a lot of anger and frustration that he wasn't able to talk to them about the important stuff.

However, in our relationship things have completely transformed.  We argue so much less, and he is completely present and there for me when I need his support.  The topic of having children has come back up, and we are still figuring that out, but we can really talk about it and be open and honest with each other without fear and with respect and open arms for each other.  He has repeatedly said that he's really happy we got into therapy and that he feels great about the state of our relationship.  I'm almost happy we've gone through such hard times so that we were able to hit rock bottom and get to this wonderful place.

257,TheSweatyCheese,Non-Romantic,bjhxpk,3001,"My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT.

My mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.

Backstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her ""last dollars"" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I ""wanted"".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.

The first time I told her about the wedding, she said, ""I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!"" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my ""special day"". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  ""Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!"" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos.

I started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one. 

Here's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list.

I'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???

I know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout.

When I made my original post, I was feeling at an impasse and thinking I was going to end a relationship I valued, only because our sex life was starting to slacken.  Initial responses were confirming this fear ""oh you have a dead bedroom... bail on that""


Then I got a few comments about our poor communication, which I kindof knew... but also about how my perception of what my GF was saying she wanted (being taken) was in fact me being stubborn about what I thought it would make me to fulfill that role for her.  


I think, being my age, I get prone to thinking I know a lot.. but in some aspects, I'm as stupid/innocent about things as it can get.  


Prior to the post, I was pretty strict about ""anytime someone utters no, that is full stop"".  I haven't changed the spirit of this - but the comments also lead me to understand that sometimes knowing that you drive a person so crazy they just can't keep their paws off you, lead me to realize I do in fact feel that way about my GF - and that I was intentionally suppressing something that she likely really wanted to feel.


Since the post, the next time we went out, I intentionally was oogling her and telling her ways I was attracted to how she was behaving, looking.  I also took a quick second to tell her that I've been thinking about our bedroom issues and that I decided upon a safe word that she could use later if needed... I told her the word, then went back to smirking at her as I looked her up and down and... she was just radiant about it.  She lit up with smiles and I literally could just tell I had said exactly the right thing to her.  


I'm a ""physical touch"" person and I just notice when she gives more than not - but her contact frequency with me has been outstanding since then (it had dwindled).  Our bedroom situation has shifted to zero complaints for me as well - but our general connection just seems to be a complete reverse from where I felt it was.


I don't think my original post gained much attention, but I wanted to post an update to thank those who took the time to respond and help me out.  This literally took the best possible direction for me - better than I had hoped for in fact.  It wouldn't have been possible without those who took time to respond.


As for me, I already knew there are things I'm ignorant about, but it was another good lesson to realize I can be a stubborn asshole and become too entrenched without realizing it.  The next time I feel like I'm facing an impossible issue with someone I care about, that is going to be one of the first things I take a serious look at.


As people had pointed out, she was telling me what she wanted (if not 100% direct, she was communicating it).  I also think she wasn't listening to me either - but there was enough there to align us back together to where now I'm very happy with us again.

Okay, so I was not expecting this much attention or advice, so thank you to everyone who took the time to help me out. The major consensus was that I was NOT over-reacting (I really didn't think I was either!!) and that Ali's behaviour was not cool.

So, Rick and I were hanging out last night, and I took the advice of /u/cold08 and, at a suitable time, asked him how HE feels when Ali's sitting on his lap, etc. and if he would feel comfortable telling me what's going on in his head at those times. He told me (exasperatedly) that nothing goes on in his head since they are just friends and he doesn't know what else to tell me (shocker). I mentioned that I had made this post. He asked to see it. I thought it might make him see things more clearly, that her behaviour is inappropriate, but he actually got angry...(we've never really fought before). 

I think he was upset because he knew he was wrong. But basically he was like ""so, what now? I can't be friends with her anymore? I can't have any female friends because you're threatened?"" I explained I'm not threatened persay, and I would never ask him to de-friend anyone, but I feel disrespected when she does these things and asked if he'd be willing to ask her to back down a bit. 

Well, he broke down and told me that he had lied to me. They have slept together before (numerous times, mostly while drunk at parties, etc). And there are underlying feelings (SHOCKER). He says he doesn't have them for her, but she's expressed hers to him before. He says he isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with her at all, but she does get jealous and tries to mark her territory. Apparently, this has caused issues in previous relationships (on both sides) and he DOES know it's a problem. But he does not want to hurt her feelings because she's sensitive (the fuck?).

Basically, I broke up with him after that. Not only was I PISSED that he blatantly lied to my face about anything happening between them, but he put her before me anyways by refusing to cut back her inappropriate behaviour or telling her to stop. And I don't think he ever would've put me first anyways. I told him I refuse to be anyone's second choice, and did not want be put in between this drama. I also told him he needs to figure his shit out otherwise he's going to fuck up every good relationship he has. He tried to beg me not to go, but fuck that shit. 

I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm SO PISSED OFF and seriously want to go punch this stupid bitch in the face, and maybe kick him in balls too, but, since life doesn't work that way, here I am. 7 months wasted, but lesson learned. I'm going to my friend's for wine night tonight, and I'm going to have a good fucking time. I'm annoyed that she ""wins"" in a way now, but, I deserve better so...bye felicia.

Thanks again to everyone for their advice, it's much appreciated and made me realize a lot of things I didn't see. So thank you for that :)

**tl;dr**: I broke up with him. 

Long version: Thank you all for your comments. It helped me get from the sad and confused stage to the angry stage. The final straw was finding *his* post he made about half a year ago, talking about breaking up with me when I was in a very hurt and vulnerable state. 

I then spent two nights at my sister's place to clear my head and told her about everything and she was shocked and disgusted and we talked for hours and it was all really freeing. I then decided to break it off with Jack. Jack and I lived together but the apartment was rented in his name, and I just always gave him my half of the rent. So I hired a moving truck and got all my important stuff when he was at work yesterday and left a note that said: Congratulations. Our relationship is now ~~open~~ over. I felt bad for not having the courage to tell him face to face but honestly, I just didn't even want to face him even for one minute. 

He kept calling me non-stop yesterday and leaving lots of messages, some of them saying how much he misses me and loves me, some of them saying how glad he is that it's over and how he has been cheating on me for the past year. No idea if that's true. I'm staying at my sister's for now and looking for a new apartment. I'm still sad and angry but thinking about Jack coming home to a half empty apartment (without a bed, that one was mine) makes me smile. Thanks again, internet strangers, you really opened my eyes!

261,km524,Relationships,6yocwx,2984,"Fair warning that this is going to be a pretty long post, but if any of you are willing to read and give me some clarity and insight on my situation, it means the absolute world to me. 


My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years now. We bought a house together and moved in about 7 months ago & recently adopted a dog also. I genuinely believe we are both deeply in love with each other and if there were soulmates out there, we easily could be each others. He is very affectionate and sensitive and honestly my best friend. I can talk to him about anything & everything and we have so much fun together. Even his friends have said they?ve never seen him so in love before me and vice versa with my friends. This is what makes my judgement of him and our current situation so damn foggy and distorted and I don?t know what to do anymore.


About 2 1/2 years into our relationship, I went through his phone for the first time ever. I have never condoned going through a SO?s phone & have always been against it. However, it was 4 AM, I was drunk, and he was dead asleep so I stupidly went through it. Long story short, I found two conversations he had with two different girls, one from high school & another from Tinder, basically trying to hook up with them and saying he didn?t have a girlfriend. The conversations only lasted like a week or two and unfortunately I was too drunk to remember if the conversations went further as far as planning to meet, but regardless, I was obviously devastated and shocked.


I confronted him and he explained that nothing ever happened and he never met up with them. His reason for texting those other girls was that he was ?doubting? us and our relationship. I remember looking back at our texts during the time he was texting these girls, and we were totally fine, not fighting or anything, and he had been acting totally normal. Whatever it was, it crushed me. 


Ever since i can remember I have had some serious body image issues that I tend to hide pretty well. I developed a eating disorder when I was about 15 and have had disordered eating habits and body image anxieties ever since. I am not nearly as extreme as I once was in my teenage and early 20?s, but I still struggle with the need to be in control of my eating and always have the daunting fear of never being good enough. There will always be women out there who are better than me, prettier, more artistic, more outgoing, with a better ass and more sex appeal, the list of ?betters? never ends. I am well aware of how irrational this type of thinking is but unfortunately I can?t stop thinking in such a way. I?ve never been very open about my eating disorder or body image problems besides with therapists, because it?s not something that needs to be shared. Hell, it?s pretty much the norm these days for woman to hate themselves, what makes my issues any different?

The point is that any girlfriend would be devastated to find out her boyfriend was texting other woman, but for someone like me, I feel like my entire being and spirit was crushed and officially confirmed that I really will never be good enough.


I decided to give my BF another chance but also knew that if I did stay with him, I couldn?t hang this over his head forever, so I didn?t. However, the trust I had in him was pretty much gone and I have been very insecure with our relationship and can?t help but feel anxious and paranoid whenever he goes out with just the guys. 


Fast forward a year and a half later to now, our relationship has come a long way since that entire incident occurred and we had bought a house and moved in together. I had not looked through his phone since the first time until a few weeks ago. I have no idea what motivated me to look through it again, but my gut must have been telling me something. 


I found a few texts from the night before from a woman whose name I didn?t recognize. My BF texted her asking if she made it out of work on time, she replied ?yes, almost at the restaurant?, he responded that he would be there by 6. She texted him the next morning thanking him for coming out, he replied saying he had a great time and don?t forget to text him when she returns from vacation with a wink face. Awesome. 


The night they had dinner, he had called me around 5 as I was leaving my office to let me know he just got home to shower and would feed our dog and would be home later as he was going to his parents house to finish working on the bathroom he?s fixing for them. What a perfectly executed alibi. I reverse looked up the woman?s phone number on Whitepages and discovered it was a 50 year old woman, who happened to be the mom of a girl I knew through a mutual friend. My heart sank. I texted our mutual friend and asked about the girl?s mom and she confirmed that she?s a single mom and dating a young guy is definitely something she would do, and is always trying to act younger and party with her kids. 


I then looked through his recent browser history and saw that he had recently looked up erotic massage parlors in the area, as well as watches a ton of porn. The porn really doesn?t bother me, I?m a pretty sexual person and watch it by myself also. But erotic massage parlors? That?s just sketchy and weird.  Finding all of this at once made me feel so sick to my stomach, I felt like he had some other life I didn?t know about or a sex addiction. I didn?t know what to think. 


I finally confronted my BF and could barely look at him I was so confused and creeped out. I told him that I?m looking for an apartment and that I feel like I don?t even know who he is anymore. He said he did not cheat on me and never ever has.


 One of his very close friends from work that he?s known for a long time has been battling cancer for the past 3 years, but it always seemed like he was going to beat it. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst in early August and he was put in hospice. My BF explained that he was so upset and messed up emotionally from the bad news that he just does stupid things like this for no reason because he doesn?t know how to cope and talk about his emotions. He pleaded for me not to move out and that he had no intentions of even going to those massage parlors or hooking up with that older woman and that she had approached him and asked for his business card at Home Depot randomly. He didn?t even know why he agreed to dinner and all he talked about with her was his friend. 


I distanced myself from him for a few days and kept emphasizing that I can?t do this again and will not allow myself to get hurt again. After countless talks, I decided to give him a last chance. At this point, his friend had days left to live and he needed love and support more than ever, so I decided to trust his word that he is the man I fell in love with. Sadly, his friend passed last week and I had never seen him so upset in my life so I put my pride away and was there for him. However, my trust for him is pretty much nonexistent at this point. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it?s been so badly damaged? I honestly have felt like I?m on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the anxiety and paranoia I have about whether he?s lying or not. I am so lost.

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 4 years broke my trust 2 years ago by texting other girls (claims nothing physical ever happened) when I looked through phone for first time. Gave him a second chance & we have been better than ever since, until 2 weeks ago I looked through his phone for a second time & found out he had been looking up erotic massage parlors and went on a date with a 50 yr old woman. One of his close work friends is in hospice, and he claims that he did those stupid things because he was messed up emotionally and upset over his friend and doesn?t know how to cope with his emotions. Sick to my stomach and so lost. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it?s been so badly damaged?

It's been 7 months and I'm happy to say I have officially quit, my last day is next week. I dwindled my days down to 2 and have recently started training at my new job the remainder of the week.


I developed alopecia and started losing my hair from the stress. I was not going to allow this woman to take my hair along with my sense of self worth.


The news went better than expected when I explained I was leaving. Of course I didn't tell her my true reasoning, I cited somewhat truths to keep her happy and my side gig secured with her. 
She offered a huge raise and other benefits, but nothing could keep me there, minus her pressence.  She said I was irreplaceble. Too late for praise now, maybe you should have treated me with respect. I didn't say this, though I wanted to, oh how I wanted to. 

2 decades of stress, anxiety , and being talked down to by my boss is officially coming to an end and I have the very kind redditors who messaged me and responded with words of encouragement to thank. Some of you offered to help me write a resume and some even offered me a job. If I could hug you guys I would, I'm truly that grateful. 

My poor replacement is already feeling her wrath. I have warned her and told her to not allow herself to be a doormat. She's young, so I'm worried she's a bit naive, as was I and will accept the abuse. ?

I was offered a job as soon as I mentioned wanting to quit to a friend. I have benefits and work in a laid back atmosphere where I'm adjusting to not working under a narcissistic , bullying dictator. I'm learning I don't have to apologize constantly over the smallest mistakes to my new boss to keep them calm and happy. It's absolutely refreshing. 


Thank you.

263,koumorinobi,Non-Romantic,4isc42,2973,"Hi, r/relationships! This is a repost because I messed up a few of the details + I posted this in the middle of the night and didn't get much of a response.

My fiance: Charlie

My sister: Kendall

Kendall's boyfriend: Jack


**BACKGROUND INFO**

Charlie and I have been together for six years and have lived together for three years. We met in college. Our relationship is *awesome*. I love him more than anything and I know he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. We're best friends, we make a great team, and we're really happy together. So no problems there.

Kendall and I have always been close. We've had normal sisterly arguments and whatnot, but I love her and she's family. I don't really know Jack that well, but he seemed like a nice guy (which obviously isn't the case), and we've all gotten along until now.

Kendall and Jack have been together for two years. Their relationship is rocky; Kendall has called me countless times because of fights, breakups, and drama. I've always been her shoulder to cry on and I've supported her through everything as best I can. 

She has gotten jealous of my relationship with Charlie, saying things like she wishes she could have a ""perfect"" relationship like ours and she wishes she could have that connection with Jack. Recently (within the last two months), she's started saying things like ""I should just steal Charlie from you"" and ""I wish Jack was more like Charlie, I think Charlie and I would be a great match."" She started flirting with Charlie (which made him super uncomfortable) and overstepped boundaries. I was uncomfortable and upset with her behavior, we had a serious talk and she broke down. She told me she was going through a rough patch with Jack and wasn't handling it well. She apologized (to me and to Charlie) and told me she knew what she did was wrong, it wouldn't happen again, etc. Charlie and I talked about it and we decided to forgive her.

At the time of the incident, Jack and Kendall were still going through a rough patch.

**THE INCIDENT**

Two weeks ago, Charlie invited close friends and family to dinner (this included Jack and Kendall). It was at the restaurant Charlie and I had our first date, down to the exact table we sat at. We had talked about marriage (at great length), so I had a feeling.

Lo and behold, Charlie proposed to me. It was perfect, I was so happy. I cried like a baby, lol.

Our family and friends congratulated us. Kendall seemed super excited. She gushed about how cute it was, started talking about the wedding, and hugged us both. 

The only person who didn't seem happy for us was Jack. He told Kendall that he wanted to go home and they left early.

Fast forward a few days. Kendall texted me and she was pissed. She called me ""a dirty traitor"" and ""a disgusting cunt."" I was like wtf??? I asked her why she was upset. She claimed I was trying to ruin her relationship and then stopped replying to my texts.

I texted Jack and asked him wtf was going on. He told me that he was planning to propose to Kendall at dinner. At first, I felt bad because maybe he had planned something beforehand and maybe it was just a huge misunderstanding. But apparently, Jack wasn't even planning to propose to Kendall until we got to the restaurant. He saw how nice the restaurant was, our friends and family were there, and decided ""hey, this is perfect."" He thought it would help them out of their rough patch (which is a horrible idea because marriage doesn't magically fix relationships), but then Charlie proposed and ""stole his thunder."" He didn't even have a ring!

Charlie had been planning that proposal for *months*. He's had the ring for six months, made the reservations two months beforehand, invited all of our family and friends. Even the staff of the restaurant was in on the proposal! He put a lot of thought into it and I don't think Jack's heat of the moment decision to propose is more important than Charlie's carefully planned proposal. I'm actually upset that Jack would make something this special and important into something dramatic and all about him.

I didn't apologize. Charlie and I talked about it, he agrees and doesn't think we should apologize.

**THE AFTERMATH**

Since then, Kendall and Jack haven't talked to us. Which is fine by itself, but that's not the end of it. Both of them have been shaming us on social media, twisting the story to make themselves look like victims, and have even coined us ""The Proposal Thieves."" 

Mutual friends (and even some family!) are disgusted with us. They believe Jack and Kendall's story, even after I've tried to explain what really happened. As funny as it is to be called The Proposal Thieves, it's not so funny to have friends and family turned against you. I'm really upset that my own sister would do this.

Charlie has been super supportive and sweet through this mess. We both agree that we shouldn't apologize and have been standing our ground. 

Honestly, after everything Kendall has done, I'm pretty much fed up with her. She's my sister and I love her, but after she tried to seduce my boyfriend and now this, I don't really have a desire to talk to her anymore. Which sucks, because we've always been close. I think Jack has turned her into this horrible, self-absorbed person and it's just.. ugh. 

Btw, I'm **not** talking to Kendall right now and have no plans to talk to her until we receive a sincere apology. Even then, I think I might limit contact if she stays with Jack.

What do you think, Reddit? What should we do? How should we handle this? Advice/perspective/anything???

**EDIT**: Thank you for all of the advice! I will **definitely** post an update after we make our post explaining the situation. I really, really appreciate all of the help and support. It means a lot! :) I can't wait to see what a mess actually planning the wedding will be, lmao. See you guys in a week or two!

**EDIT #2**: **JUST TO CLARIFY!** The people who believe Jack and Kendall's story are the ones who were **not** at the proposal dinner! A large amount of mutual friends who weren't there + extended family believe the story. Our parents, Charlie's siblings, and the few close friends that were actually at the dinner **do not** believe the bullshit story. We just haven't made a post addressing everything/telling our side of the story because we wanted advice on how to approach it (which is why I posted here).

TL;DR: Sister and bf are upset that we ""upstaged them."" Spreading lies on social media. Everything is a mess, please help?

Other than that, please refrain from contacting his mother or sister and not call me or message me unless it's an emergency. I told him that for years he's been draining his family, his baby sister hates him, his mother is broken and I gave up at 12:30 sitting at that cafe yesterday.

I want to thank all of you for your comments and support; they made me realize really how shitty of a relationship I was in.  I did return home from my business trip, and after another physical incident, I said that was enough.  I called my parents (who are awesome), and my dad (who is awesome) came and helped me to safely get out.  We were even able to get my car out (its in only my name, and the lease is held by a major bank).  Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now.  In hindsight I should have gotten out *way* sooner, but hindsight is a bitch.

During this process, the tribal courts and tribal police were way more helpful than I had expected.  A distant cousin of my spouse in the court actually helped us by writing a letter which would have compelled access to my car (and how to work the system), even though civil matters weren't his area and the obvious relationship.  (We didn't end up officially using the letter since we couldn't get is signed by a judge in time). The police were very understanding, and felt my request was extremely reasonable, and they did everything they could do to make sure the retrieval went smoothly.

So after an over-night stay in a major PNW city, getting the car to a transport service, and a cross-country flight, I am safely with my parents now.  It's not the house I grew up in, but it still feels like home.  And by the way, my boss and his boss are fantastic.  They have been nothing but understandable and willing to work with me so far, and that is absolutely fantastic.

So now I begin the process of rebuilding.  I'm going to focus on me, and do things I want to do which I know I wil enjoy.  I *will* rebuild myself financially and emotionally (my spouse subtly and not so subtly siphoned off resources by not having much free cash of his own, since he kept buying shit), and I will rebuild relationships which have frayed either due to alienation or distance.  Friends I have already talked to have been nothing but supportive, and I have warned them my spouse might try to manipulate them to get to me.

What about my spouse you may be wondering?  Well, as soon as he realized that I had left his parents' house, turned off a family locator app, and was not answering his calls, he tried to guilt his way back to me.  He supposedly had a nervous breakdown, and was admitted to a local hospital off reservation.  When I landed last night there were messages from him that he had moved to the psych ward at a larger regional hospital, that he was going to try and get money back to me that I had given him for closing costs on the home purchase, and that he was sorry.  While if that is really the case, I'm sorry it happened that way, but I have the closure I need, and from now on I need to focus on myself.

Hey guys I got some really good feedback to my post that made talking to my girlfriend a lot easier and I'm so happy so I thought I owed those posters an update!

After reading all the comments and reflecting on our relationship I decided the recent lack of sex was not the problem but just the symptom of a much greater issue, my girlfriend's stress. Like I said in the original post, I was weary to bring these issues up because I did not want to add additional stress to my girlfriend's situation, she has enough to worry about right now.

I had mentioned that weekends are her least busy times and that is when we get things done around the house and hang out with friends. Some users said we should focus less on being social and more on ourselves, and someone else suggested that I try to get more done during the week so we can relax more on the weekend. So on Thursday and Friday I got up early and did everything we needed to do this weekend, cleaned the whole house, did our meal prep (something we usually do Saturday) and got all the laundry taken care of. We're finishing our basement and this weekend was going to be the carpet, so I went to Lowe's and bought everything Thursday and banged it out alone on Friday.

She noticed the whole house being cleaned Friday night and was really relieved that we didn't have to take care of it this weekend. On Saturday we got up and that was when she realized I had taken care of the carpet and everything else. It was awesome, she was giddy with excitement because she pretty much had nothing to do all weekend. So I asked what she wanted to do and it was stereotypical Fall couple stuff; went and got pumpkins and mums for our porch, went and got some new Fall decorations and candles and then just hung around the house being lazy. While I worked out and walked the dog she did a bit of work to get ahead so she wouldn't be as busy this week. We ate dinner and since we were in a Fall mood we watched Hocus Pocus. 

On Sunday we slept in for the first time in ages... well first time for her, I sleep in all the time, don't judge me. We continued the fall theme and went apple picking. We came home and I made an apple pie. She started doing some work but after about a half hour she said screw it, went for a run and then came home and relaxed. We went to her mom's for a big Sunday dinner and when we got home I decided it was time to talk to her about her unsustainable stress situation. 

I told her I loved her and was in it for the long term but that I was worried about her and that her current situation wasn't healthy. She started crying, she thought I was sitting her down to break up with her! She knows that the way she's working isn't healthy but she didn't think it would go on this long. She kept thinking to herself ""just a few more days and I'll get into a flow...just another week..."" and before she knew it it's been 3 months and she's still pulling her hair out. I wasn't going to talk about the lack of sex but she brought it up and apologized. She said her problem isn't the lack of a sex drive/attraction but that she's just exhausted all the time. 

After we talked, I gave her a big hug, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex! woo! It's Columbus day today so we both are off and it happened again this morning, double woo!!

Some people had suggested I say we schedule some times to hang out which I was against, but my girlfriend suggested something very similar. Saturday night is now the night we make a point to have sex. It used to happen naturally a couple times a week, but with her new schedule that probably isn't going to happen. Saturday night is now our designated night to stay in and make dinner or go on a date with just the two of us and then go home and have sex haha.

So in conclusion, I'm going to take care of more of the housework so our weekends are less busy and we are going to make it a point to have sex at least once a week. We used to divide it pretty equally but I have a hell of a lot more free time during the week than she does. Also, communication communication, communication. I was thinking this was the beginning of the end, and after a few days and one honest conversation I think everything is going to be just fine. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Busted my ass last week to get all our housework/responsibilities taken care of before the weekend. Hung out and had a great weekend together. Discussed our situation Sunday night, we figured out a system that will work, and then we finally had sex! I'm going to shoulder more housework/random crap during the week so we can relax together on weekends.

Hi, r/relationships. I know this update is coming fast, but I've made my decision and I thought you'd all like to know. A lot has happened in the past day, but in the end, I think I'm making the right choice. Tbh I think I knew this is what I had to do all along, but I was in denial.

I want to start off by thanking everyone for their advice, kind words, and even tough love. I have decided to end our marriage and get a divorce ASAP. It's heartbreaking and painful for me to do this, but honestly, I don't think I could live with knowing my husband loves another woman *and* assaulted her in front of me. The fact that this is my SIL makes it even worse. I don't think we can come back from this and I would always feel like I wasn't his first choice.. plus, he touched and kissed Kate without her consent, which is an awful thing to do by itself.

I sat down and really, *really* thought about what happened and how it made me feel. It made me feel disgusted, hurt, and angry. It made me feel like an idiot. It broke my heart. I couldn't believe the man I loved, the man I have been with for almost a decade of my life, would betray me and hurt me like this. It almost doesn't feel real. To think we were going to have kids, to think I trusted him and gave him all the love I could. It fucking hurts.

A lot of you suggested that maybe he married me so he could be close to Kate. We sat down last night, I showed him your comments, and he broke down. He admitted to me that yes, he did marry me to be closer to her. It's always been her. From day one of our relationship, it's been a ploy to stay close to Kate. Not only is this devastating to me, but it's extremely creepy and I feel bad that Kate ever had to be around Jack. His intentions were almost predatory.. who knows what he would have done to Kate if her husband and I hadn't been there to intervene. I honestly think he would have done some truly horrible things to her, given the chance.

He begged me to stay. He promised he loved me, he could get over Kate, he wanted me. I was his soulmate. We were meant to be together. He would go to therapy to work on his issues and we would be okay. He was sobbing and begging and trying to convince me to stay. I wasn't hearing it. I'm done. He's a liar.. he's been lying to me for years. He's creepy, horrible, and I can't live with him knowing what he did and how he truly feels.

I called Charlie to talk to him about everything.. like always, he's here for me. He's incredibly pissed at Jack because of what Jack did to Kate. Kate is still shaken up and upset; she feels violated and her trust in Jack, someone she considered her friend for years, has been destroyed. Charlie told me that if I had chosen to stay with Jack, it was very likely our relationship would have died right then and there. Charlie told me he refused to talk to anybody who believed what Jack did to Kate (assaulted her) was okay or forgivable.. even if that somebody was me. He also thinks what Jack did to me for all these years is beyond cruel and he's angry about that, too. 

I still have to contact a lawyer and get things in order. It's only been a day since I've made my decision.. but you were all so, so helpful to me. I can't begin to express how thankful I am for your comments.

In the end, my brother and SIL are the people that matter most to me. They're my real family, the people who love me, and they're here to support me through this decision. I'm young, there's still hope for me to find someone who sincerely loves *me*, there's still hope of starting a family, there's still time left for all of that. I'd rather take my chances of finding someone new than staying with Jack.

Thank you, again, for everything. 

**EDIT/UPDATE #2**: Thanks for the condolences and kind words! It really means a lot to me. To address some concerns:

* I will be extra careful and keep an eye out for anything Jack tries to do. Like many of you said, his obsession is unraveling, so he might do something drastic. I'm going to contact my lawyer ASAP to start seeing what I can do, change all of my passwords, get my bank accounts in order, etc. I have also **removed any information of my future whereabouts and plans** as some of you suggested.

* I'm going to book an appointment with a therapist. I feel like it would benefit me and help me work through this whole thing.

* Kate doesn't want to talk to/interact with Jack, but she is thinking about getting a restraining order. Understandably, she doesn't feel safe around Jack at all and would rather have nothing to do with him. She's also going to be extra careful, since she's the person of Jack's obsession and he'll probably try contacting her/doing something crazy. Charlie is there to protect her (he's a former Marine, 6'3"" and pretty dang intimidating), so I'm sure they'll both be okay. We're all here for each other.

* Some people don't believe this is real because of my timeline (I said we've been together since HS in the last post, but then said ""almost a decade"" in this post). This was a mistake, I meant to type ""over a decade."" I can't prove the validity of my story, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I don't really feel the need to explain myself here. You either believe me or you don't. It's a bizarre situation. I can't explain Jack's behavior any better than you can.

* On the bright side, Charlie and Kate are still trying for a baby, so there's a pretty good chance I'll be an aunt in the near future. There's still hope for me to find ""The One."" In the meantime, I'm going to focus on me, and moving on from this whole thing.

Thanks for the concern and encouragement! :)

270,nora19294,Relationships,53foa6,2926,"My husband Eric and I have been married for 5 years. We have one child, a four-year-old little lady named Katherine. We both work busy jobs but I'm a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she's honestly become part of the family.


The other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, ""Want to hear me talk like Ella?"" And she started speaking Spanish! I'm not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn't really respond but I didn't think anything of it at the time. 


Then tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn't like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it's a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it's a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine. 


Ella has gone back to our house for the night, but I'm still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he's damaged our relationship with Ella, who's been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it's a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she'll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn't be married; that's a dealbreaker for me), but I can't see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work. 


A) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?


and B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?

I talked it over with my adoptive mother and my partner and I decided to see what my sister had to say. As a few people here suggested, I made a new email address and told her to only contact me there. I also told her I would only respond to her, that I wasn't ready to speak to my mother yet. I asked her why she was contacting me now, why she didn't stick up for me then, and what what she wanted from me. 

She told me that when everything was happening my father had forbidden any of my siblings from talking to anyone about it or attending the trial. Everyone knew I was in therapy for being gay, but he told them that my ""legal troubles"" were because I had run away from therapy and I was selling myself and doing drugs and I refused to come home. None of that is true. I did have a drug problem later, but that's not what the trial was about and I never sold myself or ran away. I had to go to the hospital because I got hurt and the doctors there called the police. I also desperately wanted to come home but they didn't want me back. 

Earlier this year my sister was playing a game with her son that she used to play with me when I was little and she realized there was nothing her son could do to make her stop loving him. She started asking my mother why they didn't find me and make me come home, get off drugs, etc. and my mother finally broke down and told her the truth. My sister immediately started looking for me but it took a while to track me down because I changed my name. 

She says she doesn't want anything from me and I believe her. She said she's sorry for what happened to me and that she would have stepped in if she knew. We've been emailing back and forth a million times a day and we've Skyped. She still seems pretty conservative but she told me that she ""watches and enjoys Ellen"" and that my husband and I look sweet together in the photos she saw online. She still lives near the rest of my family, but she might come out here to visit. She wants to meet my partner and she sent a very nice e-card to my new mother to thank her for taking care of me. I'm really happy to have her back in my life. 

I'm not sure what to think about my mother. My sister maintains that she really wants to see me and that she's so sorry and that my father made her do it, but she's still with him. And I'm even more hurt now that I know they lied about me. I put up with literal torture for them, and they threw me away and then told my family I was garbage so they would stop loving me too. She kept up the lie for ten years, and who knows how long she would have kept going if my sister hadn't been so persistent. 
 
Anyways, thanks for all the advice I got here, especially from those of you who tried to be understanding about my mixed feelings towards my family.

So to start this off say thank you immensely to those who shared personal experience and advice. 

Lacy came home yesterday while I was home and immediately broke down crying when she walked through the door. She immediately apologized for leaving and for making me worry.

Turns out I really underestimated Lacy's redditing and she ended up seeing the post when she was gone. Honestly I can't think of a better way for this to have gone. She told me she stayed up all night reading every single comment.

In summary, she did some serious self-reflection and has admitted to me that she is suffering from depression and that the injuries were a way for her to receive the attention that she wanted so incredibly badly. But also admitted that the whole process really just made her feel pathetic and worthless inside and ultimately worsened her depression. It had become a rather vicious cycle. 

We talked a long time but it was ultimately her who said she needed and wanted therapy. We have spent time today looking through her options and she plans to make an appointment Monday. 

I think it was the stories from those who had similar experiences really hit it home for her.

Hello everyone. First of all, big apologies for how long overdue this update is. Since the rules limit me for one update only I wanted to have the most full outcome to give you. Thank you all so, so much for your help and support and advice, I didn't expect so many people to respond to me and I really am grateful.

Sadly the outcome isn't so happy. My conclusion from the original post was to go to highest management first and then police if the result wasn't satisfactory, which is what I did. 

I went straight to the store manager the morning after my post and was advised to write up and sign a formal grievance, which I did. I then met with two other managers to discuss the details of what happened and any other relevant stuff. They told me they'd talk to the manager in question and any witnesses and get back to me in a week after investigations had taken place. In the meantime, my manager was not allowed to work with me and was told to reschedule all his shifts or work elsewhere. 

A week passed and I heard nothing. When I went to find out, apparently due to staff holidays it couldn't be completed in time. I asked how much longer and was told a week. I felt this was too long and was really restless by this point already and so my boyfriend came with me to speak to the police. 

We explained the situation and my details were taken down and then we met with a sergeant. To summarise, she told us that in the UK there is no specific law against accessing someone's private phone/recording off someone's private phone without permission. As such, they are unable to search his phone as no arrests can be made. The only thing they could do was go to his house and explain it had been reported and that if he ever distributed it he would be arrested, which they did, and he LIED TO THE POLICE and said he hadn't done anything. Sadly, they said there was nothing more they could do.

The internal investigation then concluded and I was told my manager had denied everything, made up a false excuse for the apology text he sent me and basically called me a liar. They told me that there is no CCTV where it happened and nobody who was in the area at the time saw anything (no shit, they were the complete opposite end of the room, as I had already explained). They tried to say they weren't taking sides, but to be honest it seemed like they were. They're moving ME from the department instead of him, because moving him is ""harder"". I really enjoyed my job and now basically I have to suffer because my manager is a disgusting liar. They don't seem to care how serious this is. I ended up almost crying when they legitimately said ""maybe you didn't see anything at all"". I feel like they're accusing me of lying and imagining it, even though one of the managers involved was the one that caught me in the corridor bawling my eyes out.

I really wish I could've given a happy update. I'm so upset that I have to move and give up something I enjoy when he gets off without even a slap on the wrist, goes on knowing he can probably do this again to someone else and carry on being the scumbag he is, not to mention, he might still have the videos. He may have distributed them already but how the hell would I know. I have no idea what to do now. The police say nothing else can be done. If anyone has any legal advice around this issue within the UK law then I would be very very grateful for that. 

Sorry for the length, and if it's worded badly. Again, thank you all for your advice. I'm sorry this was a bad update.

tl;dr: Went to higher management and police about how I caught my manager recording a private video from my phone to his phone. He lied to both; management say not enough evidence to do anything, he gets to keep his job but I have to lose mine. Police say nothing can be done due to no UK law surrounding the subject.

We've known each other for a few years now, we met at the university and now we're both in grad school. I was her first real friend in her life as she puts it, as others have never been interested in friendship with her. As months and years went by we became closer, we did a lot of things together, we studied together and we were great friends. Her family are rather protective of her but they trust me completely with her.

I never looked at her sexually, she was more like a cousin to me. I never considered dating her either. I really love spending time with her and being her best friend, the one that she trusts and can always rely on.

Yesterday we submitted a major piece of coursework and we're finally free. I asked if she likes to celebrate. I picked her up and brought her to my place, we ordered pizza and had a few beers and enjoyed ourselves. The plan usually is that she takes my couch these nights as she often stays here (a lot of the times it's studying together though).

Last night she was really intimate and kept holding my hand. One thing led to another, we were having sex on my bed. The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life. After sex she laid on top of me and told me that this was her first time having sex and she's glad that it was with the right person. We slept in each other's arms. This morning I drove her home and when we arrived she kissed me and told me that she's glad that last night finally happened.

I'm a little overwhelmed. On one hand I certainly love her and last night felt very right when it was happening, on the other hand I can't shake off this feeling of guilt that I'm having right now. I feel like she's been more or less isolated in her life because of her physical condition and I'm the first person who's really been her friend and she's opening up to me like that, not maybe because I'm the right one for her or that I deserve her but because I'm the only option. I feel like I'm taking advantage of her.

275,lackofdog,Relationships,53q92i,2904,"Hi reddit. My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals. 

To give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted. 

When I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit. 

When Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day.

Throughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog. 

About 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house. 

On top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog. 

Since we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be ""no"" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog. 

I'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot. 

Is there a way to compromise on this? 

TL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has. She gave me an ultimatum - either her or a dog.

First off, I want to say thanks to the advice everyone had given.  There were a few thoughts that resonated that I appreciate.  Secondly, get your popcorn.  *Disgunbgood.jpg.gif*  I know we all like a good story, and this is somewhat therapeutic for me.  This all happened a few days ago and it took me a bit to digest everything. 

Quite a bit of advice was around direct confrontation and asking her what the heck was going on.  After numerous ignored phone calls and text messages she finally decided to pick up her phone.  She apologized and said her phone died and she didn't realize it until it was too late.  I started in right away with that she had previously sent me a message non nonchalantly that she just 'wasn't feeling it' between us.  After that message, we talked and she said she was just feeling stressed and was taking it out on me.  Understandable...stress happens.  So my next question was this: ""Your friend had told me that you were seeing someone else.  Whats going on?  Do you want to break up??"" 

Her answer?  ""What??? WHO SAID THAT??? oh my god.... who said that?? Oh my gosh, Im sooooo tired of all these rumors about me!   Who said that?!""    She went on like this for quite a while.  What struck me was that she was more concerned about someone ratting her out than the accusations.   She assured me over and over that no she did not want to break up and then started making me feel awful that I would make these statements towards her.  Didn't I know how she felt about me?  That i was saying this made her feel like I didn't trust her.  I suddenly felt like the worst person in the world. She also pleaded with me to give up who it was that said this, but I wasn't budging on that.  In the end, she said she was having an emotional, stressful day and just wanted to relax and we would talk later, maybe over the weekend.  After taken in the advice from here... I felt like she was misdirecting. 

I sat there in a mix of feeling like something was amiss, and feeling awful that i just accused my beautiful girlfriend of cheating on me.  I felt terrible.  I sat for a bit, feeling like I just put this huge crack in our relationship.  I love her to pieces.  I needed to go apologize.  

I hopped in my car and drove the hour to her city and decided to get her a quart of her favorite chocolate ice cream on my way there.  When I stopped into the shop to pick up this treat, I run right smack into her daughter hanging out with her boyfriend.  They are both in college, doing night classes and just got out of school and wanted a treat.   We were chit chatting and she was going to be staying at her bf for the night, but forgot one of her workbooks and needed to stop at the house real quick to pick it up.

After chatting, the daughters bf took off and we both drove up to my GF house.  I pulled into the street because they have assigned parking at her unit.  Her daughter actually pulled up behind me instead of her own spot and when we got out I said, ""whats up, neighbor took your spot again?"" as we walked up to the door. 

""No.... thats not my neighbors car..."" 

I don't know if it was the way she said it or her sigh afterwards or what but suddenly it felt like my heart just sank.  I KNEW what we were going to find, but I was hoping for anything but that. 

Her daughter and I both shuffled through the door and stopped immediately in the entryway.  We could just hear them.  There's no mistaking it.  You know the sound:  rhythmic thumping and moaning with little exclamations of pleasure.  The bedroom was right across from us.  

Her daughter looked at me with her eyes as big as saucers and just goes 'oh my god....im sooooooo sorry'.   At this moment it felt like i was living outside my body. Its hard to explain but suddenly it was like i was just a person watching actions happen. I couldn't really feel anything and  I didn't know what to do.  Here i am...standing here...with a quart of ice cream while my GF is getting railed in her bedroom.  I had no idea how to proceed. My whole body just felt like i couldn't control it. 

Her daughter suddenly just screams 'MOM! WHAT THE FUCK!' that sounded like a cross between a banshee wail and an firetruck siren.  

My GF actually ran out of the bedroom, naked and all, possibly thinking there was some emergency.  Maybe motherly instincts that something bad just happened.  I don't know.  She started to formulate words but fell silent as soon as she saw the too of us standing there. 

Eventually a stream of words fell out of her mouth: ""oh my god. What are you doing here?  You're not supposed to be here.  what are you doing here?""  She kept repeating it over and over until she ran back into the bedroom.  

I still stood there. shocked.  Still having an out of body experience. I don't know how much time passed. seconds or hours.  It blurs.   She came out clothed in her pajamas and was talking to whoever it was on the other side of the bedroom door.  My GF (EX now) started yelling at her daughter and I about why we were in the house.  I think the realization of everything was suddenly starting to hit her because she started crying and making unintelligible noises.  Her daughter starts to scream at her about 'how could you do this??' and 'you did it AGAIN?'   

At this point...I had seen enough.  I couldn't even look at her anymore. Everything was numb and my ears felt like they were ringing. My body still wasn't my own.   I walked over to her kitchen table and put down the ice cream saying, 'I know you get hungry after sex....so heres some ice cream.'  and walked out the door.   She started sobbing 'Nooo' but it I just kept walking and drove home.   That was a few days ago. 

I didn't go to work the next day.  

My phone has been BLOWN up. I have not replied.   For your reading pleasure here are some of my favorite messages:

""If we had spent more time together it wouldn't have happened.""

""It doesn't mean anything.  You know that I love you""

""If you cared anything about us or our relationship you would talk to me.""

""Are you ignoring me?""

""Please"" I have lots of 'please's.  

""if you cared, we would be able to work this out"" 

It goes on and on.  

Right now I still feel kinda numb.  I just don't understand how or why this happened.  I gave this girl and her family so much and my all and it didn't even matter.  I provided for them when times were tough and did so much to make our lives good.  I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel like I don't mean anything or that I can't make someone happy now. It's frustrating.  I know Ill get over it in time but it definitely hurts. I don't understand why or how this could happen. We were soooo good too.  So many questions I want to ask her, but Im forcing myself to NOT have contact with her and just going to move on. 

In retrospect I wish I kept the ice cream.

277,CrayThomas,Non-Romantic,56xjru,2881,"About 8 years ago I decided that I don't want to live around people anymore. This isn't about something that happened or me thinking people are bad or other crazy thoughts, I just could never fit with people. I never had friends, but never felt like I needed them either. I think I might be somewhere in the autism spectrum but I don't have an official diagnosis. I'm cool and fine on my own.

I grew up in NYC and finally decided that the environment there is no good for me. I decided to move to a different state, buy some cheap land in a very small village and built a house for myself. The only people I interact with in person on a daily basis are the people at the market where I buy stuff and when something is delivered to me. To be honest, it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm much happier and more comfortable.

I have a lot of online friends. I'm a software engineer and make apps and games. I can work from the comfort of my own home and the living costs are so low that I have no stress about money. I've already made enough to last me 30 more years of living like this.

Now my family are the only people that I have some sort of emotional connection with. I have a more or less good relationship with all of them especially my younger sister who visits me quite often. The thing is, they all say they miss me. They want me to come back living in NYC, they say I should get out of my solitary life and start a family for myself. I can't do those things. And my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying.

I feel really bad when they're upset at me, it feels like everyone I know is upset so I must have done something wrong. I'm not good at communicating these feelings. I think they thinks I'm sad because I'm lonely but I'm not. It's by choice. 

First, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?

My post didn't get a lot of attention, but I wanted to update the people who commented and sent me PMs.

I applied for the job. I landed an interview. I got the job.

I told my mom the day I got the call for the interview that I applied for it, and now I had an interview in a few days. She wasn't too pleased that I didn't tell her I applied for the job anyway, but she quickly got over it when I informed her again that I would love to get the job and if I did get it, I saw myself staying with the organization for probably the rest of my life.

She became excited for me, and the day before I left to go to the interview, she expressed how much she was proud of me for following my dreams, like she did not, and not letting anyone stop me, like she did. She wished me good luck and told me that she knew I'd do great.

I start the new job in a few weeks, which will give me plenty of time to get my things together and prepare for a huge move in my life. My boss is extremely excited for me (tbh, I think she helped get me the job. I listed her as a reference, and she knows most of the people I'll be working with), and can't wait to see me succeed in this new position (conservation is a small world).

Thank you to those who told me to go for the job anyway, because without that push from strangers, I don't think I would have applied.

So, I told you about ""Fiona"", the cutie pie who goes to my church who I asked out on a date.  Almost all of you reassured me it was a date, which was good advice, because it totally was.

We had brunch together and then went for a walk near the waterfront of our city. We had great chemistry, talking up a storm, but we hadn't entirely gotten ""date-y"" yet, I really wanted to hold her hand but I was too nervous. Then the fairly nice weather turned into a torrential downpour, and she invited me back to her place. We got stuck in the rain, but luckily, she didn't live too far.

When we got back to her place, we were talking and I said ""By the way...I think you're really cute."" She said ""I think you are too...I'm just kind of anxious. I'm an anxious person."" We kind of looked at each other for a second and I said, ""So...do you wanna kiss?"" (I prefer to just ask these things.) 

She said yes, and that kiss turned into a full-on makeout session which turned into some really amazing sex. At one point I said to her, before we actually started having sex, ""I really want to do this but I'm always worried that if I sleep with someone on the first date, they'll get the impression that I'm only in it for the sex, which isn't the case."" She basically told me not to worry, because she wasn't getting that impression. And then we had some seriously awesome sex.

We're hanging out again Wednesday evening. I have this terrible tendency to get ten steps ahead of myself with these things, but we seem to have really amazing chemistry and I've really got a good feeling about this.

280,exgirlonthephone,Infidelity,4zo0cs,2871,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. 

He's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. 

This is actually how we met. 

I modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. 

That was, until, Rachel came into the picture. 

I've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. 

That said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. 

The lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. 

They also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. 

I'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. 

Rachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. 

The real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. 

Rachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. 

I really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. 

He has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just ""kindred"" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. 

Am I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? 

TL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? 

**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.

**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. 

**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. 

In any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. 


**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** 
 [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)

First of all, I?d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. 

Second, I?d like to address a few things: 

1. My boyfriend ? sorry, ex boyfriend ? has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That?s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. 

2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I?ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that ? but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they?ll find other ways to cheat.

3. I?m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just ? yeah.

Okay, now for the good stuff! ? or I guess, the bad stuff. 

I met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you?ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, ?What?s going on between you and Rachel?? His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, ?DO NOT bullshit me.? 

I tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer ? ? 

Yeah, I?m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I?m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.

He could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I?d had a switchblade on me, I can?t say for certain I wouldn?t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.

Kidding. Totally kidding.  

We met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or ? I don?t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!

I asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. 

The moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn?t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. 

**BARF.**

They kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. 

They had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.

And they?ve been fucking ever since. 

He mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don?t care. I?m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don?t know why or how. I didn?t ask and I don?t care to know.

Funnily enough, Ian said he doesn?t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he?s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. 

I literally said that.  

In any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. 

My friends and family, and most of Ian?s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she?s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she?s always there for me. 

For real, you guys, I?m going to miss his family. They?re good people. The best people. 

This is my first ?adult? breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you?re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you?ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it?s ? well, it?s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.

So, that?s the conclusion to this story. That?s what happened. 

Thank you again to everyone. 

If I have anything to add, I?ll do so below.

TL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.

**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* 

**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys.

Those past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her.

I'm getting a lot of update requests, and Danny just headed home so I figured I'd go ahead and post. I have exciting stuff to tell you guys! First I wanted to say thanks to everybody who commented, you all really helped me calm down and stop overthinking everything. I appreciate it a lot.

When Danny showed up we were both really nervous and awkward at first. I was really scared to say anything, but I broke the tension by telling him how much I had enjoyed the night before. He broke out into a huge grin and turned bright red, lit up like a christmas tree. He told me he was so relieved, and that he had been obsessing over it all night worried for the same reasons I had been. 

I told him that it was my first sexual experience ever and that I was questioning my sexuality now. He told me that he had been questioning his sexuality for a while, and that he had feelings for men before, but had mostly seen me as just a friend until last night, when he realized that I was kind of sort of coming onto him in a really roundabout way. It's funny, I didn't really think of myself as coming onto him but I definitely made that statement hoping something would come of it...

Anyway I told him that first and foremost I valued our friendship and wanted to stay friends whatever happened between us. He agreed strongly. He asked me if I was okay with working out our feelings together (read: having sex until we figure out how we feel) and I told him yes. After all this heavy conversation we decided to play some CS:GO together like we usually do but we ended up in bed together instead. Afterwards we talked some more and discussed the possibility of a relationship. He said he feels like we know each other well enough that he wouldn't feel like we were rushing in, and I agreed with him. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and I said yes! I'm so happy about it, too! I've never felt so attracted to anyone before.

We haven't told anyone yet, but decided not to go out of our way to keep it a secret. The area we live in is reasonably tolerant and neither of our parents are anti-gay, which I am grateful for. I am worried about telling my sister, who has recently become a born-again christian and had a lot of horrible things to say
about the supreme court ruling on FB. I'm also a little concerned about telling our other two friends, but I think after the initial shock wears off, they'll come around.

Now, I'm not super duper concerned with slapping a label on my sexuality and calling it a day (thanks to you guys, I appreciate all the advice in that regard!) but the more I think about it, the more I think that I really am gay, or at least gay-leaning bisexual. It kind of feels like the best time to be realizing it with the gay marriage ruling happening. Every time I think about it I feel giddy.

First of all, thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my original post! The general consensus was that I had handled the situation well, or at least as best as I could have, given my situation and experience. Even those of you who thought I'd screwed up said so in a way that was sensitive and respectful. So thank yous all around!

Now, on to the update!

I mentioned in my original post that I had only sent one of these notifications to our CEO once before, and no one had said anything then. **When he replied to me that time, it was only one word: *""Thanks.""* No salutation, no signature. Just that one word.** Understandable, he's a busy man. But this is very important for understanding what happened this time.

I got into work this morning and opening my email. Among my various other usual emails, I saw that the CEO had responded to my original notification email at about 7:30 pm last night (a Saturday!) He had kept intact the original list of people to be notified, so everyone who had seen my original message also saw his reply to me, including Janice. This time, it was three words, but I could feel the deliberateness of every one.

So yeah, I think it's pretty clear where he stands on this whole business. I feel a million times better, since the CEO is clearly a *very* classy guy. My boss also saw his response and also told me that I'd done everything right, and not to worry about it.

My first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I figured I'd update anyway, as it's a happy one.

The TL;DR of my last post was that, after recently moving cities and experiencing a lifestyle change (boyfriend started working 80-100 hours/week) I was feeling stressed out and drained from my job, which involves animal research, and thought that getting a pet would really help me (as it has in the past). Since we really don't have time for a dog, I wanted to get a cat, and while he initially agreed to it, my boyfriend sat me down 8 months ago and reiterated that he wasn't super into cats and that since I seemed to be adapting well if I would hold off on getting one. Since then, my mental health has gone down a little and I wanted advice on how to talk to him about it.

Firstly, I got a couple of PMs and comments telling me that my boyfriend doesn't have to work that much and that I shouldn't be okay with it. This is a little naive, people. Everyone that has his position works as much as he does and he loves his job, so he needs to put up with the hours for about 5 years until he's moved up the chain of command. So that's not really up for discussion and never has been. He loves his job and feels fulfilled at work, which is something I want for him.


ONTO THE UPDATE...


I got a lot (a looot) of comments that sort of told me off for wanting to make a plea for a pet that my boyfriend wasn't on board with so I initially decided not to broach the topic and keep it to myself. 

However, I guess I was closer to my breaking point than I realized because the next night when he got in at midnight, after having a long and stressful day that had put me in a bad headspace for the evening (even after going for a 5k run and lifting some weights) I just sort of had a breakdown in his arms. He was flabbergasted and worried and asked me what was wrong.

I sort of... snotted, hiccoughed, and cried as I told him that I felt really lonely and was upset that he'd asked me to hold off on the cat, that I was very sad that I interacted only with animals that hate me and that I can't get attached to all day, and that my colleagues find that their pets ground them; that I couldn't continue coming home to an empty house and that pets were really important to me.

He was very shocked to hear all of this, stroked my hair for a while, made me tea, ran me a bath, and said we'd have a serious talk when I got back from my conference (monday & tuesday). I was a little put off by the fact that he wasn't talking about it right away (but understanding because by the time we got to bed it was probably 2am).

I was at my conference until last night, but when I got in at around 8PM, I was surprised that our condo door was open--my boyfriend was home (never happens)! I was even more surprised when he came to the door, grinning, with a big Maine Coon cat in his arms that I'm very familiar with--my childhood kitty that lives with my parents. 

Well, I was pretty much a mess after that, happy and sobbing all over Snuffles (Snuffles rather frantically twisting his body in 1000 bizarre ways trying to get away and thereby avoid salty tears and snot), and my boyfriend explained: we were ""borrowing"" Snuffles for the next 7 weeks from my parents. He then said with an even bigger grin that he was serving as my cat ""in the interim of waiting for your new Abyssinian kitten to age to 10 weeks, at which point we'll give Snuffles back and bring in the kitten.""

My heart was so full. I was surprised that he remembered my brief mention that I thought that an Abyssinian would be a good breed fit for us (not super vocal, very friendly, short hair, indoor cat). I definitely never expected him to pay for the cat or anything, but he has put a deposit down and I will go pick a kitten from the breeder's litter in the next couple of weeks!!

I asked him what had made him change his mind the full 180 degrees and he just sort of explained that he was only ever ""sort of"" against the cat and thought I had been doing just fine mentally, so I didn't need one, and just figured we'd get a dog once we'd moved out of the city centre in 5 years or so, once both of us have reduced our hours.

He also is still a little bit concerned that a cat isn't going to be a fix-all, so I made an appointment with a psychologist I used to see and will be driving to my hometown next week for a ""check in"" with her. 

I thought he didn't want a cat because his dad thinks they're an ""unmanly"" pet, so I asked him as much, and he rolled his eyes and said ""Look, the CEO of Snapchat can't even find a hotter partner than I can and he definitely isn't dating someone that is getting a PhD. There's literally nothing in the world that is a threat to my manliness"" 

Also, just like I thought (because I know my boyfriend well, not just a ""magical rationalization"" I ""made up just because [I] want a cat""), this morning I woke up to my boyfriend spooning Snuffles instead of me; he'll be fine having a cat.

I have not been able to respond to everyone, but please be assured that I have read every one of your comments, and I appreciate them all. Everyone is doing well on our end, and while the pain is still immense, sharing memories ad photos with his friends has helped a lot.

I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my first thread. Your words were so kind and helped me out with a difficult situation. I'd also like to offer an apology, as I feel I misstated some things in my original post. My difficulty was not from finding out what kind of person my son was just before his death. Additionally, I got lots of posts giving advice to the likes of ""I would let them speak,"" which baffled me slightly, as I hadn't thought that that's what I was asking. I had never considered keeping them out of the funeral and letting them speak their words, however when I re-read my original post, I can see how I didn't make it clear that I was already working with them on delivering their speeches. For this lack of clarity, I sincerely apologize. However, I read all of the comments in full, and I greatly appreciate everyone's input.

To update, the funeral took place yesterday was was, perhaps fittingly, a weirdly wonderful affair. My wife his, younger sister and I spoke, as did 4 of his friends. We decided to hold the funeral in his adopted city rather than here for 2 reasons: First was because we all know he loved that city so much, and Second was to make it easier for his friends to attend. (I should state, pretty much everyone in our hometown was in a position to travel, but his friends aren't, as they are students and it's midterm season for them.) Although people had reached out to me, I was stunned by turnout. I didn't get a proper headcount, but the room that I though was relatively large was down to standing room only.


The family's speeches and 3 of his friends were relatively normal for a funeral, and recounted fond memories of his life and personality. The 4th friend to speak was not.

Quite simply, he wanted to roast my son, namely in the style of a comedy central roast. When he pitched the idea to me, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give him his moment. Part of it was one of the few aspects of my son that remained constant throughout his life: he hated tradition for tradition's sake. He was always someone who would question (sometimes at unfortunately inappropriate times) why everything is the way it is. Think along the lines of ""Why is the bride supposed to wear white?"" while acutaly at a wedding. A second part of my decision to allow it was because a common theme I found out through his friends was that he was quite a joker himself towards the end, and would do anything for a laugh, going as far as making himself the butt of the joke just to get a positive reaction from them. Finally, I agreed because he was completely upfront with me about what he wanted to say (he handed me his script) and said that if I was uncomfortable with it or the idea, that he would still be honoured if he could give a more traditional speech. 

This led me to the one difficult in the funeral, namely, where do I put this joker? Do I do it at the beginning to set a tone, or at the end to leave on a high? I discussed with my wife and his friend, and we agreed on a compromise, where he would give a short talk at the beginning to set the mood that wouldn't be all sad, and then he delivered his main set at the end, so we could all leave without tears in our eyes.

So, as weird as it might sound, I think we all had fun at the funeral, and I was incredibly touched to have met so many of his friends. While I still sort of feel that I' mourning 2 people, I was so proud that my son broke out of his shell when he left. I know his friends are wonderful people, and I can only imagine how happy my son was up to the end.

**TL;DR:** 2 special needs kids. SAHM to basically be able to do all the therapies and appointments. Am huge now. Husband never has sex with me but swears he loves me and is attracted to me. Works late and very little interaction. Feel like he's with me not to be the asshole who leaves his wife with 2 special needs kids. Didn't celebrate my birthday and mother's day was not much better.  He may be on the spectrum a well. **\*\*How can i fix this mess esp the dead bedroom/lack of love?\*\***

We've been married 11 years. High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him.

Jack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4.

Jack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job.

My life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child,

We were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid.

When we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my ""ethnic looks"". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself.

My birthday he ""forgot"" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him.

I feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything.

He swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids.

I love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break.

He works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken.

I was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy.

289,DisastrousProfession,Relationships,ahtgdj,2834,"I just want to say up front that I'm a dumbass and I know it, and this whole situation is my fault, but I do need help. My wife and I were high school sweethearts and got married very young. We went to the same college and got married when we were both 19 year old sophomores. I love her and we definitely made the right decision, and I would do it all over again exactly the same way with no hesitation except for one thing-the ring that I picked.

Now when I was a teen I was definitely a douche. I'm talking affliction tees, hair gel, recreational MMA, macho bs. We picked out our rings together, and of course I wanted my ring to look cool. My wife, who is brilliant and always has been, chose a classy and timeless style for hers, and I did not.

Friends, my ring is large, clunky, mostly black, and has a cringy design on it in silver along with a band of lab created fire opal inlay. I thought it was so badass at the time, and could not understand what my dad was laughing about when he first saw it. Well I sure get it now. 

I've matured a TON in the last ten years and have slowly come to hate it. I am very self conscious of it at my professional office job, and sometimes even take it off if I have important meetings with clients. I feel horribly guilty every time. 

I've gently broached the topic of maybe getting a ring that looks more professional, but my wife has pushed back, saying that we picked our rings together and have had them for ten years and that's really special to her. I absolutely do not want to hurt her feelings. How can I approach this in a way that would make it easier for her to accept, short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)?

I need some advice because I know I'm very biased and what I want is what's best for my daughter but I think my feelings are getting in the way of that. 

I had been with ""Tom""  for about 8 months at that point. He was on the baseball team and very popular. 

But one day I discovered I was pregnant and told Tom. He freaked out and got super pissed. He demanded I get an abortion, said he would not stay with me otherwise. He did offer to pay the full expenses of it though.

So I went to the clinic and...I couldn't do it. I'm very pro choice and told myself the logical thing to do would be to have an abortion. But when it came down to it...I just couldn't do it. I admit part of it was that I was afraid but I also felt an attachment for my baby. The thought of getting rid of him/her made me feel like throwing up.

So I told Tom that I did love him and I wasn't trying to trap him but I simply couldn't have an abortion. Maybe we could look into adoption but abortion was out. 

Tom said he had never loved me and while I was fun I was now causing him too much trouble for him to bother with me anymore and I was right, I wasn't going to trap him. He said I was free to choose to keep the baby and he was free to choose to have nothing to do with me or ""it"" and to not even think of trying to get child support from him.

I won't go into details but Tom made it clear he would make life as miserable as possible for me if I tried to contact him again, get child support, etc.

Maybe it was wrong to do but I figured all that trouble and drama just wasn't worth it and I would make my own way. I was, however, devastated and completely heartbroken. I admit it really fucked me up.

I never spoke with or saw Tom again. I did consider adoption but in the end, long story short, I chose to keep my child. ""Faith"" is 4 now. It's been a long and hard road but I graduated college and got a job. We live in a tiny apartment and finances are tight but we make do.

I love Faith like crazy and I do not regret the choice to keep her whatsoever. She makes me a better person and we have a good life.

However three days ago I received a letter in the mail. It was from Tom. Inside the envelope was a letter and a check for $3000. This is what the letter said

""*(My name), I know this is coming out of nowhere and I'm sorry but I didn't know a better way to do this.*

*I am so sorry for how I acted 5 years ago. I was selfish and a complete jerk. I know that doesn't begin to cover it. These past five years have really had an effect on me. I got a job at (blank). I started hanging out with different people. Good people instead of college jocks. I know I ran from my responsibility and I treated you  with callous cruelty.*

*I know I can't undo what I did but I want to make it right. Here is a check for $3000 for Faith. I know that doesn't begin to cover what her expenditures have been but I wanted to show I am serious about what I'm about to say.*

*I want to be a part of our daughter's life. I will go as slow as you like. I would very much like to set up regular child support payments as well as pay off whatever back child support I owe you for the past five years, including hospital appointments during your pregnancy. I know I don't deserve it, but I want to meet my daughter and be a part of her life in whatever way I can. I want to help her and I want to help you and start making up for the terrible way I acted.*

*Here is my contact information. I am willing to do what you ask of me. Thank you for your time. Tom.*

I was/am blown away. I'm also beyond pissed off. I'm thinking of the pregnancy I had to deal with after getting dumped like that. Exams and papers I had to write. Giving birth to her on my own. The late night feedings, all the diaper changes, the constant crying, trying to afford clothes to keep Faith warm during the winter as she grew while also making sure she didn't go hungry, the tantrums, the first steps, first words, the potty training.

He wasn't there for ANY of that and now he just wants to come waltzing into her life like nothing happened after doing whatever he felt like now that Faith is out of the unfun baby years and she's a well behaved child who can now carry on a conversation and knows how to use toilet and doesn't wake up every two hours.

Faith has started asking questions like where is her daddy, how come she doesn't have a daddy and I've been doing my best. I've been saying Mommy doesn't know where Daddy is (true until now) and she doesn't have a father because Daddy wasn't ready to be one when she was born. Maybe that's the wrong answer but I am doing my absolute best.

I'm thinking of how Tom hurt me and bailed when life got hard. I can't stand the thought of him doing that to Faith. She's a sweetheart and quite sensitive. She doesn't understand unkindness, she makes friends with everyone and is very innocent. I've done my best to teach her to be a calm, kind, respectful person and everyone loves her.

However I do know she needs a good male role model in her life and I do feel guilty for not having one for her. I haven't had a boyfriend or dated since Tom because all my energy and focus has been on graduating college, getting a job, and being a good mother to my daughter.

I never really thought about Tom much after Faith was born but now that I am with this...intrusion into our lives I think I hate and despise him. I want him to just go away.

I wanted to not even cash the check and to tell him to take his money and shove it but my parents and close friends reminded me that that is Faith's money and she is entitled to it and I agree.

At minimum I want to get some child support going because Faith deserves all the financial assistance and opportunities she can get.

However I know if I get regular child support Tom will want to be in Faith's life and frankly, I don't want that. I don't want him to hurt her and bail when life gets hard, because it IS when you have a kid. I also feel like he doesn't deserve her. 4 year olds are a lot more fun than infants. How convenient he suddenly shows up and wants to be a ""dad"" when the hardest part is out of the way.

But. I honestly do want what's best for Faith. I think she deserves to have a GOOD daddy. I just don't think Tom is. I think Faith is better off having no dad than a bad or half assed one.

She deserves the money. But am I right to take the money and not give Tom any access to my daughter?I can't stand the thought of him hurting her. The thought of dropping her off at his house where I don't have access to her makes me want to scream and run away.

Please help me think clearly. Am I out of line for taking Tom's money but saying that's as close as he will ever get to her? I am not convinced in the slightest he has changed. I feel like this is guilt money and I want to throw that check in the trash. But it's Faith's money, not mine.

Faith and I have a good life and I feel like Tom is going to ruin that. But is it right to keep Faith from her biological parent when he has sent the money? I hate feeling like I owe her him because of that.

Please give me some advice and tough love if need be. I'm willing to listen if it's in the best interest of my daughter.

291,throwawaywifehatesme,[new],az648p,2835,"This all went down about an hour ago and my wife is still crying in our bathroom with the door locked. 

Backstory: We had our son (now 11 months old) while my wife is in residency. She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help.

For anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year.

The first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says ""Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!"" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working. 

So we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it.

Today it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'. My wife has today off and has been home all morning. My mom and I have been trying to get him to say bye all day without giving it away that we already know he can say bye. Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes ""oh you never sent me this one!"" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye.

My wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before. I couldn't say or do anything to comfort her. Now she's locked herself in the bathroom crying and won't come out. I'm on our bed hoping someone can please tell me what to do to make this better.

&#x200B;

I  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called ?old timers?  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn?t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague ?Tina? still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it.

Tina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She?s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues ? she struggles in some areas and  while she?d definitely make a great director as she?s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we?re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00.

Most  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot (I think he may actually be in his late twenties). He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went.

When  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn?t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he?ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues.

After  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he?d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer.

Tina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM.

&#x200B;

I  really don't know what to do or say. If she asks, should I be honest  about this guy's presentation? Should I avoid her the rest of the day? I  want to support her, but have no idea how to even begin talking to her.

tl;dr Friend applied for a job she has worked towards for two years. She got proverbially destroyed in the interview but has no idea another candidate is going to get it.

If I didn't do that right I apologize, long time lurker of reddit and not much experience posting 

For all wondering it went fluidly: I got up, showered, packed my lunch, and left for work. The hardest part for me was saying goodbye in the morning. It's my routine that I wake him up, he gives me a kiss, tells me he loves me and tells me to be safe. It was all ""normal"" to him and he did just that. Tears were threatening to spill over the entire time he was saying goodbye to me, and believe if it had not been dark, he would have known something was up. (I wanted to yell and scream, at him, but I didn't) 

I left, treated myself to breakfast in an empty park and waited. The nanny cams that I bought have a live feed option thru your smartphone. I ate my breakfast while watching him clean up the house, watched my dogs torture each other (I left the dishes from dinner last night in the sink on purpose, petty I know but I needed to get some kicks in).  

Then she came over, there wasn't much fanfare, he placed the dogs in the backyard, she came into the living room and then things started happening. I let it happen, I let both of them get comfortable, move into the guest room waiting for things to heat up a little more. I had switched all the exhaust fans on throughout the house before I left( they cover up some noise and the door can be noisy). I parked right in front of my house and managed to open the door without being too loud. 

I had decided that just walking in like I normally do and putting my stuff down in my normal chair was the way to go. I closed the door put my stuff down (all while watching them on the camera) and called out as I'm walking down the hall ""Hey babe?! Guess what, I got cancelled! Where are you?"" 

Screaming ensued from her(I redditor called it!). Lots of ""Oh my god, you said she wasn't going to be here, what the fuck is wrong with you."" while scrambling to find something to cover herself. I managed to act surprised and said something along the line of "" Does someone want to explain what the fuck is going on?"" 

I managed to not get on my soapbox and preach at the fat slag, I found her fat ass running out of my house covered with a towel and yoga pants around her knees to be much more humorous. 

He was dumbfounded, he could not say anything for at least 10 minutes. I maintained silence as well, I just stood there and stared at him with the ""uh hello.... you need to explain the naked chick that just ran out of my house"" look. 

I couldn't stand the silence anymore, I had to break it. I said ""I did nothing to deserve this kind of treatment, this is not the way you treat someone you love."" I then walked into my bathroom and proceeded to let myself cry silently for about 10 minutes. During that time he came to his senses and was trying to weed himself out trouble using every excuse in the book. Telling me he thinks he is a sex addict and wants help....blah blah blah. 

After my tears were dry I opened the bathroom door and just said, ""Please get your things that you can now, get a friend to help you with your large things tomorrow while I am here, I am changing the locks tonight and you are no longer welcome here""  

I proceeded to make myself a bump on a chair watching netflix and cuddling my dogs and totally ignoring the hurt puppy dog eyes and crying fits he was having. 

He took all his clothes and he left, he had a friend pick him up. I had a(married) guy friend(Friends with the wife as well) pick up another lock set and install it for me as I am totally fried. It took me more than a few hours to sort everything out to where I can write it down. 

As for me, I'm hurt, upset, pissed, but I can smile, I have my dignity and I got just what I wanted.

First of all I?d like to give a big thank you to everyone who posted something helpful and constructive . Every comment was read, even the negative (unfortunately). I?ve gotten quite a few messages to post an update over the past month. I initially held off because I was nervous about the surprising amount of attention it got and didn?t know whether Lily was an avid redditor or not.

So, despite our protests, Lily ended up bringing her toddler Elle on our cottage getaway.

Just kidding!

Within 24 hours of me posting, three of us got together and read over all the messages (now my friends know my reddit username?.hiii guysss :/ ). We realized that we needed to get down to business and nip this situation in bud, before things escalated/we felt anymore resentment.

While this situation was happening, another one was going on on the side. My friend Ivy had made comments in the past about her and Lily drifting apart, as they are best friends. Quite understandably, Lily is SUPER busy being an awesome mom/fulltime employee so its hard getting friend time in. However, Ivy commented that they had only seen each other twice in past two and some months, and how she seemed like the only one ever making plans to hang out. She?s also the best communicator out of the group, so she decided that she would take it upon herself to speak with Lily directly that night. We didn't want to approach Lily as a group because it would have felt like we were attacking her, so we were more than happy with this approach.

From what I was told, she started off by casually bringing up the cottage and how much she was looking forward to it. Lily mentioned that she was excited to spend some time with all of us and that she couldn?t wait. Ivy then led the conversation in the direction of how she really loves spending time with Lily, that she wished it could happen more often, and even though she understood that Lily was a very busy gal, she felt like she was losing touch with Ivy somewhat.

Lily agreed, but reiterated that it is hard to find time for all the things that are important to her. So, Ivy continued and said something like, ?Hey, I am SO excited to be spending time with you at the cottage this summer. However, it kind of hurt my feelings that it took your fianc?e to be leaving for the weekend for you to decide to come and spend the weekend with us. (Not sure if I mentioned this in the first post, but initially Lily said no to the cottage because she wanted to focus on her family all summer. However, her fiancee wanted his own mini vacation, and when she found out it was on the same weekend as ours, she finally decided to come). But that?s okay, I understand that family time is very important to you. I just feel that since we haven?t been getting a lot of time to see you lately, the cottage weekend would be a great place for us all to reconnect. I feel like you need a break from life for just a couple days, since you?ve got so much going for you, and having Elle stay with your family friend while your fianc?e is away is the perfect opportunity for you to get some one on one time with us. What do you think??

So I?m excited to say that Lily finally saw the light and realized that yeah, this was a great opportunity to kick her feet back, relax, and made plans for Elle to stay with her family friend.

So some of you may be upset that we didn?t take the direct route that many of you were advising, demanding that Elle couldn?t come to the weekend getaway. However, we wanted to keep things calm/courteous and Ivy did a great job managing it. It might have been indirect, but it solved two problems in one.

All in all, the cottage was even more fun than last year! It was filled with many two-fours, midnight swims, silly truth or dares questions, and too many bags of sour cream and onion chips.

295,helpmethrowaway146,Updates,75qugw,2829,"Hi Reddit. A little while back I wrote here for advice. [Here is my initial post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73kzs8/me_33f_and_my_husband_34m_together_for_10_years/). I didn?t expect it to be nearly as big as I thought it would be. I went into it trying to reply to everyone, because I expected a handful of comments. I tried replying to as many of you as possible but I did miss some, I?m sorry! Besides a particular comment that accused me of sexually assaulting my husband (which has since been deleted) most of you guys really had helpful responses and anecdotes. I really appreciate that everyone took time out of their day to read through my post and give me advice.

On to the update. This feels a little messy, because I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts, and I apologise. But this update did not go as I expected. A commenter said that it sounded as if my husband directing his emotions about unrelated issues onto me. I replied to be polite, but honestly kind of put it out of my mind. My husband has never really done anything of the sort, and I had no reason to suspect he would do that now. Well, turns out that commenter is clairvoyant.

It turns out my husband?s mother has been diagnosed with a medical issue and does not have very long to live. She was initially in the hospital about 2 weeks before my post, which I knew. What I didn?t know is that the doctors found some things that gave her a very short life expectancy; they weren?t sure what the problem was, but they knew what the problem would lead to. I, and my husband's siblings, were told it wasn't a big deal.

My MIL didn?t want any of her kids to know until she was diagnosed properly with the real source of her issues. My FIL went against her wishes and told my husband, who convinced my FIL not to tell any of his other children. He also didn?t tell me, out of respect for his mother?s wishes, until a couple of days after my post. 

So obviously my husband had been going through a *lot* of emotional things, that he didn?t share with me out of respect for his dying mother. He felt he couldn?t disrespect her wishes after his father already did, so his worry and his inability to lean on me for support culminated in him struggling emotionally, which led to our minor argument.

We have been discussing that our communication suffered  ? and that it led to the conversation about which I asked for advice. That really hurt, and isn?t a good habit to have in a relationship. My husband had never done anything like this before, and he was quick to own up to responsibility about this. We?ve mostly been dealing with my MIL and trying to make her comfortable and happy, but we have spoken a little about what my post was about. As I said in my post, usually my touching wasn?t ?too much? for him at all. But if my touching is just too much right now because of everything else going on, that still needs to be addressed. My husband admitted that he usually loved it, but right now it felt like he was being overloaded with *stuff* and my touching contributed to that. He also admitted that he didn?t communicate that properly. We agreed that my husband would practice being more upfront and immediate about any discomfort I might bring if I helped him along by more regularly asking boundary questions when I *do* touch him, which I will of course be reigning in until he communicates that that can change.

We ended up agreeing that diversifying the way we show love would never be a bad thing. I showed him my post and we want to look through the love language stuff and communicate better about everything that I, and your advice, brought up in the post. But right now, we?re focusing on his mother, so we haven?t gone into it as deep as we?d like. 

So? a lot of what was in my post *is* a problem, but not as big of a problem as my husband initially made it seem like, and potentially it might be temporary (or it might not be). I?m just happy my husband and I are communicating again, so we can tackle everything as a team. We will still be looking through all of your great advice, but right now it?s just not a priority.

Thank you guys again. It?s only one update per post, so I won?t be able to update further along in the future when we?re more actively putting all your advice into practice, but I hope this update suffices.

**Tl;dr:** My husband was going through issues that led to our communication suffering. We?re dealing with that now, and it?s going pretty well.

I've known my friend since high school. We go to the same university, and we live close by so we walk home together every day.

Today, out of nowhere, he held my hand. He?s a really shy person so this was completely unexpected. He looked nervous, so I said that his warm hands felt nice on a cold day. He didn't expect me to reciprocate, and we just walked the rest of the way home in awkward silence.


I realized how nice it felt to hold his hand and how much I wanted to date him, so I sent this message to him shortly after arriving home:

?I really liked it when you held my hand today, and I want to talk about it.?

It's been a few hours and he hasn't replied back. I'm not the type of person that expects an instant reply, but he left me on read, and he usually gets back to me immediately.

We were also supposed to play league of legends today, but he wouldn't get on discord or reply to any of my mentions.

So what's happening here? Did I scare him away? Am I being really annoying by messaging him? Help!

I'm really thankful to everyone who answered and comforted me. You guys gave me the strength to look forward and not make a decision based on nostalgia. I felt really alone in my pain but thanks to you i felt a little less lonely.


So Mark wanted to meet on sunday but i unblocked him from my phone and told him i didn't want to meet and to please not contact me anymore, he answered ""Please baby i need to talk to you, can we meet another day? I know i fucked up really bad and hurt you deeply but i'll do anything to make it up to you, anything you ask i'll do it...'' needless to say it just angered me more, how dare he use terms of endearment with me. I just blocked him again after that. I met his mom on saturday and told her to proceed with the notification of cancellation. We had an emotional moment and she told me even though she would have really wanted us to stay ''One big family'', she would have done the same in my place. She had hoped i would find the strength to forgive him but she understands. And so the wedding is indeed still being cancelled. My poor brother ( i told him personally) had already bought his plane tickets from Australia but got a refund. I rearranged all the furnitures in the house and bought new bedding sets, to make a new start and moved to the spare room for good. It looks really different and i like it. Apparently he told our friends because some brought it up to me, asking if we are getting back together, but said they ''didn't want to side''. 

On sunday evening i had a visitor. I never have people coming this late usually, it was around 9pm. When i went to look through the peephole i saw Mark, **with his ex**. I seriously had a moment of panick. He must still have the key for the main entry since he managed to get to my door without using the intercom. I don't know if it was a coward thing to do but i just chose not to open. I know they knew i was there and i heard him ask me to ''Please let him in, that he just wanted to talk'' through the door. Honestly even though i feel better i don't think i'm emotionally stable enough to deal with him and especially him with his ex. They stayed about 15 minutes and then they left. I thought he would get the message but they came again yesterday around the same time!! And i didn't open again. They waited even longer. I know i'm not being an adult.


So now i don't know what to do. I feel nervous in my own house because i dread the moment they'll come back. He knows my schedule and he came at the time where i usually come back from my zumba class. However yesterday was a holiday so we didn't have class. I'm afraid he will come again and i don't think i can face him. What should i do? I know i can't run away forever but i need more time. Is this worth calling the police over? I fear it would make the problem bigger than it is and hurt our family relations, our moms are really close. And really he is not dangerous, i think. He didn't contact me enough for it to be considered harassment anyway. Should i just be a big girl and open the next time he or they come? Or do i wait it out? Also why the hell is he bringing her? I'm curious but i want to stand by my decision.


**tl;dr: I decided not to take him back and told his mom to send the notification of cancellation to the guests. I refused to meet him on sunday but he came in the evening with his ex and again yesterday night. What should i do. Can i just keep on avoiding them or do i have to have that talk i do not want to have?**

tl;dr: Husband has spent a lot of time and money helping his pregnant coworker. This makes me uncomfortable, but he says I am being greedy for trying to discourage him from doing a good deed. Am I worrying over nothing, or are my concerns justified?

***
Since many of you asked for an update, and you were kind enough to offer advice, I have decided to give one. 

The first thing I did after making my initial post was to confront my husband directly again. I asked him point blank if he was so involved with Kelsey's pregnancy because he was the father of her child. He denied it. I then asked him to introduce me to Kelsey since he had given her money that belonged to both of us. When I mentioned this, he got very defensive and accused me of being insecure. I responded by saying that I at least had a right to know the person I was helping and that he shouldn't have a problem with me meeting Kelsey if nothing was going on between them. He then told me that he wasn't going to introduce us and that I needed to work on my jealousy issues. 

I decided to contact Kelsey the next day. I found her, or at least the woman I thought was her, through a mutual friend's Facebook page. I sent her a message telling her who I was. I explained to her why I was concerned about her relationship with my husband and requested that she please let me know if she was having my husband's baby. 

She sent me a very nasty message back. I will spare you many of the details. The basic gist was that I was old and unattractive and unable to satisfy my husband, so he found someone better (i.e., Kelsey). Among other things, she claimed that the baby was my husband's and that he was planning to leave me but felt sorry for me and couldn't bring himself to do it. She ended the message by telling me that I should let him go so they could be together. It hurt a lot to read that message. It still hurts me to think about it. 

I confronted my husband that same night. I showed him the message. He got really quiet and admitted that she was telling the truth but denied telling her all of the horrible things she said about me. He said it (getting her pregnant) was a mistake and he was only trying to do the right thing by her and the baby. He denied that they were still sleeping together and said he wanted to stay with me and have a baby with me. I have no idea if either of these things are true.  

I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Everything has happened so fast. A couple of days have passed now, and I'm still thinking things over. He wants us to go to counseling to try to work through this, but I don't think I'm interested in working on our marriage. It would be hard for me to get past this if he had cheated, but the fact that he may be having a child with this woman makes it harder. If I stay with him, she's always going to be in our lives. I have thought about waiting until we can do a paternity test to make a final decision, but I don't know if I want to do that either. It may be easier if I just make the change now. I have started looking for divorce attorneys. Most of my family and friends have told me I need to get out of this marriage, and each day I get closer to making that move. I just need a bit more time before I'm ready to make a decision.

First, I just wanted to say thank you to all that replied and sent me personal messages regarding this issue of mine. You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.

After I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fianc?e. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.

So I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.

The evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with ""Are you sure you don't have a fianc?e?"" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. 

I took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.

We talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.

It wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.

We may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.

I don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.

Hey guys - so I just wanted to update some of the people who commented and gave me some insight. All of your comments were really appreciated and definitely helped me think. 

So for the last week my ex has been staying with family when hes not at work and we have been sharing time with Sarah. We met up this weekend to talk about everything and our life plan. He basically said that he does still love me, but that his schedule is just not something that can change for him anytime soon. I am trying to be understanding and supportive, because I do want to be with him and Sarah. We are going to look into counseling for us as a couple, and also family counseling for the three of us.

I did bring up legal adoption of Sarah. I was shocked when he said he was thinking of the same thing. He said that no matter what happens with us as a couple he always wants me to be a parental figure to Sarah. We had both hoped that someday I would adopt her, we just didn't see us breaking up or it becoming an issue. I am so glad we are on the same page about that. I am over the moon and were going to meet with a lawyer on Friday to get the ball rolling on that. 


I am hoping that this relationship can be saved because I really do feel like I have a family with them. My number one priority throughout this has been Sarah, and I am cant even explain how happy I am that I will get to legally be her parent. I know I wont ever be her mother but I'm glad that we will be together no matter what.

Thanks Reddit! Sorry this is kind of all over the place. We're still figuring everything out, but I wanted to update!

tl;dr: We are going to start couples and family counseling, as well as beginning the process for legal adoption!


Edit: Thank you so much for all your comments. This got bigger than I expected. Thanks for all the kind words. To people think that I am being taken advantage of for free child care please realize that I've happily cared for Sarah for the last 5 years and have no problem continuing to do so. To whoever gilded me for this thank you so much! ",1510758875.0,UPDATE: My (29F) ex boyfriend (32M) moved out with daughter (6F). I am devastated and don't know what to do.,0.96

So it's been about 9 months and though my original post didn't get a lot of comments, but I always appreciate updates and want to do the same.

&#x200B;

After being kicked out my mom moved her stuff to storage and moved her, my brother and pets into her sister's camping trailer for the time being. They were there for about 4 or 5 months, while my brother finished high school and during the summer I got to help them move into a place rented out by an old friend of my mom's for a lot cheaper than what the rent usually is for the area. But he started to get weird and moved friend into the backyard (he lived on the property as well) and then decided to rent the place out to someone else after my mom was living there for about 3 months. Finally my mom found out a family member had a duplex for rent and she's moved in there.

All while this was happening my grandfather decided that being a jerk to my mom would somehow help her? He was unsupportive of my mom from the start and blamed her for getting kicked out. He tried to get us to move into his and my grandmother's place for a few months but as soon as we started moving stuff in he would make snide comments about how he didn't expect us to move stuff in (which is a lie, him and my grandma talked about it multiple times), and was just a jerk the entire time. So that's when my mom asked her old friend for help instead of moving in with her parents. Ever since, my mom has tried to contact him by wishing him happy birthdays, etc and he won't respond. It has gotten so bad that I finally snapped last month and laid into him, now he won't respond to me and says my mom has brainwashed us. So Thanksgiving should be interesting this year haha.

I haven't heard from my mom's ex boyfriend and don't care to. We heard he is seeing someone else and has been for a few months but will try to still text or call my mom. My mom is cordial with him since she still cares about him but she is enjoying focusing on herself and getting to explore what she likes to do again.

My mom is doing well. She has had some crazy stuff besides getting kicked out happen to her. She had a sort of skin cancer (not dangerous but still scared us until we knew what it was), her friend died, our cat that we have had for 17 years died, and now she has to have back surgery. But with finally being in a place where she can stay for as long as she wants, she's excited. She has been talking about starting online school after her back surgery and my brother is staying with her for awhile so they can both save up.

As for myself, it's been rough but I realized I needed to seek some help feeling so overwhelmed. So I'm seeing a therapist and making sure to take care of myself while still being there for my family. My original post was a lot of me freaking out but everyone is doing well despite all the bad circumstances.

Thank you to all the people who commented or offered advice. I appreciate it!

Mom has had some health issues but now that she's found a place she's getting those taken care of and is working on doing things she's wanted to do for awhile (schooling, new job, and dating again).

&#x200B;

I talked a bit with Derek on Discord and apologized for things coming out this way, especially since he was recovering from a breakup. He was really chill and empathetic about it. He invited me out to drinks later that week and since, well, everything was already known it was actually pretty easy to talk to him about it, and we laughed it off. I let him know I was still into him but wanted to give him space and also didn't want to complicate our friendship. He was very kind and affirming about it.

&#x200B;

Later that night, he asked if I wanted to kiss and I say said hell yes, so we made out a bit - it was amazing. We made plans to hang out later that week and one thing led to another and we did the monster mash. It was a graveyard smash. :) Our friendship seems to have deepened a bit as a result and I'm super happy with the FWB arrangement. I'm doubtful that the future will hold any further romance between us other than physical, but honestly I'm pretty happy with it?

&#x200B;

My sister and I also talked it out and everything is good between us now - she apologized, agreed to start therapy (recognizing the pattern of her going after people I like) and has been checking in with me to make sure I'm okay.

Hey guys, sorry for taking so long to update, I didn?t speak with him at that dinner bc there were a lot of people and I didn?t felt confortable.

Unfortunaly things with my family escalated as this kind of things do. I?m fine as I already have some experience with them going crazy lol. My poor brother, on the other hand, was completely blindsided but we talked and I helped him set up some security devices/tips to avoid our parents.

This did made things take a weird twist and now the whole family is convinced I somehow turned my brother gay(which, ignoring the glaring HOW, is the why I?d do this) and I?m the bad influence. Nothing like waking up to your mom blowing your phone saying you?re going to hell eh?

My brother is pretty shocked and confused. This, at least, gave me the opportunity(after a couple of beers) to talk with him about our family, how I was treated and so. He was pretty heart broken and feeling guilty but I did my best to show him it wasn?t his fault.

I think this conversation really made us closer and made me feel more at ease with the situation. A week or so later he asked if I was alright(I tend to freeze when I?m awkward) and I explained I was a bit intimidated by awesome-ness(not like this lol). He was actually very understanding and said he knew exactly how I felt. Then he started talking a bit about his fuck ups and how he screwed things up.

This helped a lot to take him off the pedestal I had put him in. Right now our relationship is great, I regularly have dinner with them, they met my friends and we?re both supportive of each other situation with our family. I don?t think he?s going to return contact with them, at least until they truly apologize, stop blaming me and accept his husband.

Overall, I?m still not sure of what the future holds, I?m still awkward and kinda flopping around life trying to do things but I?m not so insecure and now I know I have my brother to help me out.

Thanks for all the advices guys!

It took a few days to digest what a lot of people were saying.  At the end of the day I hoped to approach the situation as me wanting to be close to my family again and basically trying to ignore the money part.  For the next couple of weeks if I wanted to talk to my mother I made sure to call at a time I knew she wasn't swamped with work (either before she left for the day or before going to bed) and if anything to do with money came up, it was treated as a side note. ""Oh dad won 4k last night online? That's awesome for him. Where are you travelling for work tomorrow? Have you been there before? Are you looking forward to it?"" and she just sort of.. opened up. I told her how I was feeling slighted, fully addressed the issue and even told her how I felt the slight favoritism towards my brother, because he was present, was getting to me. 

My mother is an extremely intelligent woman, reading back on my posts I think I stressed this a lot but she really, really is. We had our one super feelsy chat and moved on but she's been going out of her way to show me she's serious this time with actions not just words. I was over recently and before she dropped me off at home (we live about an hour away from one another) she stopped to at a store and remarked ""your dad and brother lost 600$ last night online, what kind of fucked up logic is it that I can't afford to buy you some groceries?"" . Our upcoming Christmas plans, which I was dreading, are now actual plans. She's picked out a theme for before and after dinner, neither which involve gambling, and is incredibly focused on us spending time away from a computer screen. Our gift exchange is a 20$ limit and she found some game online so that nothing is tailored towards anyone and we all feel included. She's been providing ideas for the wedding planning and even called me the other day saying ""Well you call me all the time and I was thinking about you so I thought I'd call you!"" just to chat. Overall... Im kind of stoked about where this is going. It's only been less then a month but I've never known my mother to commit to something and not stick with it so, I'm remaining hopeful.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on my first post. For the past week, I've been trying to focus on myself and my work and not care about my ex and my boss who's dating her. It worked pretty well, I started a painting and I'm pretty close to finishing it and I impressed my boss boss (the professor who owns the lab, not the one dating my ex) by staying late for two days in a row to finish a really difficult experiment. During our lab meeting, my boss boss shouted me out in front of the entire lab and said he was really impressed by my hard-work and dedication. That felt good.

As for the situation with my boss and my ex, he found out. Like I mentioned in my previous post, when my ex told me who her new boyfriend was, I didn't mention that he was my boss so neither of them knew. Two days ago, my boss and us (two other undergrads) were in a conference room discussing a paper when my ex came in. She came to drop off my boss's wallet that I think he forgot or something. Anyway, she saw me, did a double-take and went, ""Jaaaake?!"". She was definitely super surprised and caught off-guard and her boss was already like ""wtf"" so I was just like, ""heeeyy 'Sarah'"". She shot me another shocked wide-eyed look and left. Suffice to say the rest of the meeting was pretty awkward. 

The next day, it was obvious that my boss now knew our history. Things just turned so awkward. Like he didn't now how to act around me anymore and what to say. Now we're both awkward around each other. He's still nice and all but things are just uncomfortable between us two now. It's not his fault though. I think that things will get better between the two of us but as of right now, I actually feel kind of relieved that he now knows. Something about how both of us now don't know how to act and what to do kind of makes me feel reassured.

""Sarah"" also called me the night that she found out I worked there but I missed her call and forgot to call back. It's good though, I've been trying to think of her less and distance myself a bit.  

But if things continue to remain really awkward to the point where both of our work is affected, I'll consider talking to my boss boss about switching me to work under another grad student instead. 

But yea, that's about all. Again, thanks for the help guys.

TL;DR: Been focusing on myself and my work. Boss found out that I'm his girlfriend's ex and things are now awkward but bearable.

So I went to see my dad and it basically went like shit. I caved, I fucking caved and decided fuck it, I'll see what he wants. Maybe this is something worth hearing. I visited the hospital by myself. Now wife. No mom. No sisters. Just him and I.





He looked old and tired and just as I predicted I didn't find it in me to be angry, this wasn't the man I remembered, this was just some old broken man. It would have been a waste of my time to feel angry and yet I did. I was so pissed off because I couldn't stand across from him eye to eye and let him see that the son he treated like dogshit had built a wonderful life for himself.






We didn't say anything to each other for around an hour. Then eventually I found my voice and said ''you know this is the last time we'll ever see each other right?'' No response. Then he replied ''I know.''



So I asked him why now? Why did he want to see me so badly that he had to send a message through my mother for me?





And here is where I learnt that my existence was fuck all to him. He admitted that he did it just to give my mom closure, she didn't ask him to do it but he knew she wanted it. 


So I asked him why he treated me the way he did my whole life and he replied, **''I never wanted a son, never had any interest in one.''** It fucking hurt but I kept listening and he kept speaking. He said that in the first few years of my life he tried his best to care about me but eventually he realized he couldn't. Then came the final nail in the coffin of my relationship with that man.




**I never loved you but I didn't hate you either, I just didn't care for you because I never wanted a son, I wanted to give you up for adoption when you were younger but your mother would never have forgiven me, so I did my best to push you aside and you would always try and get my approval for stuff, I felt bad at times but I just didn't care for you** 




By that time I was crying, me a 31 year old man, left my dying father in his hospital room and went to my car crying. I could have gone my whole life not knowing that. Fuck my mom, my sisters, my wife and my dad. I'm just so pissed right now. 





There was a part of me that hoped we would bury the hatchet, nope, I just learnt he never gave a fuck. 




I will never speak of my father again. I will not attend his funeral or visit his grave. When he dies I'll be at the bar drinking because the fucker is gone from this world and I will do everything I can to be the father he never was.




**TL;DR visited dying dad, found out he never wanted a son, wanted to put me up for adoption, didn't love me, didn't hate me, just never cared about me**





EDIT:-  **I just want to say thanks to everyone for your kind words, both in comments and pms, they really helped a lot, particularly while I was hung over this morning and laying in bed thinking about life. Also to the stranger who gave me gold, thank you, never had that before and it was quite unexpected.**


**I've got a ways to go still, I feel like yesterday opened up wounds I didn't even realized had never really healed and I'll be talking to my wife about it and most likely a professional as well. I won't cut my mom or sisters out, I am not angry at them, their experiences with my father were different from my own and I do not fault them for that, however, right now, the best thing for me, is just to not be around them as much. So I don't think they'll be seeing/hearing from me for some time.**


**Once again, I sincerely thank everybody, it was your comments and pms that made me realize, yeah it hurts like shit, but I can't let him have anymore power over me, I'm in the prime of my life and I've built a nice life for myself. I don't need a dying man's approval anymore because I've done the best I could for so long without it anyway, so here's hoping things will get better soon.**

&#x200B;

My last post 2 years ago about dating with health issues got quite a bit of attention (thank you reddit so much for the moral support and great advice, it really helped me feel less alone!)

&#x200B;

I was in two minds about whether to post an update here or not, but I know that when I was all cut up about my invisible illness affecting my dating life it was really hard to find success stories where people met their partners AFTER diagnosis. So I?m posting it just in case even one person in a similar situation gets the moral boost they need.

&#x200B;

2 years ago I was really struggling with both my mental and physical health. They both spiralled off each other (as invisible illnesses tend to do, unfortunately) and it was really hard for me to improve the home life situation that was definitely not helping matters. I love my grandparents to bits, and I?m very grateful for all the care they provided, but living in an isolated town in the middle of nowhere with only them for company made it very difficult to meet new people or do the few activities I?m still able to do.

&#x200B;

Moving to somewhere bigger and with a population closer to my age has definitely been a big factor in improved dating success. It sounds obvious, I know, but it?s not an easy thing to uproot when you?re disabled. But if you?re isolated and find it hard to meet people because there?s nothing to get out the house for, it?s such a boost in quality of life. Now there are places to go and do things/meet new people. There are actually people my own age there to meet!

&#x200B;

Meeting people in person also made it easier to have that conversation about my health more organically and casually; preferably after they?ve got to chat with me and know me a bit first too. Online dating works for some people, sure, but I think it?s way less stressful getting to know someone as a friend first and hang out in person without pressure instead of meeting up with a stranger and wondering whether you?ll even want to sit through the whole date (and stress is of course a health trigger). I know I certainly didn?t have the energy needed to sift through the numbers game that is online dating ? I know some single friends who would have one good date for every ten or so dates through apps.

&#x200B;

I met my current boyfriend at a board games caf?. Somewhere I could get out, but that wasn?t too taxing (sitting down is a lot less taxing on my pain and fatigue than active sports for example). We got chatting, became friends pretty quickly. He was super oblivious to all my definitely-not-subtle flirting attempts, so at first I figured he just wasn?t interested (especially as he knew about my fibro). Turns out he was just very shy and not wanting to misread anything.

&#x200B;

We?ve talked about my health and he knows he can ask my any questions he wants about it. But honestly, he?s been really amazing and understanding about it in a way I never thought anyone would be. He pre-empts issues before they even have a chance to come up (noticing if the heating turns off too early and grabbing a blanket because he knows the cold makes me worse) and mentally plans out our time together around ?Well if we do this on that day, we?ll have a chill day in the next day because you?ll be exhausted?.

&#x200B;

It?s still relatively early days, but I wanted to let fellow spoonies know that there are people out there who don?t freak out at health conditions. There are so many support groups and articles online from the perspective of dating/married life when you?re already together and get the diagnosis, so someone?s already invested and supportive. The amount of times I?ve heard ?I don?t know how I?d cope without my partner? has been so demoralising as a single person who struggled to find anyone.

&#x200B;

So, for anyone who?s going through a hard time right now with their health, or struggling with being single ? don?t give up! Do everything you can to create opportunities for you to meet new people, or even just leave the house with friends and ask them to invite some of their friends you haven?t met yet. It?s scary, yes, and it might be a narrower scope on what you?re physically able to leave the house and do, but even something low key like going to the library, a caf?, a book club, etc is a good place to start.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: After struggling with dating since my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, I?ve successfully been in a relationship for a couple of months now and am super happy about it!

Hi everyone, I wanted to post an update since so many people requested one in the first post. I know it's been quite some time, but a lot has happened and it finally calmed down enough that I could find the time to post.

Good news, husband's mom is now in an appropriate home. We were able to find a place about an hour drive from where we live that was $7k a month and that had pretty great reviews. We obviously toured it first and talked to the staff and asked extensively about activities, cleaning schedules, food, etc. Mother-in-law was moved in this week. We were really lucky, because of our location there wasn't a long waiting list and there were several openings this month alone. It also helped we had a strong referral from her long time physician (the one who actually told us about this place to begin with).

So basically what happened after that post-

I called Mike and told him we needed to talk when he got home. When he got in we sat in my study and I laid it out for him. I told him exactly how I felt about the situation, told him it was enough. I showed him some printouts of information I had on Alzheimer units surrounding us, even articles on coping with having a parent going through this. 

Long story short- we got into an argument. He accused me of being unsupportive, being selfish, etc. I refused to take it. I have been the one to stay home and babysit his increasingly sick mother all day, not him. I told him that and that if he was so dedicated to having her stay in the house, *he* could be the one to take care of her. I was at the absolute limit. 

I packed a bag and checked myself into one of the nicer hotels. I went out and bought some bath bombs and wine and for the first time in a long time I just had time for me. I was able to sit on my laptop and actually get ahead on my work. He was of course texting me and calling but it was just to continue his tirade, which I could happily ignore for the time being. I knew that he would soon be seeing things in a much different light.

It seriously took only two days. He begged me to come home. He told me he was sorry and that he didn't know just how bad it was. I told him he'd have to do better than that and to actually take her to the doctors and get that referral so we could have her moved to long-term care ASAP. Make an appointment at a home. Start prepping her for the move. Until then, I wasn't checking out of my newly found peace and quiet.

He actually came through. Her physician, a really really great guy btw who also had a parent go through this, got us fast tracked for this place. I think that paired with Mike seeing his moms actions really helped to open his eyes to the reality of the situation. She wasn't just ""a little off"". She was actually a danger to herself. 

I also talked to my husband about getting therapy. I told him it would be normal to have feelings of guilt or sadness over this and that I thought he should take the time to see someone. I offered to go with him if he wanted me to be there. He said he would think about it and I decided not to push it. I will take it up with him again though if I see he's not doing well because of it.

He cried a lot the day we had to take her in. When we got home we had a long talk about how he felt and he told me he was sorry he said I was selfish or uncaring. He said he realized how much I must have cared to do that for him for 3 months. I told him it doesn't mean someone doesn't care when they have to just admit they can't handle something. There are professionals for a reason, we're just not them. 

So that's where we're at right now. This week is more about everything settling down, him getting used to his mom being away, me getting the house back to normal and getting back into routine. I've left her belongings in the room she was occupying so he could still have that piece of her and we could bring things to her as necessary. They gave us a list of clothing items needed, but it was mostly comfortable housewear like pjs and slippers and since it's not winter yet nothing bulky like sweaters or coats. I had to have the mattress replaced in her room though because she had wet the bed often and not said anything so it was destroyed. I cleaned up her bathroom and just tidied the room up in general so it was livable again. 

I want to say thanks to everyone who weighed in. So much good advice and words I much needed to hear in that original thread. Thank you to everyone who shared their personal story and gave their suggestions on how to help husband cope. Hopefully from here on out things can be a lot more stable. It's definitely not easy and I wish that in a perfect world none of this would have to be happening, but it already feels so much better this way. 




   
**tl;dr**: My husband finally saw the light and we moved his mom to an appropriate Alzheimer unit where she will get the assistance she needs.

310,TallRadiography,Updates,7h7gxu,2753,"Hi everyone, I'm back. I can't say this update is an uplifting one, but I think it's okay for what it is, and what happened. [Original is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fg9gw/my_moms_61f_grieving_for_my_sister_29f_makes_me/)

Here's the old summary: My mom won't let us do family traditions after my sister's passing, and I'm worried she may not be doing other things. How can I get her to start feeling better and recovering?

Anyways, on my mom's last day in town, I took her to the cemetery where Diana is buried, since it was just more practical for her to be buried near to us. She didn't want to go through the gate, because she'd never visited the grave. Even when the funeral was held, she didn't want to go because she didn't want it to be real. I waited for her for about thirty minutes, then decided to go on without her so I could at least see Diana's grave. After another thirty minutes, my mom came and joined me. She started sobbing that it wasn't real, that it was all a bad dream.

I just sat there and let her cry. I'd watched Diana die- I knew it was real. So, I just let her try and understand what I knew all along. It made me feel like a robot. I felt even worse when I looked at her headstone, and just felt nothing. Obviously, I miss and love my sister, but I just didn't feel *sad*. It just felt like looking at a stranger's headstone, and thinking, ""Hey, we have the same last name.""

My mom eventually wore herself out, and just hugged the headstone and sat there, sniffling. I got up and started to look around, checking out the other gravestones. I have no idea what happened, but I was staring at a headstone, and doing some mental math to find out how old the person was. They were thirty. All of a sudden, I just started bawling. I was thinking about how excited my sister was to turn thirty, and I realized she would never get to turn thirty. I sat in front of a total stranger's headstone, and cried like a baby.

Eventually, I managed to get back to my mom, and we held each other for a while and cried together. She told me she loved me, and I told her I loved her. We just stood there for a long time, then my mom told me she wanted me to have ""my moment"" with my sister, and went off to a different part of the cemetery. I sat with the headstone for a while, and just started talking about my life. I talked about my job, my lack of success on Tinder, how badly I wanted a cat but my apartment complex didn't let us have animals. I kept waiting for her to tease me, or tell me I was being ridiculous, but she didn't say anything, and I just broke down in tears every time I finished a sentence.

I went to find my mom after sitting there for about forty-five minutes. We went to go get breakfast at a nearby diner. I asked my mom what she was doing since Diana died. She said she'd been going to her counselor, but also found a local group of grieving parents who do a group therapy thing. I asked if she had hobbies outside of Diana. She said that she did what she did before Diana died, and I asked her to do something like scrapbooking, or cooking, or just take a class. I even offered to pay, and that snapped my mom out of it pretty quickly- she swatted at me and told me not to pay for her.

Once she got home, she signed up for a meditation class, and at my request- also started taking an art class at her local rec center. I like to think she's doing a bit better. The other day, she sent me a picture of me and Diana from the day she moved out. It was really sweet, and I asked her to send me a physical copy so I could frame it. I think I'm also doing better. I visited Diana last night, and I felt really good. I brought her some flowers, and I just stayed and chatted for a little bit.

I got myself into a grief handling program, and I'm excited to attend my first group therapy session. This festered in me for a long time, and I let myself believe I was okay because we didn't have a ""real bond."" But we did, and I loved her, and I've been trying to heal in a way that was just... Going through the motions. I had to let my world stop turning for a while, and experience it like my mother did.

Before that visit to the cemetery, I would cook for myself every night. Since then, I've been going through frozen meals like crazy. I would shower everyday, make sure I curled my hair every morning, wore matching socks even if my boots were too high for anyone to see. Now, I let my hair get kind of gross and let it stay straight for a while. I drag whatever socks I can get out of my dryer. I let myself be sad, and gross, and ugly, and unfortunate. I eat lunch by myself at work somedays, and hide in the bathroom when I feel grief coming on. I've ripped the band-aid off, and am letting all the bacteria and ick get into the cut before I pour hydrogen peroxide in it and let it really be fixed. 

It's bedtime for me now, but thank you to everyone who reached out and commented and was kind. And to the people who weren't, thanks for still taking time out of your day.

**TL;DR; from first post:** Toxic relationship becoming too much for me to handle, and I'm confused about my role in it. Am I a horrible person? What do I do? 

I'm sorry for leaving you guys hanging yesterday. I was trying to be vague in the last post because I know my boyfriend had mentioned in passing that he kept an eye on this sub in case I ever posted, but I didn't realize he meant that he checked at every single break. He was able to find it anyway so now it doesn't matter. 

**I'm okay, just to get that out of the way! First of all, wow.... you guys, thank you so much. I haven't read all the comments yet because I had no idea this would get so big, but thank you.. you are all such wonderful people. To everyone who offered me a place to stay or a ride, I can't thank you enough... Just knowing that there are people out there who would help a complete stranger is very touching and I wish  I could tell you how much I appreciate every single one of you... thank you.**

To those of you saying I'm abusive for posting this, hell, I didn't mean it that way, but maybe? I didn't plan for or want him to see it but I can see what you mean.  

Anyway, last night was probably the biggest night of my life so bear with me if it starts getting too long.

I've been in therapy for the last three years and one of the things my therapist had me do was get a backpack ready with everything I might need in an emergency. Within two minutes of receiving his text yesterday and posting the edit I grabbed that backpack and was planning on just walking so at least I wasn't home(I don't have a car) I was thinking about just going through my contacts and talking to who ever I could but that didn't work out.

Josh was outside parked down the street!! He was trying to catch me leaving! So when he sent the text that said ?saw your post I'm coming home? he was **ALREADY** home. He was fucking waiting.

I just stood there cause I didn't know what to do, I thought he was going to be furious but he ran up to me with a completely different react than I expected... he was crying, like balling his eyes out. I still felt like I was waiting for him to get mad or scream at me or something but he just hugged me really tight and said he's so sorry. He said he had no idea I felt that way and that he knows he has jealousy issues and a temper and asked if we could talk about it inside. He begged me to come in and said he couldn't lose me and he loves me.

I didn't know what to do, I just followed him in. He took my backpack from me and when he looked at it he just broke down. He asked if I was really leaving him, why I didn't tell him things were this bad, why I never talk to him....

I told him I can't talk to him. Every time I have ever decided to trust him and open up about even the tiniest thing that's bothered me (like him asking for other girls' numbers in front of me or him hanging up on me constantly) he always loses his shit and starts screaming at the top of his lungs while I just sit there as quiet as possible and apologize. And then this is where he changed, at this point he was no longer acting like he was sorry, he'd switched to ?you're full of shit, I treat you like a goddamn angel and get walked all over in return.? He said he should never have to apologize to me.

I was very upset so I played one of the fights I recorded and I'm so glad I kept those after he told me to delete them... Even in the first three minutes of it you can tell I was being calm, the first thing I say is ?baby, I didn't mean to say anything was wrong with us, I just wanted to know why you don't want me to apply at [place I could use my degree]. I just want to help make money.? He immediately starts yelling ?you'll cheat on me and find someone better! Fuck off, go find some guy to fuck at [place]. I don't give a fuck you'll come crawling back to me, no one else would put up with you! FUCK YOU!? This fight was pretty recent but he only listened to a few seconds of it. 

(I know some people who commented on the last post suggested that maybe I really am screaming back at him ? someone said something about slapping him too, neither of us have ever slapped the other though ? and I understand that may be something to consider. But I know that I don't yell. I have a hard time standing up for myself and I hate confrontation, especially with him. I always just want to make the fights better. I know I need to work on that, and I've brought it up in therapy before, but I just felt like adding that)


He got up and said ?fuck off with that shit.? 
He was definitely not apologetic and sweet anymore so I was just quiet. He said he's done with this shit and I have no right to record him and then he ripped the phone out of my hand. He said more stuff but I can't remember everything. I asked what he was doing, but he just glared at me and then he stomped outside with it and then threw it as hard as he could. I don't know why but that just broke my heart so much, he's broken things of mine before but I had been planning on calling a friend or my brother and I didn't know any of their numbers. I asked him what he did with it but he wouldn't answer.

He slammed the door so hard when he came in that I flinched, then he bumped into me really roughly and went straight to his computer where he put his headphones on and turned up his music really loud. (He always put his headphones on in a certain way when he's mad, cause then he can't hear me) He started playing a game and he was literally fuming. I stood in the door and he looked up at me and the way he looked at me was awful. I could feel that he absolutely hated me, and what's sad is that wasn't even the first time he's looked at me that way. I think I was kind of in shock, I always feel that way when he's mad. He kept playing games so I went out to look for my phone, which I found parts of shattered on the street but I never found the battery and I don't think it was usable. When I went back in I was shaking :[

We talked it out later I think everything is going to be okay.


*Just kidding.*

I don't know why but I just felt so done, I grabbed his phone off the counter and ran outside. I knew he used to text my brother and he had the number of the friend I watched a movie with a while back (to make sure I was where I said I was) so I used his to call them.
My brother answered on the second ring and I didn't know what to say so I just started pouring my heart out, I told him I'm sorry we haven't talked in so long, but that I'm really scared and have no where to go.

Guys, this hurt more than anything my boyfriend has ever said or done and I'm still so surprised that he would have this reaction after so long...  I can't remember the beginning but the last thing he said was ?you deserve everything that's happening to you? and hung up. 

He hates me. He really thinks I deserve to stay with Josh because I'm attracted to girls. 

At the time I just thought fuck him and I called my friend (who I'll call A). Well she didn't answer at first, but then she called right back! Thank you all so much for suggesting that I call her because she was so happy to hear from me and I told her everything that happened, she said she was 30 minutes away and she would come with her husband (I didn't even know she had gotten married! :[ ) so I went back in and oh my god that was a horrible 30 minutes. I didn't what to do I was so fucking worried he'd come out because I didn't want to see him (I'm a bad liar and he'd know something was up) . I didn't want him to notice my stuff all packed up so I just put all my cords/controllers/clothes and small things I couldn't live without in a box but left the big stuff. A got there really fast and her husband (who is such a nice guy) helped me load my desk/chair and computer in their truck.

This is the part I'm not feeling so great about right now.

I left without saying a word to Josh. 

I could still hear him playing games in the other room and the only thing I wanted in the entire world was for him to hug me and tell me it was okay and ?wow my heart really hurts today, I can't even see through the tears to type this out.. I know how he sounded but I really loved him so much and it feels like I ripped my own limb off... When I think about his face and smile and everything that was good I feel like there's a huge hole in my chest. 

But when I play these fights I recorded, and think about my future and this amazing friend who came and saved me and everything I can do with my life... I feel so happy. I thought I needed Josh, but man.. it's so amazing feeling like I don't. I have to get a new phone, though :[

Thank you all so much, you are all amazing people. I received so many thoughtful messages and I can't tell you how thankful I am that I ended up posting here.

I'm with A now, and she lives in a house I've never been to so I'm pretty sure Josh won't find it. And she invited another girl I haven't seen in years to go to a concert on friday night and I am so excited! We had strawberry daiquiris and watched stupid horror movies all night and her husband is making waffles right now!





Guys... I'm free. I'm so fucking happy. I'M FUCKING FREE!!

It's been about 10 weeks since my post. Here's what happened. 

The evening after I made that post, I told my husband there is no way we will be able to work everything out on our own, and we need to go to counseling. He reluctantly agreed. 

We started couples counseling the very next week. It's realy quite strange how counseling has progressed. 

1. My husband made one change - stopping with the yelling - immediately and totally. He hasn't yelled at me over little things for weeks now. 

2. BUT I have progressively gotten more and more angry with, disappointed in, and disconnected from him because of everything he's said and done during these weeks in counseling.... which also caused me to sort of wake up to all that he has done in the past. I have an appointment with a lawyer next week. We are done. 

\#2 takes a bit of explanation, so here goes. 

I am quite stunned by how little effort this guy is willing to put into the relationship in spite of so desperately wanting to hold on to it. So he made one change - the end of all yelling. I was really, really relieved and grateful and impressed.... until he started complaining (about 4 days in!) that he was putting in all the effort and seeing ""negative returns"". This has remained his stance for all these 10-11 weeks. 

I am flabbergasted. Our couples counselor has straight up said to him: ""I am supposed to be neutral here but on this I am comfortable saying you are WRONG, she is making a huge effort at this relationship and you need to know that."" But in private my husband dismisses everything I'm doing as ""intangible"" or ""selfish"" and therefore not real. And he complains nonstop that I'm not my ""usual self"" i.e. the doormat who danced around managing his feelings and walking on eggshells all the time. ""This is not the person I fell in love with,"" he keeps saying. ""Why should I bother making all this effort?"" 


For my part, yes, I am not the person he fell in love with. The couples counselor told me to stop trying to manage his feelings for him and try to be myself - and I took that very seriously. I no longer try to read his mood all the time and tiptoe around him. I no longer try to intuit when he is angry or hurt and ask him what's wrong and try to cajole him into working things out. I leave it to him to bring it up with me if something is bothering him. If he's in a bad mood and sulking, I just leave him alone and go on with my own thing until he wants to talk. If he is stonewalling me, which he has started doing for a few days after every single counseling session, I no longer let it affect my mood. This seems to be making him feel completely unloved and abandoned - which I only know because he has broken down and cried and yelled at me after the stonewall. ""You don't care about me anymore."" And I've been saying, ""If something is bothering you, you need to tell me. I won't read your mind. And I won't cave to your freezeouts."" Cue his standard line, ""What effort are you making in this relationship? Why am I the only one who's doing anything here? Why should I continue to do this work when you are being so selfish?"" 

The stoppage of yelling was homework from the very first session. He did that. But subsequent sessions' homework has been things like, ""Go on a date this week"" and ""Make one show of affection as soon as you're home from work"" and ""Make time for conversation before bedtime"" etc. -- all of which have been spectacular failures. On our ""date"" he refused to so much as hold my hand and spent all his time wandering off on his own (we were at a museum) - and when I brought it up later he got massively pissed saying ""WE WENT ON A DATE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT"".  The  show of affection - well, he used to do it if he came home later than me, but if I come home from work later than him, he is always distracted and does not reciprocate my hug *even after I point it out*, and now since he started stonewalling me for days after each counseling session, I haven't even tried to do this homework because fuck it, who wants to hug a stonewaller (same goes for conversation before bedtime). 

This shit has really woken me up, y'all. I don't know what sort of fantasy I had constructed out of whole cloth that made me love this guy. He really doesn't want to lift a finger. He seems to lose it completely at the thought of my leaving - cries, seems desperate - but it translates into ZERO action. He really doesn't care about me at all. 

Anyway - I said as much to him early this week and told him I am leaving. Next week I have an appointment with an attorney to see what my options are. This shit is really happening. I am leaving. I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried but I have never been more sure of anything.

I ended up getting sick during my flight back so my big plans kind of collapsed and we just stayed in Friday night. She was taking care of me so sweetly, and when we were lying in bed together I felt so happy I just had to tell her. She said for her this is really serious thing and she needs some time, but wasn't weirded out or feeling pressured or anything, and instead was happy. I was perfectly fine with that and mentally accepted that 'OK, if things keep going well I can wait however many more weeks or months it takes her to feel comfortable saying it.' 


We spent a romantic weekend mostly just cuddlin' and fuckin' and taking nice walks. Monday morning when she was getting on the bus to work and we were parting ways she said 'Goodbye, I love you' so matter of factly and out of nowhere my heart almost exploded.

Thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Even though I was seriously pissed off (as I'm sure you could tell), I carefully read each comment and thought about it. Thank you all for your advice. 

Out of the three main options--talk to my parents, confront my sister, or have my boyfriend shut her down--I decided to take two. I contacted my parents first, which was very difficult for me, and told them about what had been going on and that I was going to kick my sister out. I said it in a ""no arguments"" way, just a statement of fact that her behavior was completely unacceptable and that I had given her many chances in talking to her about it. I said I was telling them first so my kicking her out wouldn't come out of the blue for them and they could help her find someplace else to live if they wanted to. I did not send the screenshots of her FB convo because 1) I never took the screenshots and 2) I didn't feel any need to prove anything to them, it really felt like my decision whether they believed me or not. 

To my surprise, my parents actually believed my side of the story, though not for the reasons you would think. 

1) There had apparently been an ""incident"" at a recent family reunion that I didn't know about because I'd been unable to go. Our close cousin, Bea, who is one year older than me, brought her boyfriend to our annual family reunion to introduce him to everyone for the first time. Apparently Hannah shamelessly and openly flirted with Bea's BF in front of everybody--in front of Bea, in front of our parents, in front of Bea's parents, all of our aunts and uncles. I don't know *exactly* what Hannah did, but according to Bea (who I asked about it after) she was very obvious about it, trying to touch him a lot, sitting next to him whenever Bea got up to go somewhere else. Etc. It was just very obvious.

Everyone witnessed it and it was the gossip of the family for that entire day. My aunt and uncle (Bea's parents) were disgusted with her behavior and judged my parents for allowing Hannah to behave that way. ALL OF A SUDDEN my parents cared about what she was doing, because now it was affecting their reputation with the family (the most important thing to them). So apparently they were pissed at her for what had happened and had taken her car away for a few months prior to her coming to live here.  

2) My parents don't want anything to endanger my relationship with my boyfriend because they consider him to be a ""catch"" (white, handsome, going to law school) and want us to get married and have smart babies. :| So they don't want Hannah to ruin that.

My parents said they would talk to Hannah and beat it into her head that she could no longer act that way and that she was close to fucking up her living situation and our relationship. They begged me to give her a second chance and to give her time to change once they talked to her. I told them I'd think about it, but once we hung up I decided I didn't trust them to *actually* talk to her (call it 18 years of experience)... 

Well, whether they talked to her or didn't, the very next day Hannah posted something on her facebook to the tune of ""Sometimes you can't let other people get in the way of love! ;)"" So I sat her down and decided to have a talk with her myself. 

I told Hannah that if she didn't cut out her behavior immediately, I was going to kick her out. I told her that I knew about everything and that it sickened me that she would not only disrespect me by trying to seduce my boyfriend, but that she would freely backstab her own sister just to get with a guy. I told her that it made me feel disgusted knowing that she had a childish infatuation with my boyfriend, but that even if she did have feelings she couldn't help, she needed to learn how to control them like an adult and RESPECT ME, my relationship, and my home. 

Hannah mouthed off and said that my boyfriend was going to leave me anyway because I didn't put enough effort in looking good for him (I don't wear makeup every day, only on special occasions or on dates when I want to look nice for him, and my clothes are pretty plain) and that there were dozens of women in this city that could catch his eye. Then she said that she didn't have to listen to me, fuck you, you're not that much older than me, you're not my mom. She said, word for word, **""I'm not a kid anymore, I can do whatever the fuck I want.**""

Surprisingly I kept my cool and told her that was true, there were adult consequences to her actions, consequences which could range from getting kicked out and having to move back home to getting her ass beat. She was in the real world and couldn't get away with her shit anymore. 

She said ""I couldn't kick her out because it was illegal"" and that she could do whatever she wanted, and doing whatever she wanted meant ""being herself"" around my boyfriend. So I told her that she had 30 days to evict the apartment. 

She stormed off. I contacted the landlord and made sure that everything was square (she's not on the lease so they didn't give a shit) and told my parents that it was final, my sister had to be out of the apartment by the end of the month. They didn't say much and seemed stunned that she would ""suddenly"" act this way. They think the influence of the big city is causing her to act out... Whatever. 

I chose not to involve my boyfriend further because several people said that this was between us (me and Hannah), and they're right. I don't want him unnecessarily uncomfortable/forced to do something he doesn't want to do, though he has voluntarily offered to talk to Hannah and shut her down in the past. I personally don't think it would do much to stop her anyway, given her reaction to my little lecture. So I left him out of it. 

I am getting a small nannycam to monitor the apartment while I'm away however, to make sure 1) Hannah doesn't break anything and 2) to protect myself and my boyfriend in case she decides to make any false accusations against either one of us. At this point, I wouldn't put it past her. I seriously have to wonder if my sister is just a huge fucking bitch as a result to being hopelessly spoiled, or if there is something going on with her. I really don't know, but I'm fed up with her acting this way when *I* did her a favor in letting her live with me. 

So, that's that. Hopefully I don't have to update again and she moves out peacefully... Thanks all for listening to me rant. 

**tl;dr: I called my parents, they believed me about Hannah due to some past behavior but begged me to give her another chance. I talked to her, she blatantly told me to fuck off. I'm not giving her a second chance. She has 30 days to move out and I'm getting a nannycam to protect myself, my belongings, and my boyfriend. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with her honestly.** 

**EDIT: So far I haven't heard from Hannah herself because I've been at my boyfriend's pad, but my parents tell me that she will be out of the apartment by the end of the week. Her facebook is a whiny crying shitstorm of ""LIFE IS NOT FAIR"" ""NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME"" ""YOU CAN'T FUCKING TRUST ANYBODY, NOT EVEN FAMILY"" and ""MY LIFE IS RUINED"". I have hidden her from my feed and I am going to watch anime with my boyfriend. I have already served her formal eviction papers as of today; thank you all for your suggestions. 

Also: some people seem very upset that I alluded to my parents thinking my boyfriend is a catch because he is white. To the point where I'm getting very redundant PMs about it. Let me be clear: I am not white, I am Asian. However, I do not hold my Asian parents' viewpoint. My boyfriend's race does not matter to me; I think he's a catch, not for those reasons, and I love him for who he is. My parents are old-school racist Asian people who objectify people (including their children) and reduce them to basic, simple attributes that are categorized into ""approved"" and ""disapproved"". A strong handsome white dude happens to fall into their category of ""yay."" They also think I'll never do any better than him, so all in all it's a pretty fucked up way of thinking for both sides. You can see why I don't talk to them much. 

I never condoned this attitude and I'm fully aware of how racist it is, but there's nothing I can do about how they--and a large aspect of the culture they come from--view the world. I'm quite tired of people getting worked up about that one comment and thinking that *I* subscribe to that line of thinking. I do not.

I just want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post. This issue is such a non-issue that I can't believe how seriously you all took me. All the tips, caution, the encouragement just reminded me how wonderful everyone here can be.


Thanks to you guys and the post I made, I was reminded of all the wonderful qualities and reasons I fell in love with my boyfriend and I decided to send him some pictures. It took awhile to find one I felt comfortable with, but I did find one! I know some people think I shouldn't, but I did include my face in it because I feel like it helped show how much I trust Ben and how much I love him.


I waited until the late evening when he told me how he was getting ready for head off to bed when I messaged him with a picture and then sent ""More surprises when you get back ;)"" and I'll admit, I got a little panicky. After a few minutes, Ben sent a message back with ""Oooh very sexy! <3"" and pretty much that was that (Outside of our usual goodnights and I love yous).


I'll admit it, reddit, I didn't know how to take his message back on account of having never sent a photo like this before. Was he being nice? Was this a typical response which was good? Should he have said more? Should I have said more? I didn't know how to feel other than a little disappointed, especially with how long it took me to take the photo. Alongside this, Ben sent me a message the next day telling me about how busy he'll be and then never responded back. I got upset and started feeling like I made a mistake. I spent my day off work with a mix of disappointment, regret and panic, a panic that I had made a huge mistake.


Well, that afternoon I got a knock at my door and who was there? Ben. That's who was at my door. Ben and a bunch of flowers. I wasn't expecting him for a few more days and before I could say anything he told me about how he pulled a favor with his boss (whom he's friendly with) and because the team had pretty much finished up their project he got the go ahead to head home early. Ben told me that he saw the picture and was speechless for a few minutes because he had never expected anything like that from me but knew he had to get home right away to see me. And then he said he felt like the luckiest man in the world.


We've spent every day together since and we've had a fabulous time and I've never felt better about my relationship and about myself. Ben has already asked if he'll get another picture anytime soon. I told him ""Only if you're good"" :)

After hanging out with Annie for four hours this weekend, I mustered up the courage to tell her about Finnick's Tinder profile. I told her that I didn't want her to think I was implying anything, but that if it were me, I would want to know, and I thought she would want to know, too.

She already knew. Not because they're in an open relationship, but because he had been having a three month texting ""affair"" with a girl last year. After that girl found out about Annie, she wrote Finnick a letter about how brokenhearted she was, then Finnick 'fessed up to Annie.

Annie said she doesn't really considering it cheating, and that's fine, because it's her relationship and so she and Finnick get to determine the dealbreakers.

I think she was a little concerned, though, because apparently he told her that he had deactivated/deleted his account, and that clearly didn't happen. She texted him when we were together and told him that someone else had found his profile. He apologized and swore that he didn't have the app downloaded but that he would go ahead and make sure his account is deactivated.

I don't know how many people were really looking for an update, but I did get helpful advice on my last post and I really appreciated everyone's input.

3 months later and we have decided to end our relationship. We officially broke up a few weeks ago, and he moved his furniture out of our apartment this week.

I received incredibly varied advice from my original post. I took all of it into consideration, and let him read the post as well.

We tried our very best over the last few months to move past this, but we were not able to. Breaking up seemed like the only option left.

To all of you that told me that he wanted to be with me, but didn't want to get married, you were right. I didn't want to believe it, but after months of circular conversations, it came back every time. He just didn't want to get married, he didn't feel like he was ready, and he didn't know when he would be.

Basically I wanted to post an update on this thread because I needed to get it off my chest. I always figured that maybe some of you were in similar situations and you were hoping to eventually hear the outcome.

Thank you to everyone who had originally commented on my post! You definitely gave me a lot to think about.

My original post didn't get much attention, but a lot has happened since I made that last post so I figured I'd update. I took the advice of reaching out to her again and I invited her to the movies again (I go there a lot lol). We met up at the theater and we talked about our previous date.

Me: ""So... sorry about not talking to you for a few days.""

Her: ""It's cool.""

Me: ""Yeah... I was just kind of caught off guard by the kiss. Not that I disliked it, uh, I was just kind of surprised and I wasn't expecting it because I've never been kissed before. I mean, uh, I've been kissed by like my grandma and stuff-""

At this point in my awkward ramble, she starts laughing. ""You are so funny.""

We stood there in silence for a second. I decided to break the silence.

""You know, it wasn't a *bad* kiss. I was just kinda caught off guard. I mean, I don't really have the authority to judge kisses, considering I've only had the one-""

And she cut me off and kissed me. Except this time, it was reciprocated. We stopped kissing and she looked at me and said, ""Two.""

So yeah, I guess I have a girlfriend now.

322,c0mplicatednights,? Locked Post ?,3k5o1s,2712,"Hi Reddit. I apologize for a wall of text, but I feel like I need to write everything out to vent my frustrations. So, here we go!

So last Saturday, my boyfriend whom I've been dating for 5 years had a threesome.. We're very protective of each other, and we've had our fair shares of having someone chasing us or trying to get at us, but we've always remained committed. We always tell each other everything, and yes, we do get jealous a lot. A couple months ago, we watched porn together and stumbled upon a threesome video (M/F/F), and we thought it was pretty hot. A couple days later, he asked me if I wanted to add some spice to our sex life, and I said yes because I wasn't aware of what he had to purpose. He asked to have a threesome and mentioned we could hit up a bar and pick up a girl. At first I didn't feel comfortable having my man to share with someone else especially in bed. The thoughts of him fucking another girl just made me feel..exhausted and frustrated. But he kept begging me for months, and I reluctantly said yes. But we decided to come up with rules, and we were both to follow it up and promised it's the first and last time having a threesome. 

So here are the rules we (mainly me) came up with: No kissing, both women have to have equal attention, no anal, and she can't stay after. He agreed and we watched some more threesome porn to give us ideas. Then last weekend came and he decided it was finally time to get it done, so we hit up a bar and talked to some girls. Well, we didn't straight up ask them to involve in a threesome. Then I noticed my boyfriend disappeared for a good 15 minutes or so, and when he came back, he asked me to wait in the car because he got someone. I was very nervous, and he brought her along to the car. We did the introductions right away, and I noticed that she was very plump. Although my size and proportions are among the average, she was obviously much plumper, bigger, and thicker.. On the way back home, my boyfriend was very bubbly and excited.

We decided to check in at a motel that was close to the bar as in ""no strings attached"" type. Once we got our room, we decided to wash up first and stuff. Then my boyfriend approached me first and started making out with me which was very hot. I forgot that ""Anna"" was there and out of nowhere, she grabbed my boyfriend away and put his face between her breasts and started undressing him. I was shocked. Shocked that she made a sudden move like that and shocked to see him sucking her breasts while she was undressing him. I started feeling uncomfortable right away. The next thing I knew, they undressed each other, and she was going down on him. I had to undress myself (I still can't fucking believe it either), and I joined her to blow him. Then he ate us out, and I noticed that he was very into her large breasts, constantly rubbing the tits or squeezing it. Then let's just say that he was fucking her most of the time, and I was just next to them force-masturbating the whole fucking time. He did do a few strokes with me, but he quickly scrambled back to her. Then she started riding him while he was nibbling and sucking her breasts and at one point, I pulled out his penis out of her to give a signal that it was my turn, but he BATTED my fucking hands away and continued with their fucking. And of fucking course, she moans like a fucking whale. I just can't stand it anymore. I felt fucking embarrassed and disgusted by watching them mainly fuck while I had to sit out and force-masturbate myself. Like this wasn't our fucking deal. So I just quickly put on my night dress and left. I don't even think they noticed me leaving...

Then I left and I peeked through the windows (our room was on the ground floor) and the curtains were kinda swept sideways and sure enough, they were fucking kissing and she was riding him. I felt so fucking disgusted and betrayed. I ended up sitting in the car for an hour and went back to the room and found them sleeping naked. He had his hands over her breast and shit, and I didn't want to slide into the bed. And I fucking ended up sleeping in the car (yes fun) and headed back into the room in the morning and found her blowing him. I yelled at her and told her to get the fuck out of the room and she crossed the line. She got pissed and left, and HE GOT PISSED AT ME FOR RUINING 'THE MOMENT.' We ended up fighting big time, and I told him that he was fucking her most of the time and crossed the lines and broken our promises. He was just hysterically yelling and told me things like that can happen during threesome. I just grabbed my keys and left and haven't talked to him since then. He called and texted many times, but I felt disgusted and fucking betrayed. At this point, I don't want to continue this relationship with him or even talk it out with him. Should I just break it off without meeting him or just break it off after talking it out with him?

   
**tl;dr**: Had threesome with my boyfriend and he just fucked another girl for most of the time and broke our promises. Should I talk with him beforehand and talk it out or should I just break it off without meeting him?

**EDIT:** He just stopped by my apartment and banged on the door asking me to speak to him. He sounded like he's been crying. I think he fucking finally just realized that he fucked up.

**EDIT 2:** We did lay out our rules and restrictions before sex. We didn't jump into it right away without letting her know what's allowed and what's not.

**EDIT 3:** I don't know if they fucked again throughout the night without me since I slept in the car. But I wouldn't be fucking surprised if they did either",1441753960.0,I [23 F] had threesome with my boyfriend [24 M] and a girl [23 F] and I feel betrayed,0.87
323,Throwawayex232,Breakups,75dp8z,2702,"Hi Reddit. It would be nice if I could get some advice and see if my actions were justified. 

My bf and I were in a long distance relationship. A few months ago, he started ignoring me and became distant, and his reason was because he was busy. I later found out that he's been talking to one of his ex and when I confronted him about this, he denied it and made me feel guilty. He then refused to talk to me and blocked me, without giving me any closure whatsoever.

After a few months of no contact, he added me again and even though I was still hurt by his actions, I eventually got back together with him on a condition that we wouldn't talk to any of our exes but now we're back right from the beginning. He's added her back on facebook and I feel so betrayed after he promised me that he would cut her off. At first I was okay with him talking with his exes but after he ignored me for them, that's when I became uncomfortable with him talking to them so we drew the line that we wouldn't add or talk to any of our exes.

Anyways, after I found out, I ended up typing a farewell message and just blocked him everywhere. I wanted to discuss it with him first but I feel like he's just going to lie to me again and I'd end up just taking him back again. Right now I'm just so hurt and I'm also scared that he might just ghost me again and I feel like that'd hurt me even more so I had to take the first step.

Anyways, my friends told me that I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him and talk it over or should I just continue to block him?

TLDR: Few months ago, BF ignored me before to talk to his exes. Confronted him about it and ended up ghosting me. He came back to me after a few months and promised he wouldn't talk to them or add them again but he just recently added them again and after I found out, I sent him a goodbye message with an explanation and blocked him. My friends are telling me I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him first or continue to block him?

I decided about three weeks ago that I would ask her to marry me, regardless of the future implications. Later that day, her dad called me and let me know she had slipped into a coma and was not responsive. She died the following day. She went very peacefully. 

I just wanted to say thank you all for the kind messages in my earlier post. She was also a student at my school, so I have the blessing to be able to mourn with my community. It will be a long road of grieving, but I promised her I would be okay.
   
**tl;dr**: She passed away, but I WILL be ok!

EDIT: I've gotten a few nasty messages about karma whoring, and that this is fake. I would be happy to verify with a mod, but i'd rather not put her information out in public out of respect for her family.

This got more attention than I thought it would, so I figured i'd give a little more info. The day I went to visit her, she wasn't exactly in a coma, but she was barely responsive. She smiled an made a little happy noise when her mom told her I had come to see her. She was 5'4"" and 75lbs that day. She had a tube coming out each nostril and four coming from various organs in her abdomen, and she was in a lot of pain. I sat by her side and told her how much I loved her and promised her that I would be ok. I told her how I will live the rest of my life with her in my mind. I cried and cried, but rejoiced in the idea that she would soon not be in pain. 

She gave me the confidence to be who I am today. Even through it all of this she taught me to choose happiness. 
The hardest part of it is just accepting it's over. I am so used to taking care of her every spare minute I had. I see a funny vine or picture And I want to send it to her so so bad. 

Her burial was absolutely beautiful. It was just her parents, her sister, and I. It was open casket, so I got to see her face one last time. It really was the closure I needed. There were no tubes coming out of her, the jaundice had faded, and there was not a trace of pain that she wore on her face for so long. A few days later she had her memorial service, which was incredible. There was around 1,200 people that signed the guest book. She was loved! 

Since then, it has been a few weeks since and I am doing pretty well. I feel that I am kind of denying things until I graduate, and then I will have time to grieve. For now, I am surrounding  myself with loved ones and staying busy. Thank you all for the kind words!

He of course agreed and asked me on a date afterwards - I'm taken so I obviously said no, but I did show the footage to my friend who dumped his girlfriend.

My friend was devastated, of course. He had been dating Candice for 8 years. But he said ""I knew you weren't lying, I just couldn't accept it"". He also apologized deeply for bringing up my sexuality and after a long talk, I decided to forgive him because I understand that he was in a bad place. He dumped his gf.

Hello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!


I have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. 


Throughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.


Things where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. 


However, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqu?, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.


The next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.


At the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.


When he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. 


I asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. 


So though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. 


This has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. 


Despite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. 


Do you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!


Do you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? 


Alas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.

After reading all of your comments it became clear to me I needed to tell him. He called me just to chat this evening, and told me all about his trip but how excited he is to see me again. As we were talking, I realized I really like this guy and suddenly I felt this weight falling onto my shoulders. I had to tell him.

So I told him about 30 minutes ago over the phone. First he laughed, and thought I was joking about being pregnant. Once he realized I was serious, he got quiet, but kindly asked me to just run him through the logistics of what was going to happen and what it was going to do to me.

He was genuinely concerned for me and my wellbeing, and kept saying how thankful he was that I told him. He said he'd be there for me through the whole process, and that I don't need to worry about it changing anything between us. He was rather impressed by my matter-of-fact and practical approach to the matter- and that I had the appointment and funds covered without even talking to him.

I honestly think this just showed me that he is a really good guy and wants what is best for me. He seemed to appreciate my maturity and mostly appreciated me telling him.

Thanks so much to everyone who encouraged me to do this. It was 100% the right decision, and I feel even more sure about a possible relationship/future together!

Link to the original-https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rihvk/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_serenaded_his_coworker/


After everything I was really pissed all of last week and was sort of planning on breaking up with him but I was taking my time making the decision because, well, break ups suck and it wasn't something I was looking forward to. I mentioned in the comments of my last post that I own a house that has been sitting vacant since I moved in with my boyfriend and it doesn't have a kitchen right now because I moved out in the middle of renovating it. I have a friend that owns a kitchen company so I asked him to come out to the house to look at it and draw up plans. He told me he would do it at cost without charging for labor and ever since I told my boyfriend that he's like ""what, are you fucking him? But how many blow jobs is it costing you?"" I work for the FD so obviously I work with a lot of (good looking) guys and he's just been so jealous lately, especially last week, trying to tell me who I can and can't talk to while at work. So, all that to say, it was definitely time for us to break up anyways. I just can't believe that he is giving me such a hard time but thinks him serenading this girl right in front of me was ok. 


I did look at a text he got that makes me think they were hooking up. I spent Thursday night out at a hotel with friends for a birthday and came home in the morning. He had a text on his phone that said something like ""omg noooo I was sleeping"" so I read through their conversation (which was conveniently deleted except for two messages) and he had texted her at 3am to see if she was awake. Maybe I'm reaching, but every time a guy has texted me that late it's been to hook up. That sealed the deal for me so I just left, it wasn't even worth fighting over because for a whole week now I've been pretty much done with him anyways. He didn't take it that well, which was surprising because it sure seemed like he wanted to break up, but whatever, it's done now.

Hi everyone. 

First of all, as I said in my edit on my original post I want to thank everyone who offered advice and support. I was amazed at the huge response I got, and while I couldn't reply to every comment I did read all of them. 

After R texted me, I replied to him asking if he had known my BF to behave like this with other girls in the past. 

Over the course of many texts it came out that he often yelled at and belittled his previous girlfriend in front of others, and some of his friends and family had suspicions about how far he was taking it. 

After the break up, the girlfriend posted some stuff on Facebook about how BF had hit her, said awful things to her and did other things like spying on her and deleting people from her phone behind her back. 

Initially when this happened R and his parents questioned BF, but he insisted that the physical abuse accusations where not true and that his EX was saying those things to cover up the fact that she had allegedly cheated on him. BF admitted to yelling at her but he told his family that she did the same and just as often. 

His family eventually accepted that, but R and his parents were always wary of BFs behaviour and R in particular had made a point to keep an eye on things. 

BFs ex apparently had also called R around 6 months after myself and BF had gotten together and asked him to help me if anything happened. At the time R was not quite ready to believe BF would physically abused anyone, but he told her all the same that he would watch out for me or any other girl in the future. 

R told me that after the way he saw BF behave at my party he became more convinced that BF was likely to get physical and that was why he chose to step in. He also told me that even if it didn't go that far, I should not put up with how BF treated me. 


I agreed, what R had told me, and all the information and support I recieved here had me pretty convinced that I was not in a good situation. I decided to go and stay with R and his roommates for a short time. 

I don't have too many other options for accomodation this urgently. My parents live too far away and the few friends I could stay with are other girls with enough on their plate, and I didn't want to risk bringing this drama to their doorsteps. In retrospect I'm glad I chose to go to R's, because I feel like what followed could have been even more frightening and dangerous if only myself and another girl had been present. 

I didn't have much time to get my stuff together before BF was due to arrive home, so I packed a few bags of essentials and valuables, along with my school things, and R picked me up. 

I left a note at the house for BF I was leaving and that I did not plan on returning, other than to retrieve the rest of my things. I didn't tell him where I would be staying and that I would rather he didn't contact me directly, suggesting he communicate through his mother instead. 


I got to R's and got settled in, while choosing to leave was difficult and I had a few bouts of crying, I also felt immensely relieved. 

R/BFs parents came around and brought some dinner. They were incredibly nice about everything and told me I had to do what was best for me. We always got along well but I never expected them to be so kind and supportive given the situation.

Half way through dinner, my phone rang. It was BF. I did not want to answer it and everyone else agreed that was probably a good idea. After my phone rang out, R/BFs Mum's phone began to ring. Predictably enough it was BF calling. His dad answered the phone, the phone was not on speaker but BF was loud enough that you could hear him yelling down the phone. 

I couldn't tell exactly what was said, but his dad was telling him to calm down, and not to do something. BF hung up on him, and R/BF's dad told us BF was coming to R's place, and saying this was all R's fault. 

R started to get a bunch of text messages from BF making threats and telling R that he knew I was there and ha was coming to get me. R replied to him saying that if BF came here and caused trouble he would be calling the police, but BF ignored him. 


BF showed up at R's probably 15 minutes later. He drove up the lawn and almost hit the letterbox, and got out of his car and started yelling. R and his dad went out while I stayed in the front room with his Mum. BF yelled for a while and was kicking at random parts of the garden. 

BF started to yell towards the house that he knew I was there and to come out. I wasn't planning on coming out at all and R told him to leave. 

BF ended up running around the side of the house to the back patio entry, the screen door was locked but the solid back door wasn't, and he started hitting the fly wire trying to break it. He kept yelling into the house that he knew I was there and that if I didn't come out, he would destroy all my stuff and log on to my school accounts and cause problems on there. 

R and his dad caught up to BF and started pulling him away from the door, BF started throwing punches and his Mum and I both went out to the inside of the back door, because we were worried someone would get hurt. 

BF saw me and started trying for the back door again, and saying if I didn't get in the car he would kill himself. His mum said she was going to call the police. 

BF/R's dad ended up hauling him out to the front yard and told him to leave. 

BF did eventually get into the car, he spun his wheels and tore up the grass and drove off. 

I felt pretty awful after all that. His mum and dad were both visibly really upset and R's rental property had been messed up and I felt responsible, they were still so nice about everything though. They really are wonderful people. 

I spoke to the police and they said they would be speaking to BF about what happened and I got some advice about obtaining a VRO and making sure I could find away of retrieving my stuff from the house, so that is all ok for the moment. 

The latest news is that BF has been all over Facebook saying that R and I had been having an affair and posting all these random cropped blurry porn pictures from the Internet saying it was us, and that he had caught us in the act. None of us are responding to any of it at this point, haven't really decided what to do there. 


My plan is to stay with R for now. It's still my best option and R has said he won't leave me alone at the house in case BF comes back. Either he or his male roomate would be there, we also spoke to a couple of the neighbours that R is friendly with and they said they would keep an eye out for his car or call us if they saw anything dodgy. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do next. I'm planning to talk to my uni about getting in to student housing, I'm planning to go out tomorrow to buy some pepper spray also. I'm tossing up about reaching out to BFs ex, but I'm not sure if that will cause more problems for everyone. 


So I suppose that's it, for now at least? I'm sorry that this was a bit of a novel- but I know a lot of people wanted an update and considering how nice everyone has been I wouldn't want anyone to worry that I had gone back/stayed with him. Rest assured that is totally out of the question, the more I think about things that happened within our relationship with this new perspective, the more I realise how fucked up some of those things were. 


Again a huge thank you to everyone, I'll do my best to keep up with the comments and respond to any PMs

After reading people's reactions I realised perhaps I'd been a little blinded by infatuation. I sent her a message taking the blame upon myself for being over possessive (I took the blame to avoid confrontation, I just wanted it to end quickly) and the conversation went as follows.


Me: [long apology / we need to break up message]

Her: ""so we're done?""

Me: ""It's probably for the best.""

Her:""okay""


We haven't spoken a word since about four days ago when that happened, and I now realise just how little she cared about me. I'm off to university in a week, and couldn't be feeling better about myself!

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3smtqa/my_gf_30f_overheard_my_35m_family_talking_badly/) found here. 

A few people have messages me for an update, so I thought would post. First, thank you for all the kind words and great ideas. It really helped me get some perspective on the situation.

First off, Sammy and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We spent  it out of town in a small skiing town. It was a great weekend and we spent a lot of time talking and discussing what to do about my family. Sammy was still pretty hurt over the matter but was adamant that I shouldn't cut all ties with my family.  I told her that all depended on my family.

My mom was in denial that I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving. After my last post, I let her know Sammy and I wouldn't be attending. She brushed it off until the day before Thanksgiving when she called to make sure I was bringing pie. I reminded her I wouldn't be at dinner and she broke down crying. She told me she was sorry for hurting Sammy and would like the chance to apologize. I let her know she'd have a chance after Thanksgiving. 

After we got back from our Thanksgiving trip, my parents came over for dinner. I had okay'd this with Sammy. She thought my parents deserved a chance to make this right and frankly, I think she really wanted to mend things with my family. Dinner was, awkward, to say the least. My dad started out by offering Sammy a genuine apology. He told her he was extremely embarrassed and genuinely wanted to make things up to her. They had a nice chat. The talk with my mom, well, that went okay. My mom cried through most of it and tried to reinforce that she was very sorry. I couldn't tell if she was sorry or just upset that I was taking Sammy's side. I don't think Sammy was convinced either.

A few days after dinner, my mom called Sammy and asked her to lunch to talk by themselves. Several comments in my last post mentioned that my family probably felt Sammy was annoying simply because they felt intimidated  or projecting their own issues on her. I think that was spot on. Sammy went to lunch with my mom they had a very long, good talk about everything. She said my mom felt jealous that Sammy was so educated and had the chance to get an education. And Sammy admitted to being jealous that my mom has a big family. Sammy opened up to my mom about the situation with her own family and living on her own since she was a teenager. I think that hit my mom very hard because she's always been surrounded by a big, loving family. And, I think she was horrified by her own behavior towards Sammy, who wanted to be a part of the family. Overall, I think things are better between my parents and Sammy. 

My younger sister reached out to Sammy after Thanksgiving. I don't think any of my siblings expected me to ditch family dinner and I heard they were pretty upset I went on vacation instead. My sister apologized over the phone. I don't know if it was enough, but it was a good step. Sammy says she's feeling pretty neutral about my youngest sister. She said she feels like my sister is more sorry she was caught, but Sammy appreciated the apology.

My brother had to endure a very uncomfortable few weeks at work, while Sammy was traveling. I think by Thanksgiving, he was confident that Sammy wasn't going to screw with his job. When Sammy got back to work after our vacation, he went to her office to apologize. Again, I think he apologized just to appease us. But, he did it in person and didn't try to cop out. Like my sister, Sammy feels neutral about him.

My other sister (my brother's twin) is the only hold out. She hasn't given Sammy an apology and seems pissed that she no longer has a built in free babysitter. She's doubled down and said she has nothing to apologize for and Sammy is the one causing troubles. This has caused a bit of a rift in my family. My parents would like Sammy and I to come to Christmas dinner, but I'm not interested in being around my sister right now and I'm not going to subject Sammy to that. My parents have even suggested that my sister should stay home to make us more comfortable in coming. While I appreciate the sentiment, I would feel guilty about my sister being alone on Christmas (her kids will be with their dad). Sammy and I have plenty of offers from friends, my sister would probably not be able to find a place to go on short notice. Sammy has told my parents she would rather not create a bigger rift and we'll come over at another time. Sammy told me, privately, that while she has forgiven my family, she's not all the comfortable hanging out with my family just yet. I'm perfectly okay with this, I feel like taking some time from my family will be a good thing. Sammy and I are still deciding where to go on Christmas, probably to my best friend's house.

The best part of the update: My best friend's wife went ring shopping with me. She let me go to all the chain stores and balked at the prices for the same ring in every store. She eventually took me to a local jeweler and we discussed a custom ring. The jeweler completely understood what I wanted and I decided she would be great at designing a ring. She's pretty backed up with orders, and said she'd be able to get to it in January. A few nights ago, she texted me a picture of a stone she had found, to see if it fit what I had in mind. Sammy saw the text and it led to an impromptu proposal. She said yes! So, now I have a fiance! We haven't really told anyone yet. I'll tell my family at some point. But for now, I'm enjoying sharing this time with her. 

So, things are okay. Better than I hoped since my last post. I'm very sad about my sister because I miss her and her kids. And I miss my family. But, I feel good about my decisions. I feel like things will get better with my family, except my sister, in time. Sammy liked the idea of a destination wedding next summer, but we haven't even started any planning yet. Sammy told me after everything that's happened with my family, she feels confident that I have her back and that she finally has me as her true family.

TL;DR Parents, brother and sister apologized and tried to make things right. Other sister is holding fast in her assholishness. Proposed and now I have a fiance. ",1450937965.0,UPDATE: My GF [30F] overheard my [35M] family talking badly about her,0.98

**tl;dr original**: My long distance gf accidentally copied and pasted a nude photo of herself into my Facebook chat. She apologized and said it was meant for me later as a surprise, but we have never exchanged photos and I don't believe her. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Thanks to everyone for their replies. It really helped put things into perspective: for example, it is way more common to take self timer nudes than I thought, and that it's possible to check the metadata for a photo and find out some details like whether or not it was taken on a self timer. 


I want to especially thank /u/justtotalkaboutrelat for asking me if Christina and I had actually dated for a full year yet, or if we had an anniversary coming up. Because, as it turns out, we did (I don't know why I didn't make the connection on my own)! And, as it turns out, **my girlfriend is not cheating on me!**


A couple days ago I got a big package in the mail to celebrate our one year anniversary. Among other things, it contained an envelope filled with multiple nude photos of my wonderfully awesome girlfriend, with a note saying ""I know you never asked, but I wanted to give you something special since I can't be there with you!"" Among the photos was the one that she accidentally sent to me. She also included a USB with the photos uploaded, along with the physical copies, so that I could have digital versions.


Here are a few extra details to better explain what happened:


* Christina did indeed take the photo's herself. I asked her (nicely) how she managed to do a self timer at such a good angle, because my initial reaction to the photos were that somebody else obviously must have taken them. She showed me through Facetime how she was able to prop her phone up against some objects in her room, and they were exactly from the angle she sent them at!


* To further corroborate this story, Christina had actually confirmed my address with one of our mutual friends a few days before the accidental-copy-and-paste situation went down. So she had in mind that she wanted to send this package *before*, not as a cover-up for accidentally giving herself away


* When I asked her how she accidentally managed to send that particular nude, she said that she was copying and pasting the files from one folder to the USB she sent me. She forgot that the nude was still on her clipboard. When she tried to send me that gif, it didn't copy properly, and instead she pasted what was on her clipboard previously. She said she was just relieved that it was me she made this mistake on, and not somebody else!


* Finally, I took the advice that many of you commented/messaged me. I checked the data on the image files and they were indeed taken recently on a self timer. 


So, sigh of relief! Thank you to everyone here for putting my mind at ease. I was convinced that everyone was going to say I was definitely being cheated on. But honestly, Christina has never done anything to even make me suspect that she would be cheating! I am very happy.

333,idkwhattodo449,Relationships,51gpbb,2654,"Been with Stephanie (name changed for privacy) for a little over 3 years. More or less relationship is good, she tends to be way overdramatic when we fight (which isn't often) but I can usually talk her down and things work out. 

When Stephanie and I first started dating she mentioned a few times in kind of a mysterious (I thought it was attention-seeking, still do) way that she had some kind of mental illness or mental health struggle. Eventually (probably two or three months in) she came out and told me in a really serious conversation that she has body dysmorphia and thinks she's obese and hates herself for it. 

Now let me be clear, I love her the way she is, wouldn't change a thing, I don't mind her weight whatsoever. But even when she said it initially, I almost thought it was a joke. Stephanie is obese. I'm not good at guessing weight and she's never told me her weight, but I know she's 5'4 and a size 22 in pants (US). She's by all standards obese. I don't mind it at all. I'm attracted to her, I think she's beautiful, I would never ask her to change a thing.

It didn't come up again for a while but last fall she took a psychology course for her college degree and they talked about mental illness and it came back up. She came in one night almost happy? in a weird way, saying that she understands everything that's wrong with her because they talked about BD in class and it all makes sense. She has never been diagnosed by a medical professional and can't see a doctor for lack of health insurance. 

Ever since then, she talks about it a lot. I'm not one to poke at people just to poke, so I just let it be. But she talks about it all the time. She blames arguments we have on her BD. She uses it as an excuse to eat poorly and not take care of herself, because she is straight up convinced that she is smaller than she is and that the person she sees in the mirror is a dysmorphic situation. She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her ""struggle"" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her ""actual"" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen. No offense intended to my girlfriend, but that's not her body type. She is much bigger than that.

I'm getting to the point where I don't know what to do. She uses it as an excuse for all her behavior. I honestly don't know if she truly thinks she has BD or if she just uses it to justify herself. When we first moved in together, she would cover all the sizes on the tags of her clothes with Sharpie so I wouldn't see them. She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it.

I know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services. I'm not sure what to do.

Wow! I didn't expect my post to blow up like this, and thanks to whomever sent me the gold! Reading everyone's replies has helped me realize I made the right choice by leaving him. It's been an emotional rollercoaster, I've cried, laughed, felt scared, felt confused and angered. I know want to go in to counseling, which I'm planning on doing as soon as I'm able to do so. I've managed to block him on my phone, so I don't think I'll have to change my number after all. I called my apartment this morning to see if they could grab the router and cables from my place and hang on to it until they can be retrieved, they were happy to at least do that for me, so now he doesn't have internet! I did listen to a few voice mails he left for me in one message, he was calling me by my pet name, and literally talking in cutesy baby voice to me. The next voicemail he was just yelling at me. They've made me laugh but also make me well, afraid, of him. I've taken everyone's advice and I will be extremely careful for the next few months - I have pepper spray, I won't be traveling alone, and I'll be using campus or police escorts when possible.

So, things have happened rather rapidly since Tuesday. 

[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48k7nu/my_23f_so_30m_has_decided_he_doesnt_have_to_pay/)

I talked to my mom some more about what has been going on, I wasn't too open with my parents about how bad it was. She basically wanted to get me out ASAP after I revealed more to her. Anyway, so here is what has happened so far. 

* Apartment - it's in my name, the lease is up in May. I talked to my landlord about the situation a bit, basically they can't force him out because there's no official reported criminal activity. He has 30 days to leave. It would also be more expensive for me to break the lease than to pay out for the next two months. Which really sucks. March's rent has already been paid leaving April and May left. The penalty charge is 3 months rent and they can't do anything else. However, I did choose an option to put my apartment ""on market."" Which basically means they can start showing my apartment after Dipshit's 30 days are up, so he'll have no choice but to leave after that. If they happen to find someone to take the apartment before May 1, I don't have to pay that month's rent. They did copy all the documents and everything I signed and a note for him about getting out in 30 days. I left that in the apartment for him. Since his name wasn't on anything he didn't need to sign anything or be present. 

* Jobs - First job: I talked my manager, she was very understanding and was able to start a transfer to a different store near where my parents live. My parents live an hour away from the apartment, btw. I still have to show up to work in my old town a few more times until the transfer is (chance it may not be accpeted) accepted, but my manager and I were able to work out a light schedule. And there will be at least 3 other people in the store with me during those times I'm scheduled. Second job: I called my old professor who was also super understanding, we had a under the table cash only agreement, so it was easy to end that working relationship. It sucked, but she understood. 

* A lot of people mentioned that this was an abusive relationship. I did a lot of research on ""signs you're in an abusive relationship,"" and he checks off a lot of boxes. There were a lot of other red flags I didn't even mention in my last post about how horrible he is. This was a huge eye opener for me, and I realized the level of danger I was in by being near him. Unfortunately the revelation I've had has also caused me to feel incredibly depressed, even more so then I felt before. I'm trying not to blame myself for how horrible things have gotten, but it's really hard. I can't help but think that I shouldn't have gone this far in the relationship and that I've permanently damaged myself. But, that's a discussion for another sub. *sigh* 

* As I mentioned earlier my mom wanted me to GTFO of my apartment ASAP. I had to convince her not to drive down and take me away in that moment. Dipshit worked last night and would be out of the apartment after 5pm. My mom, dad and uncle arrived at the apartment at 5:30pm. I told my best friend what was happening (who lives close to me) and she came by the apartment as well. The 5 of us were able to pack up pretty much everything I own and put it in all of our cars. So I'm now home! 

* Loose ends -

1) I still have a few GRE classes to attend, but it's only once a week.

2) Hopefully the transfer will be approved for my old job, I'm still scheduled to work a few days for the next two weeks in my old town, but it's extremely light. And as I mentioned, multiple people will be in the store with me, I won't be alone at any point. 

3) Anything else I need to discuss with my landlord can be handled over the phone/email. I've signed the appropriate documents. I'll likely have to pay damages after the lease has officially ended.  

* Dipshit - He called me late last night after he got off work, and was obviously confused and angry. I refused to tell him where I was, which just pissed him off more. I told him that because he was financially abusing me, as well as emotionally abusing me and scarring me on a regular basis by yelling/punching things/throwing things that I couldn't take it anymore. That I deserved better, that he was a horrible person, that I didn't love him anymore, etc. Well, he stopped being angry and turned on the water works. He apologized profusely, he begged me to come back to him. He said he could change and that he was only acting out because he was depressed and I should give him another chance. He even claimed that he was ""just about to tell me that we're financially even now!"" What are the odds?? It was the most surreal conversation I've ever had in my life. I felt absolutely nothing for him, his tears didn't upset me, his anger didn't upset me, I was just cold and numb throughout the entire conversation. I felt like I was getting bored just talking to him and wanted the conversation to end asap so I could watch Netflix. I literally started to glaze over other things he was saying, he was going back and forth from being sad to angry, and I was just on the phone like ""uh huh, yeah, sure, no.."" Eventually he caught on that I stopped paying attention to him. He snapped at me and asked when I was going to stop this bullshit I was pulling. He started to rage about something, I interrupted him and said I didn't want to talk to him anymore, that he was horrible and owes me thousands of dollars, and I never want to se him again. And then I hung up on him just as he about to put on the water works again. He called and texted a lot, I haven't responded. He's been continuing to call me today as well. My next step is to get a new number. 

Thanks to everyone who commented in my previous post, or pm'ed me. I wasn't able to get back to everyone, but I did read everything. The next few months are going to rough, but at least I won't be with that asshole anymore. 

**tl;dr** Friends and family came to my rescue in an emergency move out last night when Dipshit was at work.

Well, I brought it up to her again that it made me uncomfortable.  She used her usual excuses ""i'm used to it"" ""it doesn't matter who it's from "" and all the other crap.  I took most advice and brought up the idea of a new ring.  Nope, not an option.  I maybe got a little more angry than I needed to after that, or stressed, I don't know.  Anyways, she began crying, a lot.  And then the apologizing.  And then the ""I'm sorry, I'm still in love with him"".

and then awesome fucking truth where she told me she has been sleeping with him the entirety of our relationship (she never stopped sleeping with him after they broke up).

People really suck sometimes. 

EDIT; I've seen this asked a few times - yes they are ACTUALLY broken up.  They used to live together and they no longer do.  They are never together in public.  He also has a new girlfriend.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42vdem/me_29f_with_my_vegan_coworker_29f_i_dont_know_how/

So the meeting happened on Friday. HR lady was a very much a ""let's all get along"" type and very enthusiastic and eager to mediate with buzzwords and talk about feelings.

HR contacted me and I told them to get Vegan's perspective first so that she wouldn't complain not getting a chance to get her point of view. 

So Vegan, boss and HR had a meeting. I'm pretty sure Vegan made it seem like she had been bullied which was pretty much what I was expecting.

Then the rest of us were called into a meeting with HR to give our points of view.

The coworker who was a cancer survivor had gotten progressively more annoyed at what happened after the meeting with Vegan taking off so I told her she was welcome to take the lead in the meeting because her issues could have had an actual health impact. 

She took up most of the time actually talking about how Vegan kept giving her unsolicited, medically unsubstantiated advice on cancer treatment and prevention and HR and boss started looking uncomfortable and concerned. A few other coworkers- like the one with coeliac especially also mentioned unsolicited advice.

The my Peruvian coworker brought up cultural insensitivity and the eating your pets comment and I didn't know Vegan said this to the Hindu coworker but apparently Vegan had told Hindu that veganism would make him a better Hindu because it eliminated all animal cruelty or something.

A few people started laughing at this and one coworker joked that Vegan was like the vegan Amway- always selling something that nobody was interested in.

So I'd been pretty quiet at that point and HR asked me, why I had asked Vegan to only speak about work related matters and I told her that I'm a hunter and briefly explained that I believe in ethical hunting and how it befitted endangered species etc. But Vegan kept on calling it murder, had a dig at me for my leather skirt even though other people here had leather shoes, leather handbag and HR injected that her Filofax was real leather and I told her the talking to Vegan was stressful and demoralizing and she'd refused to respect my boundaries when I asked her on other occasions to keep things work related.

So then the ""mediation"" begun and Vegan was brought in and other coworkers left. I basically said exactly what I'd said before to Vegan with HR and boss there, that I respected her lifestyle choice and how passionate she was about making a change but I disagreed with her on certain pointed and even if she didn't agree with my lifestyle choices, it was unfair of her to single me out or harass me about them.

Vegan said that to her, what I was doing was morally unconscionable and she didn't believe in exploiting animals.

I told her that her iPhone, her clothes, her computer were all produced via human exploitation and the quinoa that she loves so much has affected local income farmers in Bolivia but.. and then I qualified I told her it was great that she had her thing to try and improve the world but I also had a different perspective and different issues I was more passionate about and that I had respected her point of view and she should respect mine. 

Vegan's response to all of this was ""it's still murder"". HR looked annoyed at this point and said that Vegan was not trying to find a middle ground.

So I turned to HR and said that this was why there was no middle ground and that's why I thought keeping things civil and work related because in the end we are here to do a job.

HR agreed, boss agreed, I agreed, Vegan grudgingly agreed and HR wrote all this down and I had mediation meeting minutes saying all of this emailed to the 4 of us.

Anyway, boss called us into a meeting around lunch and said it was a good that we were able to talk about things outside of work because it's good team bonding but ""it had come to his attention"" that there was unsolicited health advice and cultural sensitivity issues in the team we'd be discussing that in our next team meeting and we'd had a productive session but needed to focus on work and keep our spirits up. 

Vegan had a meeting with boss after that and then went home early.

We had to come in on a Saturday and today end of month stuff (this happens when the end of month falls on a weekend- I'm in finance) but we get time in lieu.

I just gave Vegan a cheerful good morning to which she didn't respond and when she said handed me a file and said she was leaving, I just said thank you for your work today and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Vegan kind of just grunted at me and left.

I'm just going to keep it civil like HR said and Vegan and dig her own hole. I still feel a bit sorry for her, I still think she feels attacked but at least it got her off my back for the time being.

Anyway my daughter [17F] heard from one of her cousins that Stewart has asthma. I called my sister and I asked if this was true and she said it is the first time she is hearing of it. She went into his room and she found my sons inhalers. Her son still lives at home and is not doing anything with his life. No college, no job, nothing. 

You can tell they are my sons Asters because we have stickers on them. His little sister who is 7 put smiley faces on them because she believes it helps. My sister confronted him about it and he cam clean. He stole the inhaler and pretended to have asthma so people would not think he is out of shape. 

I know he has no job, but those things are not cheap and honestly I am furious. I think he should pay for what he used because really 2 of them are broken. My sister does not think she should pay for them if he can't and is asking me to cut him a break. 

I don't think I should, but I don't know what to do. This is really tearing a rift between myself and my sister. But at the same time it's like he stole my little boys inhalers, that to my is unforgivable.

My boy friend really wants me to go with him, but I don?t know if it?s the best thing for me, career wise. Currently, I?m in school, going for my bachelor?s degree. I only have two years left, and after that, I plan on getting into law school. He?s in the Air Force, stationed in Texas. Which he?s been here for about three years now. We have been together for 1 and a half. Knowing that he?s going ?overseas?, it?s possible he?ll be stationed in different countries for a few years. What?s holding me back is my career. Law school isn?t meant to be jumping around from country to country without knowing where you?ll land permanently due to the bar exam. Also, we aren?t married and I don?t know if I should risk my career (which I?ve been very committed to being a lawyer) for a future that?s a bit warped. I did see that I can become a programmer and it?ll be versatile, but that?s not what I truly want to do. Sure, Hawaii seems amazing, but more of a 3 year long vacation with a questionable future. We both agreed that long distance wouldn?t work since I would be all the way in Texas. Is it bad that I want to go but don?t want to risk it all just to be put in a bad situation of misery? Also, if I do go, I?d have to transfer schools, and go to school in Hawaii. That?s already a very high tuition, that has to be paid by fasfa and student loans. Quite frankly, I?m also afraid that I won?t be able to sustain myself, separately from my boy friend?s income. I like to feel independent, and know that I can fend for myself. Maybe that?s a pride issue? I don?t know, but I do know it?s a high standard of living. That also adds to the jumble of thoughts. I will also admit, I am fairly close to my parents. In my Hispanic household, we have always been very united. I currently work with them in their small business because it benefits the both of us. I can go to school with a flexible schedule and still make good income and they have a stable employee. That?s something my boy friend never really knew growing up. He?s a Kansas boy, from a small town, with parents who split up when he was little. I feel like he doesn?t understand how hard it?ll hit my parents and I, being far away for three years. It also bothers them a bit that I?m not married but willing to leave not knowing what?ll happen in the relationship. 

TL;DR: My boy friend is in the military and is being stationed in Hawaii. We have been together for one year and a half. We are currently In Texas. I want to go to law school, but moving around will be difficult. i?m trying to do what?s best for the both of us, what?ll benefit my career, how it?ll affect my parents and what?s the best choice since I?m not married, In the long run.

**TL/DR: Found pictures of LTR girlfriend cheating. Please help.**

Slight update: Once I felt like I could breathe again, I looked at the EXIF data from the pictures. They're from last month, taken by her phone. 

Update 2: Thank you, everyone. I still feel like I want to throw myself in front of a bus (less so than before), but I found somewhere to stay until I get back on my feet. If anyone has any suggestions about how to stop feeling like there is a weight slowly crushing my chest, I would really appreciate it. I have some packing to do, but I will try to respond to the thread when I can.

**Update 3**: I'm not vomiting or crying anymore, so I will consider that an improvement. Now I just feel empty. Like, somewhere between my belly button and my ribs is a space that used to be occupied and now is vacant. Time heals all wounds, I suppose. 

First, thank you all for responding to this thread. You have no idea how much it means to me to know that others, even if they are halfway around the world, care about this. Your collective advice and words of encouragement have helped me immensely. 

Second, to update the situation, my things are packed and in my car. I found someone to stay with temporarily, although I'm not sure for how long. I took the things that were sentimental to me or reminded me of her, drove them out of town, and burned and smashed it all. It was cathartic. I suppose littering the outdoors with my mementos isn't very eco-friendly, but I'm hoping Mother Nature will give me a pass on this one.  

Third, as per a number of requests in the thread, I changed her desktop background to one of the pictures. Having to look at it again while I did so was even harder than packing, I think, but it is done. It was unnecessary, as I have already asked her via text to never contact me again, but it is satisfying to know that she will have to come home to that. 

To answer some of the other questions posed in the thread: 

* EXIF data from the pictures said they were taken by her phone last month.
* I have racked my brain, and surprisingly, I cannot come up with any red flags about the relationship. She is a redditor, so I am trying to avoid specifics, but they were taken while she was on an extended trip. Perhaps she thought that she could have some sort of fling with someone she met and I would be none the wiser.
* I can't explain why she left a folder containing these pictures on her laptop. It seems incredibly stupid to me, but it isn't like they were in plain sight. They were among a number of other, seemingly benign pictures.
* I do not believe she wanted me to find out; she seems very upset and has been begging me to talk with her about it.

Finally, I just want to reiterate: Thank you, Reddit. The support, the stories, and the kind words have meant more than any of you could know. ",1400681970.0,I (27M) just found pics of her (27F) cheating,0.95

Hey Guys! It's been a while, but I remembered this post by chance yesterday and decided to follow up.

A lot of people in the original post said that he would likely lose interest within the next couple months. Well, here we are 7 months later, and he's still playing. The thing is, he got my mom to start playing with him! I pretty much never play now, but they have a great time playing together. My mother started in December, but she's already passed me in level and I think she has more Pokemon registered in her pokedex than my dad. I also haven't heard her complain about her foot pain in a while, so I don't think that should be an issue now. He has also stopped asking me so many questions and wanting that to be our only conversation topic, but that's probably also because he is now as experienced in the game as I am, if not more.

Over the weekend, we all went out for dinner, and were walking around the outside mall while waiting for our table to be ready. My mom whispered a little ""Omg!"" and showed us that there was a Tyranitar right across the street. For those who don't know, it's an extremely rare pokemon, and I think the most powerful one in the game right now, barring a legendary. We were all able to catch it :)
That's really all there is to say, and I think I was just worried that it would devolve into something addictive and unhealthy. But I see now that it's a fun little activity for the both of them, and I am glad we are all able to bond through it.

After making the post, I re-evaluated the relationship and had a talk with X. Against my better judgement, I decided to give him another chance. 

Anyway, I'll get to the incident which was the straw which broke the camel's back. 

Last Sunday, I enquired whether we could spend the coming Friday night together so we could get an early start to the weekend. He replied that he would let me know how his schedule worked with that.

The following day (Monday), I received a dinner invite for Friday from a bunch of good friends. Since X hadn't confirmed with me on his schedule yet, I assumed things were still up in the air with him so I accepted the invitation. 

I informed X that I would be doing dinner with my friends, so I would be meeting him a couple of hours later than I had initially suggested. He FLIPPED OUT on me. 

He yelled and screamed at me on the phone, cursing me out and demanding to know who was so fucking important I was going to meet. He asked me if a frivolous dinner with mere friends meant more to me than spending time with my SO. 

I responded that of course I valued my SO's, however there were other people I also liked to have in my life. He told me I could go and date those people then.

He went on at how I was incredibly disrespectful towards his time and that I was jerking him around. I told him that I didn't see how that counted as being disrespectful of his time since it was only Monday and the invite was for Friday - I was keeping him updated of the dinner way in advance so that he could plan his time for those couple of hours ; it wasn't as though I was pushing plans back at the very last minute or even cancelling on him. 

I told him that in my perspective, since he had yet to get back to me on his schedule I had the impression that we weren't confirmed hence accepted the invite.  I also told him that from my point of view, when I make plans with someone for the whole weekend and they push things back a couple of hours (for whatever reason) it wouldn't be a big deal to me so I didn't see why he was being so drastic. 

He then said to enjoy myself with my friends and that he hoped the dinner would be worth the cost of our relationship. I responded 'ok'. 

There's still some stuff that both of us have at each other's places though so we're meeting up later this week to return things. 

Tl;dr - he made things easy by breaking up with me.

I've been putting off writing this update for a few days, the thought of it makes me nauseous but i think you all deserve a follow up after helping me threw this. I'll start by saying the person this been caught, i'll lead up the details.

In the original post i made an small update that I was setting a trap on Facebook by posting multiple photo that were slightly different and only visible to certain groups. Unfortunately this did not work because Literotica removed this posts and the account, i'm happy its gone but i didn't have another way to find out. I tried pushing it out of my mind and took a break from social media, also my cousin Dan (police officer M/27) moved in with after this and it really helped me feel safe.

For about three weeks I didn't go out aside from work and errands, put off friends who (at the time) didn't know why. I figured it was easier to shut out everyone until i was more comfortable. By this point I just accepted that it was a fucked up prank or someone else using a friends account and that i needed to move on. 

Out of the blue I get a visit from a girl Lorrie, I know her as the off-on girlfriend of David (M/34) although this was my first time meeting or speaking to her. David was like a ""big brother"" to my cousin Dan; when Dan moved to LA David let him stay with him until he got a job, David helped him get his first car, David introduced him to his ex-wife and later helped him through the divorce. I always saw him as the nice guy that helped Dan and I through rough times. 

Lorrie is crying and having a breakdown on my porch, I couldn't make out a word she was saying through the wheezing and sobbing. She calms down a bit and says she's called the cops on David. Then she told me everything. She had been getting into fights with him after he kept talking about me, bringing me up at inappropriate times. She was convinced he was cheating on her and she looked threw his laptop hoping to find photos or messages. She found screenshots of Literotica stories, the photoshopped pictures, and a collection of child pornography videos.

My heart breaks just typing this, how can people be so fucking disgusting. He has a 4 year old daughter, they've found videos of her too.

[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/) It didn't get a lot of traction but I was asked for an update, so here it is. I write nothing but novellas.

I know a lot of people wanted me to call out my dad or uninvite him entirely, or basically somehow see him get what he ""deserves"". Fair enough. I felt the same way for most of my life. But I can tell you from experience that taking the scorched earth route comes with a whole lot of negatives for me and my family, including my mom. Since my mom's family is basically also my dad's family, trust me, it's so much nicer for all of us when we just don't rock that boat. And frankly, their marriage and their parenting relationship is really not my business and definitely not my responsibility.

The advice I appreciated the most and ultimately ended up following was from u/punfull who said something along the lines of: [You are a bubble floating through the breeze. You are completely unaware of any undertones or subtext or sarcasm or snottiness. You are not available for venting. You are not the mediator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lfif4/my_24f_mum_54f_has_not_seen_my_dad_52f_since/dzfpv18/)

It was such great advice that I told it to my mom, and advised that we all follow it. While punfull recommended that me and my boyfriend be the inner bubble, it ended up actually being me and my mom.

Nothing went exactly to plan, of course. For one, it turned out that my graduation tickets were indeed assigned seating, so my mom, dad and boyfriend were indeed forced to sit right next to each other, right in the front so I could watch it happen from the stage. My boyfriend's dad was unexpectedly very sick and had to cancel on dinner, so we ended up having to schedule an additional event with less friends and even more mom-dad face time. At first my parents asked which one of them should be there, and I said to both of them, ""You are both invited, and I would love it if you both could come. I trust that you guys will be able to figure it out."" My dad strongly hinted that he might not want to come to dinner after all. I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble I'm in a bubble.

As expected, my Dad and his wife were somewhat obnoxious. They rented an insanely expensive car, he talked a lot about how successful they are and how much money they make/spend, he wore an expensive patterned suit when I told him to dress casually, they drank a fair bit, he paid for everything even when my mom offered just to make a point of it, and he generally tried to steal the show when possible. They got me a really gaudy graduation present that was very expensive but not really in my taste. He made a bunch of off-colour comments, etc.

However, that said, everyone did show up to everything, and nothing terrible happened. Everyone followed their directions to distract my dad and support my mom. My boyfriend's parents spent all of their time engaging my mom, despite my dad's best efforts to pull them away. As expected, my boyfriend's dad spent basically the entire time telling sob stories, but my family dutifully smiled and nodded and only minorly made fun of him. Bf's dad was busy having fun putting two and two together insofar as where my personality comes from (i.e., I am Nana 2.0). My Nana kept repeating to everyone that we were 100% Team Mom. My friends kept everyone occupied so I could relax.

My mom handled everything like a champ. Eventually she even walked right up to Heather super confidently and introduced herself saying, ""Hello, it's so awkward to finally meet you."" Heather practically had word vomit after that which was pretty satisfying to watch lol. My mom acted and felt very comfortable. She took pictures with me and my dad and operated the camera when it was my dad and Heather. She said she honestly felt fine. She found my dad annoying AF but she always has. I was really proud of her anyways, and I told her so.

Interestingly, it was my dad that was clearly uncomfortable. He always talked louder when she came close so that she would hear him self-aggrandizing. Several times I caught him staring at her from across the table/room. Sometimes he would say something and me and my mom would laugh and roll our eyes at each other. My dad tried to make some sort of sexist joke to my boyfriend about the nursing class and he pretended not to understand. He seemed to slowly absorb that he was not the star of the show and to his credit, he never made a scene about it.

And as for me, as soon as the first meeting was out of the way and nothing terrible had happened, I immediately felt more relaxed. Stuff went wrong but I literally kept saying to myself, ""I am in a bubble, I am in a bubble,"" and it would pass. I almost fell down the stairs in my long gown and high heels while walking towards the stage, and I definitely accidentally flashed the entire audience with photo evidence. But I was pretty much riding the high and it didn't seem to matter. So yeah it went well, good times all around, the last of my family just left yesterday afternoon and I am having a good time in the bathtub, enjoying sweet silence, and being officially graduated! Thanks everyone :)

**TL;DR:** It happened. I followed u/punfull's advice of pretending I am in a bubble, unawares of the drama around me. My mom also followed this advice and we ignored everything that wasn't good and enjoyed everything that was. When not encouraged with attention, my dad was nothing worse than annoying.

MIL also went to my FWB's place to confront him, he shut the door on her face and told her to fuck off.

347,angrywidow,Non-Romantic,2yywvd,2612,"I'll try to make this brief.  My husband, Jonah, passed away unexpectedly a month ago from a stroke.  I don't want to get specific about that part, it's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still not sure how I'm ever going to move on.

We were married for 5 years, together for 7.  The past 2 years we've been trying for a baby, but were just getting to the point of considering IVF when he died.

Jonah had a close friend in high school named Marjorie.  Marjorie also ended up going to the same university as he did, and they spent a lot of time together during those college years.  Jonah said that he liked Marjorie's company, but never felt anything beyond friendship with her -- which I totally believe.  

Jonah dated other women during that period, but told me that several times Marjorie hinted that she wanted him to ask her out.  She also ""joked"" about wanting him to be her ""plan B"" in case she didn't meet someone and get married by 30.  

By the time I'd started dating Jonah, he had moved a couple hours away from his hometown (and Marjorie).  Despite this, Marjorie immediately began finding excuses to come to our town and ""hang out"" -- which usually involved her encouraging us to go drinking, and then her passing out on the couch at Jonah's apartment.  I didn't mind her for the most part, but she had a habit of saying things like, ""you know you ruined our marriage pact, haha!"" and pointing out all the things that she knew about him (like what he took in his coffee, his favorite bands, etc).

Over the course of our relationship, and especially after we got married, Jonah definitely put some distance into his relationship with Marjorie.  He confided in me that he felt he had ""outgrown her"" and that they really had little in common anymore.  He stopped responding to her invitations to hang out as often, though he would occasionally call to catch up out of guilt (especially when she would text him or leave messages saying she was ""so sad he was ignoring her"" and the like).

But now he's gone.  I had him cremated, like he wanted.  We haven't done the memorial service yet -- it was too hard for me to even imagine the first couple of weeks, and I also wanted to give time for some out-of-state people to make travel plans.  The memorial is this weekend.

However, two weeks ago, I received an email from Marjorie -- sent to around sixty people, including Jonah's family -- saying that she was holding a memorial service for Jonah in the town where they grew up (the day before his memorial here).  I was completely blown away, seeing as she hadn't mentioned anything to me or even attempted to call.  Along with the details, the email said that she was ""planning the memorial in light of the fact that no other service had yet been held in his memory, and he deserved to be laid to rest with honor"".  For the record, she was invited to the memorial which I've been planning, and knew it was happening.

I called her, of course, and told her that while I appreciated her willingness to help with Jonah's goodbye, I was already planning a service for him that would involve all of his family and friends.  She immediately went on the defensive, and said that she had ""only started to plan a service when she realized I wasn't willing to do it in a timely manner"".  I told her that the timing wasn't her choice to make, but that if she wanted to have a memorial of some kind, to please just add on the invitation that his ""official"" memorial was going to be held this weekend.  She said fine.

I sent a message to all of Jonah's invited friends/family to make sure that they knew the real service with both of our families was going to be here, and then just washed my hands of the whole thing.  

This week I received a message on facebook from Jonah's cousin, saying that Marjorie (who has apparently blocked me on facebook) created an ""event"" for Jonah's ""official"" memorial service (her memorial) and invited everyone she possibly could.  I've been getting blown up with emails asking which day the memorial is, and where.  I'm honestly furious -- I don't have the emotional energy to deal with this.  

I ended up putting a post up on my wall, reiterating the date of his service here, and asking people to please share it.  Thankfully I think the older members of the family don't use facebook or email very often, so most of them haven't been confused, but a lot of people now think that Marjorie's service is the real one.

I called Marjorie again, asking her to add an addendum to her event saying that his actual memorial was going to be here.  She told me that ""Jonah would have wanted it this way"" and that ""if I couldn't appreciate her efforts, I wasn't invited to say goodbye to Jonah.""  I told her that was fine, seeing as I'd already said goodbye to Jonah when I held him as he died.  She hung up.

Apparently she's now spreading information to her mutual friends with Jonah, saying that he was planning on leaving me because I wasn't able to conceive.  She also said that we had approached her to carry a baby for us -- all absolute lies.  His cousin sent me a screenshot of a text where she said that ""Jonah always thought we would have the cutest baby together"" and that ""AngryWidow doesn't understand how much he wants children"".

I'm at a loss as to what to do.  I don't care what she says about me, but she's now tarnishing my husband's memory -- especially saying that he wanted to divorce.  Jonah would never have left me, and anyone that knows him at all knows that we were committed to each other above all else.

I need to figure out how to tell this woman to fuck off without encouraging her to spread more lies.  And I also want to just forget the whole thing and crawl in bed and never get up again.

Help me, please.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fjg8a/a_girl_20sf_who_is_a_distant_acquaintance/

Second, thank you to everyone who responded, I can't believe so many people chimed in and posted back or PM'd. Thank you!

So...on to the dramatic conclusion!

I took your advice and decided to tell Kelly what was going on. I texted her and said ""*Hey girl, very excited about your party and thank you for inviting me! I'm sorry to do this, but a few hours after I accepted your invitation I got this message from Vicky (screencap).*
*I haven't spoken to Vicky in about a year and I really don't know what this is all about but I do know I don't want to cause any drama at your party. Would it be easier on you if I stayed away? I just want what works best for you.*""

15 minutes later I got a text from Kelly that said ""*WTF?!?*""

I started to text back but Kelly called me while I was typing. She was *pissed*

Kelly basically asked what Vicky's problem was and I told her I didn't know, she'd gone on one bad date with my brother a year ago and we didn't really hit it off as friends and this is the first time I'm hearing from her. I told Kelly I felt really bad and didn't want to cause any problems for her. 

Kelly said ""I can't believe she has the *nerve* to try and uninvite people from *my* party. That message is so middle school! This is...oh my god I'm so mad! Quinoafan I have to go, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. I'm not mad at you, I'll get back to you I promise. I've got to sort this out.""

Well long story short Kelly called Vicky and basically ripped her a new one. Apparently (as told to me by Kelly) Vicky tried to act like she had no idea what Kelly was talking about until Kelly texted her the picture I took.

Vicky then said I had to be making it up and that I've been bullying and harassing and stalking her and that I'm a jerk, etc. She basically tried to make it look like I made it up, ""hacked"" into her account, and that I've always treated her like crap. She then said because I treat her so bad she didn't know why someone as awesome as Kelly would be my friend let alone want me at her party and that she (Vicky) could use her (Kelly's) support.

Kelly was having none of it. She basically said that she knew me and knew I would NEVER do something like that and also that even if I was that type of person there's no way I could know her information to get into her facebook. 

She said that Vicky must think she's really stupid to try and pull that kind of bullshit on her and who the hell did she think she was trying to stir up this drama and tell people they couldn't come to her party? Kelly then said Vicky started crying and swearing she was telling the truth and why wouldn't Kelly believe her and why was she being a drama queen, etc.

Kelly promptly uninvited Vicky from the party and said they were no longer friends and that she couldn't believe how much of a jerk Vicky is. Kelly unfriended and deleted her from all social media.

Kelly called all her friends and asked if they had gotten similar messages from Vicky but no one had, so apparently Vicky actually had a personal problem with me and wasn't trying to just uninvite people for the hell of it. I'm still not sure why she fixated on me but that's life I guess.

Vicky started harassing Kelly and calling her names on the phone until Kelly blocked her. According to mutual friends Vicky is making posts on facebook about shallow girls and their drama and how the people closest to you always betray you etc.

I didn't hear from Vicky again but I blocked her to be safe. I told my brother what happened and he just rolled his eyes and said he isn't the least bit surprised because ""Vicky is a fucking psycho and basket case.""

Kelly treated me to coffee to make up for what happened to me even though I said there was nothing to apologize for but she insisted. We had a nice time even though Kelly was in a bad mood for a bit and angry she had thought Vicky was a friend and that she had known Vicky was a problem but she had compassion for her and felt everyone deserves a chance and mad that Vicky took advantage of that.

I'm not surprised since Kelly is a really nice person but I cheered her up and Kelly is feeling much better now. She says I have to come to her party or she'll kick my butt and I promised I would be there.

All in all, there was some drama but it's over now and I'll be honest I feel a lot more relaxed that icky Vicky won't be there and that Kelly believed me right from the get go and didn't think I was trying to start drama. It actually felt really good that she never once doubted me and believed me from the start. I need to get more coffee with her.

349,livingindoozyworld,Personal issues,b7f10e,2612,"My situation is really weird. 

**Explanation:** I'm what the deaf (non-verbal audio) classify as Hard hearing (HH) because I can communicate with hearing person without resorting sign languages or notes. 

I met my boyfriend, ""Alan"", who is deaf about year ago. I was the only person he could communicate at work with ASL, even though I only could sign basic words. Later, he began to teach me in more advanced ASL and we found out we have so much in common in tv, movies, books tastes with similar goals and desires in life that we became best friends that evolved into a romantic relationship. We're going strong nine months now and we're compatible in every area. It's the best and healthiest relationship I ever had and I'm always excited and giddy to see him at work or when we wake up together. He feels the same and we're talking moving each other as soon his lease is up in three months from now.  

Two months ago, we decided to meet each other parents which all are hearing (he's their only deaf son). Alan met mine and it went fabulous. Then we met his parents, ""Irma"" and ""Paul"". 

I thought we got along because they were smiling, gushing and laughing but I'm beginning to believe they were putting their best masks for the sake of their son. One time on a family's bday parties, Irma said in front of the ladies with me next to her, ""It's so impressive you can talk with that speech impediment. I barely can understand you myself."" She said as jokingly manner but no one laughed, everyone glanced at each other awkwardly and I just stared at her, then excused myself. At first I wasn't sure if she meant as generational-ignorant way like ""who's the woman in the relationship?"" to the gays. I didn't mention to my boyfriend because I was hoping it was only time remark.

It wasn't. They made more comments, mostly Irma, about me struggling pronunciation or grammars, using sign language incorrectly and not teaching me the right one like Alan would do, or not having deaf/HH friends or not going more to deaf community and so on. It happened so gradual and subtle that I didn't realize they were being insulting to my face that to this day I still wonder. Most of the time they would make those comments without Alan nearby. I mentioned to Alan few times and he told me that maybe they were worried I might not understand the deaf culture. He talked to them that saying those things weren't helpful and he would appreciate if they would shut it up. They didn't.  

Few weeks ago at bbq party, Irma and Paul sort of insinuated about my parent for not giving best tool for me, saying it was a shame that my parent didn't put me in deaf school or letting me to get cochlea implant or letting me to study aboard in non-deaf university program. They made it sound as if my parent crippled me as person because my social and emotional network didn't consist the ""right"" people. This time I got angry and I said what they said was rude, that my parents made lot sacrifice for me and no one has the right to belittle for their choices about raising me. Alan caught at the end of the conversation (lipreading) and asked me what's going on. Not so surprisingly, Alan's parent threw me under the bus, remarking I was so sensitive after making such innocuous comment. Alan saw I was uncomfortable and asked me if I want to leave. I said yes and we left, when we got home he asked me what they said to me. I didn't want to say what his parent told me because it was so ugly to talk about it but I told him anyway and he got upset for me. He face-timed them and said they shouldn't said that. He told them they crossed the line. They pretended they didn't know what I was talking about, that perhaps I misunderstood, considering I'm ""hard hearing"" which upset Alan even more. They ended arguing for few minute before Alan hung up. 

Since then, Alan has become desolate and needy. He apologized to me hundred of times for not believing me what I said before. I told them that he has nothing to apologize because I wasn't sure if they were being snide toward me until now and I'm not going to blame Alan for what his parent said to me. He told me he's thinking reducing contact with them but I told Alan it wasn't necessary. He can do whatever he wants with his parent but that I rather would not go to any of his family gathering or go his parent's. He assured he would never force me or put me in that situation ever again. 

We're closer together than we were but he's still sad and he no longer goes to his family gatherings or his parent's. I find him staring at nothing in particular for long minutes and his eyes which used to sparkle are now dim. I want to cheer him up but I'm not so sure how to in first place. I just don't know what to do and I don't understand why his parents are so rude toward me because I'm not ""completely"" deaf considering they aren't one!

Sorry I'm late with the update! I've been busy since class on Friday. 

I got to class about 15 minutes early as I usually do. She happened to come in right behind me and was alone at her seat. I had planned to approach her after class, but I figured I couldn't get an opportunity better than this.

We are both from the same city so we talked a little about that. I asked her if she was free this weekend and she said she was going back home so we have a date this coming week. We have been snapchatting nonstop since.

I am getting a surprising number of PMs asking for an update so here it is. The general consensus from my first post was that I should buy a few key pairs before she gets home so I decided to go with that. It was hard because where we live we are transitioning from winter to summer so I had to buy winter boots, rain boots, sandals, runners, and various types of work shoes. Only about half of them arrived before she got home on Friday. I wish I could have bought them in person so I could have been certain they would be here, but I wasn?t able to since winter stuff is out of season and lots of the brands she likes are only available online.
 

Friday I picked her and her friends up from the airport. When we got a second of alone time I told her about the shoe situation. She was pissed initially. She wasn?t mad at me or our dog but more mad that it happened. I decided not to tell her about the awesome closet that I built her while she was gone and just hoped that the surprise would soften the blow. On the car ride back she told her friends what happened and they really helped turn it into a positive event that she could laugh about. She would only get sad when she remembered shoes that she spent a long time breaking in. Apparently her Birkenstocks took two full summers before they reached max comfiness so that was what she was the most sad about, I feel fucking awful about that. I actually took those ones to a cobbler because I KNEW she would be most upset about them but they couldn?t be salvaged, they were too far gone. 


When we got home she wanted to see the carnage. I wasn?t sure it was a good idea because I was kind of expecting her to cry but she just thought it was funny. She had me make a small pine casket for the shoes while her and her friends got absolutely blasted and we buried them in the backyard that night. She did cry briefly at the funeral but she was a trooper nonetheless. Her friends decided it was only fair for me to purchase every pair of shoes she wants for the rest of our lives and I drunkenly agreed, a decision that I?m sure will cost me a small fortune, but I stand by it all the same. 


Over the past few days she has ordered all of the shoes she needed to replace the ones she lost. She only re-ordered around 10 pairs that she previously owned, so it was a good thing I didn?t go ahead and re-order them all. She already had a Pinterest of every pair she wanted and had deemed to be worthy of her collection which made it was a fairly quick process. All in all, it cost around twice what I had anticipated but she didn?t break up with me so I?ll call it a win. I?m just glad I was able to afford it, I couldn?t imagine how awful it would be to be in this position without being able to pony up. It?s going to set me back a few months on buying an engagement ring but I?m sure that won?t be an issue. 


For everyone concerned about the dog, she isn?t worried about getting him trained more because he behaves perfectly otherwise. She said if anything, I need to be trained not to be a careless idiot. Joking aside, it was a fluke and we?re usually very good about keeping the shoes put away. I made the doors to her closet and our front closet self-closing so we don?t ever need to worry about leaving them open. Like my girlfriend, the poor guy can?t resist shoes so we don?t really blame him for what happened, in fact we are quite proud of what he managed to accomplish in the 12 hours I was away.

353,PeruvianSpiderSnake,Non-Romantic,4m6h1y,2598,"I [34F] got married to my boyfriend Dan [35M]. We have been together for 5 years now. We have been married two months now.

Dan has two siblings. Moira [32F] is great, I love her like my own sister. Smith [30M] is kind of a weird character. He is fun, in small doses. I am not annoyed with him so much as perplexed. He seems stuck in middle school. 

My wedding had a lot of small problems. I had a kid throw up on my dress, so I wore my MOH's dress while she changed into her street clothes. I tripped going up the stairs. Dan dropped his ring down the vent. One of my cousin's children knocked over a pile of cupcakes. For the most part, no one did anything on purpose and we have it on tape, which is hilarious. 

There was one incident that felt intentionally done to make my day harder for me. It was done by Smith. During the actual vows, when the priest [60sM] asked if anyone protests, forever hold your peace, Smith stood up. He said he was in love with me and didn't think I should marry his brother. Then after a few seconds of silence, he said 'wrong wedding' and walked out. I could hear him laughing about it. 

I have a little brother [25M] who was prone to stupid shit like this when he was 11. I have learned not to take it personally, I work with kids. I am used to Smith. I just felt it was stupid and made him look bad more than me. I didn't want it in the video and asked the videographer to take it out. I didn't bring it up again, I let Dan handle his family like we have agreed. I think he spoke to Smith about it, I know my MIL [60s] gave him a stern once over.

I let it go. I didn't really think about it much until we got the video and pictures. Smith was over while my cousin Cindy [40F] was. Cindy asked to see the video and pictures. I turned it on, showed her the video. It was hilarious. It was loving and beautiful. It also didn't have Smith doing something stupid. 

Smith got upset about it and said we kept all the other bad stuff, why not him. He was part of the wedding excitement. He was funny. Why didn't we keep it in? 

I told him I didn't think it was very funny, he did it to piss us off, and I didn't want it in my video. I said no hard feelings, it wasn't funny is all. 

Smith left and is actually upset about this. He has been texting Dan saying how I changed him, blah blah.

I am just not sure how to go forward from this. I feel like I am dealing with a toddler. How do I explain to Smith that he could have ruined my wedding, and most women would have flayed him alive and told him to never come into their home? I feel he owes me an apology, but don't really care that Smith thinks he is funny. I just don't want to deal with hissy fits. So what do I do?

He has played with the lego sets since he was little and even reads the books about minecraft adventures (I didn't know that was a thing!).  The only time my nephew was able to play was on my mother's tablet every once in a great while because my brother uses his laptop for work.  

I was presented with an opportunity to get a used laptop for $100.  It's not a gaming laptop by any means, but it will play minecraft just fine.  Before I bought it, I spoke with my brother and told him that I wanted to buy the laptop so that my nephew would have something to do homework on but also so he could play minecraft.  He agreed and so I bought the laptop.  I spent some time setting it up, installing minecraft and other stuff like antivirus so that it was safe for him.  I gave it to my brother last fall.  

Fast forward to just recently when I was watching my nephew for the evening.  He said he wanted to play minecraft on my computer so I agreed.  I asked him what he liked to do in minecraft, what types of things he liked to build, but he said he never got to play.  Confused, I asked why not.  He said that they didn't have a computer for him to play on.  At this point I was already pretty certain of what had happened, but I didn't want to throw my brother under the bus.  I asked if he could use his dad's laptop to play on.  He said, ""Well, his black one has it installed, but that's always at work.  His silver one is too old and slow.""  The black laptop, is the one that I gave my brother.  

I'm pissed.  I never would have spent $100 to buy my brother a laptop.  I just wanted to do something nice for my nephew.

  **tl;dr**: I bought a laptop for my nephew to use but my brother kept it for himself instead.  

Am I wrong to be upset? I understand that he is the parent but I feel taken advantage of.  I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but would it be out of line for me to demand that he either give it to my nephew or give it back?

I've known my buddy [21/M] since I started going to university 4 years ago. My girlfriend [22/F] is my best friend of 16 years and we've been dating for two months. 

She asked to borrow his laptop to do homework, when the three of us were hanging out at his home. While carrying it she slipped on a water spill, she didn't get hurt, but the laptop was damaged badly, albeit still repairable. 

My friend started losing his shit at my girlfriend, even though she apologized and offered to pay for the cost of the repair. I pulled him aside and asked why the hell he was freaking out. He said I needed to break up with my girlfriend because of how careless she was, or else we couldn't be friends anymore. Then he went on a weird rant about how I shouldn't have started dating her in the first place because I deserve better, but I think he was projecting hard about something.

It boggles my mind that he wants me to break up with her because she accidentally damaged his laptop, over his negligence in not cleaning up the spilled water. I'm not breaking up with my girlfriend, so I assume my friendship with him is over. 

The thing is, he's a member of our team [5 people including myself] for the video game [League of Legends] that we play. He's irreplaceable, there's no one that we know of who is equal in skill level to him, that also plays his role. We take the game very seriously by meeting up and practicing every weekend, going over our replays to see how we can get better, improve our communication, etc. 

I don't want to play with him anymore, or have him on the team because of the way he handled everything. I'm not sure how, or if I should bring up what happened to my other teammates.

356,kaypond,Updates,9uugfu,2588,"Second time trying to post this cuz automod removed it for not having an original post link but it did. 

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8x63sx/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_regularly_does_things_he/?_branch_match_id=509169239196061035) 


I appreciated the responses from everyone who commented. I don't really want to make this update but since you guys made the time to comment, I guess you deserve an update. After the post a few months ago, he had read all of the comments and begged me not to leave him. He apologized and swore he would change. He didn't.

When I made that post, I did not expect the comments to be unanimous in saying that he was abusive. And I slowly came around to that idea. Some of those comments were a huge wake up call for me, and I started realizing just how horrible I had been treated the entire relationship. Apologizing profusely for unwanted attention from men, swearing I would never be nice to them or even talk to them again, reassuring him that my outfit wasn't revealing. It was my first relationship and I just didn't know how abusive all of this was. I don't want to be with someone who controls and micromanages my social media, dictates what I wear and my hairstyles, accuses me of being unfaithful or doing slutty things for men, tells me ""I'm not going to have sex with you after we break up if you start adding other guys"", constantly lies about his feelings for women in his life, and much much more.

2 nights ago he was bothering me because he wasn't responding to a question I'd asked him, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I broke up with him. We broke up via text because he always refused to meet me in person when I wanted to break up. I guess he thought if he refused to meet me in person to say goodbye then I would wait to break up with him, and he was right because it did deter me a few times (we live an hour away). But this time I knew he would be immature and not want to meet with me so I just had to message it to him which sucks, because it feels really awful to end a year and 4 months relationship via text.

All he had to do was try. The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can't bring himself to treat me right. No matter how trustworthy I was to him, he only ever saw me as the kind of girl who would run off with another guy the second she had a chance, a girl who loves male attention. No matter how much i was there for him and I tried everything to motivate him and comfort him through his struggles, he just couldn't force himself not to act in a way that he knew was wrong. Which was extreme jealousy, disrespect towards me, lying, cynicism towards all men and their intentions, and toxicity.

The past month I would just be disgusted with myself for letting myself be treated like that. Every day I would be resentful and think to myself, ""what the fuck am I doing with someone abusive who doesn't try for me, when (for the most part), I am a really good girlfriend to him?"" I know my worth now. I am a very generous and loving girl that I think a respectful and kind person would be lucky to have.

I'm still having thoughts that it feels wrong to not be with him, and I feel guilty for having freedom and doing what I want. I really have struggled with guilt and anxiety from this breakup.

All in all I am truly thankful for the comments on the original post who I probably wouldn't be here without. So thank you. I feel free. I haven't even cried yet. I feel like I did the right thing even though I am really sad. I am finally putting myself first despite how hard it is. I know he will read this and I originally wrote something to him but I don't want to put more of his personal info on the internet than necessary. In the end he is not a horrible person by any means, nor is he a sociopath like someone said in the last post. It sucks things can't work out right now at least.

Tldr: he continued to be abusive and i finally grew a pair and left him. Learned to never stay with someone who doesn't match your effort.

edit: thanks so much you guys for the comments, i cant reply to them all. you really give me strength which i lack so much of right now. i know i did the right thing even though it feels wrong and pretty miserable right now. so thank you for the reassurance... every comment honestly does make me feel better.",1541552347.0,"Update: My [19F] boyfriend [20M] regularly does things he would be furious at me for, like hanging out with the opposite sex and more",0.97
357,ruinedproposal,Relationships,4jkljq,2580,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years, I know she's been wanting to get married and wanting for me to propose for a really long time. I've always put it off cause I never felt I was at the right spot for it, and I wanted to wait for the right time.  Nevertheless, I know she's been waiting for it patiently for a long time, and if it was up to her, we would have gotten married years ago before I was even ready.

Anyway, I figured since she's waited so long, I wanted to make it as perfect for her as possible.  I chose the weekend of our 6th anniversary of our first date to propose to her.  I was planning to have her come over to our house, I would have my mum and sister vacate for the night, and I would prepare a very nice dinner for her and would propose during that.

I had written out this really long speech which I'd memorised after much practice because I wanted it to be perfect.

Now my girlfriend has always wanted me to learn how to cook. I'm ashamed to say I've never properly learned how to cook, and I've never been really good at it.  Since I live with my mother and sister at home, they always cook for me and they've never really needed me to cook. Its always one or the other of them, or both of them, doing cooking.  At best, I'd just do washing up or chop up onions or something simple.

I told them ""look, I desperately need to learn how to cook a very nice meal."" I told them she's always wanted me to learn how to cook, and it would be great if I could surprise her with this excellent dinner that I've made myself, she would never expect it from me, she would be thrilled.  I told them I might just need some guidance.

They weren't that enthusiastic first, they were like ""we're really busy, we don't have time to teach a child how to cook."" I told them its really important, and to help them understand the gravity of the situation, I told them I was proposing tonight.

They both went crazy and excited, like ""oh my God oh my God, have you bought a ring yet?""  I showed them the ring, and my sister went flipping crazy, screaming, crying tears.  I told them I was probably going to ask for their opinion on it any way, and they were really enthralled and so excited and happy for me.  My sister was literally crying and breathing heavily.

They asked for details and everything about how I was going to propose, I recited the long speech I'd memorised.  They told me it was beautiful, they love it, she'll love it, again my sister was crying even.

I told them so this is why I need to cook tonight, she's always wanted me to learn to cook, and if I make a nice meal for her, I want to make our night as magical as possible.  My sister was like ""no way, if you cook, you'll fuck it up. Just let us cook for you, and say you did it."" I said, no, it has to be me, it has to be me. It's really important that I do it, I don't want to deceive her.

We reached a compromise and they said we can do it together, my mum supervised, my sister will take charge, and I'll basically just follow instructions and help her out.  It turned out going really good, but how much I really contributed is questionable, they ended up taking way too much over me, way more than I had planned. I had wanted to do it all myself with their guidance, but I ended up being just a 'helper' while my sister did most of the work.  I didn't want to let that spoil the night so I just let it go.

Then my girlfriend arrived at the door, and my mum and sister were getting ready to go out.  When they greeted her, my mum was acting cool, polite, very poker face about it, I guess cause she's a mature adult.  My sister on the other hand was acting like a jittery little school girl, just jumping out, it was really cringey and awkward to watch.  She kept telling my girlfriend how beautiful she looked tonight, how excited she was for her, how we were perfect for each other.  The way she was smiling and acting too excited really gave it all away, she said ""he's got something really really special planned for you.""

I kept trying to push her out the door and telling her to shut up, but she just wouldn't, and she kept chatting to my girlfriend. I wanted to push her out, by my girlfriend told me I was being rude to her, and I should let the talk.  I just sighed and knew it would end badly, but my sister kept being as unsubtle as possible, ""I really wish I could be a fly on the wall here tonight"" ""you are so so lucky"" ""if only you knew"".

My girlfriend was then ""is he going to propose?"" My sister didn't say yes or no, she just gritted her teeth in a big smile like ""mmmnnnnngghhhhh :) :) :) :) ""  I didn't even get a chance to say anything, and my girlfriend just started screaming and crying and hugging me suffocating me.  My mum was trying to pull my sister away, but she just started screaming ""SHOW HER THE RING! SHOW HER THE RING!"" I told her to seriously shut the fuck up, and that my mum was clearly waiting for her ,but she kept shouting ""show her the ring!"".  I tried to explain to them that this really wasn't the way I had planned it, I wanted to do it when we were alone and I had  a long speech planned.  They both just wanted to see the ring.  I said can I at least say the speech? My sister was like ""you should let him say it, its a really beautiful speech.""  I started and I'd barely got two sentences in when she interrupted me and was like ""actually its too fucking long, you can say it later, just show her the ring.""

I wanted to wait until we were alone so I could say the speech and THEN show the ring, but they were both literally screaming at me to show them. I told my sister she'd already seen it, she said she wanted to see it again and my girlfriend told me I had to show it to her now. I showed them the ring again and they both started shouting and screaming, they literally both jumped on me and pinned me to the couch like a lion grappling a dying elephant, and ripped the ring from my hand like a lion tearing meat from its prey.  I told them to get off they were suffocating me, but they were both literally hugging me to death while screaming like hyenas into my ears. It was like WWE or something, it was unreal.  I tried to pull away but they were both just hugging and kissing me and screaming into my ears, clawing at me and the ring like rapid animals, squeezing and suffocating me; my mother did nothing to help, she just stood there laughing as I went down.

I realised they were mainly interested in the ring so I let them have it and crawled away to the side of the couch where I could breath properly. I felt the evening was ruined already, I had nearly just been clawed to death, I didn't know if my clothes were ripped, my hair was completely messed up, I had both their lipsticks smudged on my face from their dual hyena attack, and my clothes were a complete mess now.  It was an infuriating mess of a situation and I felt gross.  I just sat quietly there for at least two hours while my mother, girlfriend, and sister sat together looking at the ring, talking and chatting amongst themselves and acting like I wasn't there.

The entire evening was ruined.  My mum and sister were meant to be going out for the night, they didn't even leave once and were there the entire time.  The food that ""I"" had made was getting cold.  I told them dinner was getting cold, they all said they weren't hungry, and just sat there looking at the ring, obsessing over it like they are freaking gollum or something.

Me, the boyfriend, the groom, may have as well been invisible, they were all completely ignoring me, pretending like I wasn't there.  I had planned this perfect evening between my girlfriend and I were I could propose, I'd been preparing it for such a long time. It was completely hijacked by my mother and sister, my sister spoiled it, and didn't even feel bad about it.  Worst of all, my girlfriend didn't even seem to mind.

I told her this wasn't the evening I had in mind, she didn't care, she was too excited about the fact we're finally engaged.  I didn't even get a chance to say my speech.  She was like ""don't worry you can say it tomorrow, I'm too tired now.""  It really hurt my feelings, I don't think she understood how sad that made me feel.

My girlfriend didn't even seem to care that it wasn't even really me who proposed to her,and the way my sister was acting, you'd think like she was the one getting married.  This entire evenign I'd planned out for so long... I'd been entirely cut out of it. Sidelined. Reduced to a spectator.

After we finally did have the dinner, I asked my girlfriend if we could spend some time together in bed before she goes back home for the night.  She was like ""we can't, your mum and sister are here, we can't just leave them.""  I told her they weren't even meant to be here, they were meant to have gone out tonight, and they both were like ""yeah, yeah, go upstairs, don't worry about us."" I told her she really shouldn't worry about them , we should both just go upstairs and spend some time together, she was like no, it would feel too weird and awkward.

Well, that sucked so much. i felt like the entire night was ruined. I'd barely gotten anything out of it, I didn't even spend any time with my girlfriend.  My sister completely spoiled and ruined everything, the entire night was hijacked.

I tried to explain to my girlfriend why everything that had happened, including her own behaviour and acceptance of it, really bothered me.  She didn't seem to understand and just brushed it aside. I explained to my mum, and she sort of understood and was apologetic, but tried to dump most of the blame on my sister.  My sister was still in an excited giddy mood, I asked her what was wrong with her, she said nothing. I told her she'd ruined the entire night and she acted like a 12 year old or a clown, she got offended and denied it.  She refused to see what she'd done wrong and how she'd ruined everything.  I don't undersetand her behaviour at all or why she would even act that way.

Basically, I'm kind of hurt and offended by everything that's happened and the way they reacted to it.  Do I have the right to feel this way? Should I just let it go and move on or is there something I can do so that my grievances don't go unaddressed and ignored?

**TLDR: planned a magical evening with my girlfriend (of six years) to propose to her.  My sister and mother spilled the beans on everything, hijacked it, and ruined the entire night.  Everyone completely ignored me when it was supposed to be a night of my girlfriend and I.  Nobody acts like they did anything wrong, they all think it was perfectly fine and brush aside it when I try to explain how hurt I am by what they all did and how I didn't like being basically pushed to the side, ignored for hours, and ruining all my plans. Am I right to feel this way? What should I do about it?**

358,SensitiveKitchen7,Non-Romantic,bke0dw,2579,"My younger brother, let's call him John \[18\], was subjected to random drug testing at his high school last week. (He knew he was eligible for it, students must sign a consent form at the start of the school year). He is a frequent smoker, and tested positive for weed. He tried to get ahead of the situation by telling my parents what had happened. My parents freaked out, acted like John is a complete failure, and started to think of ways to punish him. My parents and my brother already didn't have a great relationship, and this event made it much worse. Thankfully nothing criminal will come of this, John just has to take an online drug counseling course. He is going off to college this fall.

&#x200B;

I \[23F\] am in graduate school in another state. I never smoked in high school, and now in college it's a very infrequent activity, mostly when I'm home by myself to de-stress or at small social gatherings. Weed has never negatively impacted my life, I've gotten good grades, internships, fully-funded grad school, never in trouble with the law. I've always had a great relationship with my parents and feel close to them. 

&#x200B;

Now, my brother and I haven't always had the greatest relationship. My parents tend to view me as the ""golden child"" and compare my brother and I. I've tried to be close with my brother but I think he feels some anger towards me because of my parents. However, one thing John and I recently bonded over was weed. I suspected he smoked and told him I have too. Our relationship improved a bit, I think it helped him see me as more relatable and more of a friend. We talked about it a few times but never smoked together or anything like that.

&#x200B;

Now, back to my parents finding out about John and freaking out. My parents decided they were going to drug test him from now on, and he could lose his phone, car, and even college if he keeps smoking. Well, John ended up ratting me out to my parents (who had NO idea I'd ever smoked). I think he threw me under the bus to try and make his actions look better. Now, my parents are saying that to be fair, they're going to drug test both of us, and if I test positive they will take my car. My parents seemed like they don't really want to drug test me - in fact, my mom said she would try and tell me in advance of when they would do it - but they want to be ""fair"". Keep in mind, I am still living out of state this summer, so any drug testing would take place when I visit home (which is only going to happen a few times).

&#x200B;

I wasn't planning on smoking the next few months because my internship random drug tests. However, I feel like my parents aren't respecting my decisions and privacy as an adult. It isn't like I still live at home, and weed isn't impacting my life in any way. It was solely my brother's fault that he got caught. Additionally, my boyfriend lives in a state where weed is legal, so really, what do they expect? The only thing that still ties me to my parents is that they own the car I drive. They agreed to let me drive this when I started grad school, as they knew I wouldn't make much money and they valued me furthering my education. However, I pay for everything else myself.

&#x200B;

Do you think my parents are being reasonable? Is it fair to apply John's punishment to me, even though we are at very different stages in our lives? How can I tell my parents I am uncomfortable with this while maintaining a good relationship? And how do I address this breach of trust with my brother? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My younger brother got caught smoking weed, and my parents plan to randomly drug test him. He snitched to them that I've smoked too, and now they want to drug test me.

Edited to add: My brother came to me right after he was tested asking for help and advice. right after this situation went down, I was very clear with my parents that I have smoked and I thought they were overreacting. I defended my brothers actions and tried to educate them about marijuana. Many people are attacking me for the way my brother has been treated but I have very much supported and defended him.",1556920543.0,"My brother [18M] got caught smoking weed; now my parents [51F, 56M] want to drug test me too [23F] to be ""fair"".",0.97

This is an update to a post I made about three and a half months ago. I apologize that I am updating under a new username; I can't remember the password for the other throwaway I was using and never registered it to an email. Oops. I'm sorry it took so long to update; a lot has happened and I've done my best to keep busy.



I want to extend my thanks to everyone who took the time to read my post, especially those who replied. I guess I kind of always knew in the back of my mind that my relationship was abusive, but felt that I needed permission to leave. I know that doesn't make sense. I guess I was just feeling so beat down by that point that I didn't even feel like I had enough agency to make my own decisions.



Several of you expressed genuine fear for my safety, and a few suggested that I just up and leave while he was at work one day. That particular scenario didn't end up happening, but here's the story of what did happen.



I managed to hold out for about another week or so after my original post. It was such a big decision, I wanted to make sure that I had all my bases covered before talking to him (apartment, possessions, cat, etc). I became more and more visibly depressed with each passing day - not sadness due to leaving, but just... a sad person. He eventually ended up asking me what was wrong when we were lying in bed one night, and I told him I was not happy in this relationship and that I wanted to end things. He took it quite well at first, and we managed to have some remarkably productive and civil discussions about how to proceed with belongings/living situation/etc, but of course that didn't last. He moved out about a week after our relationship ended (he insisted he be the one to leave). I had nowhere else to go at the time, otherwise I would not have dealt with his bullshit for as long as I did after the breakup.



He spent the next couple of days after the breakup basically sobbing and trying to convince me to take him back and give him another chance, but I stood my ground and refused to do so. Then, he devolved into insulting me, harassing me, and blaming me for perceived problems in his life.



I'll spare you all of the ridiculous dramatic details, but there came a point where he was incessantly asking me to have sex with him 'one last time for closure.' I told him no, kept telling him no, and he said that if I wouldn't do it, then our breakup would no longer be civil, that I ruined that for myself, and that my decision to say no didn't deserve to be respected. I still said no. He slammed his fists down on the arms of the chair he was sitting on, and got up and came at me. We were the only two people in the house at the time, and I fled. I spent most of the night in my car in a grocery store parking lot a few towns away, only returning home when several roommates were around and awake. I feared for my safety otherwise. In retrospect, calling the cops would absolutely have been the best route to take, but I was so fucking horrified and exhausted that it didn't even cross my mind at the time. The next day was his move-out date, and I was so happy. While he was getting all of his shit out of the house, I went shopping. I bought a new bedding set, new curtains, some minor decor, and rearranged my whole bedroom as a mini fresh start. I really had a new outlook on things.



My roommates ended up kicking me out a couple weeks later so they could move him back in. He roped them in with his stories of how much he was suffering after I left him, how he was having such a hard time, how they're his only friends in the world, and how awful I am. These roommates were some of the best friends I ever had - lifelong friends, like since childhood... Having nowhere else to go, I pulled some pretty big strings and moved in with a relative in a nearby town and started to build my life back up. My ex started dating one of our mutual friends from uni about 2 weeks after we broke up - someone I was always suspicious of, but he always told me to never worry about her. So, there's that. Hope they're having fun or whatever. A mutual acquaintance has told me that he treats her the same way he always treated me.



Things are much better now. I have since saved up some money, quit my soul-sucking job, and now live and work in a different city fairly far away. It is really nice to not have to worry about running into my ex or my ex-roommates/friends. I've also started seeing someone else. He's been in a very similar situation to what I experienced. So, we are making sure to pace ourselves and we always try our best to be mindful of each others' needs and feelings, as well as our own needs and feelings. He treats me with genuine respect, and while things are still pretty new, I am optimistic about this, as well as my future in general. I'm pretty busy these days, but once I get health insurance from my new job, I am going to set up regular therapy appointments to help process all of these changes in my life, as well as my attitudes about healthy relationships and about my own self-worth.



Random internet strangers, thank you so much for being so kind and caring to a scared, tired, just plain beat-down woman. Your words gave me the boost of momentum I needed to solidify my decision to get the fuck out. I am so glad I did.

I grew up with my mom and older brother. When my mom died my brother became my guardian. He took good care of me and always made me feel safe and comfortable. He has been mother and father and brother for me at the same time.

Two years ago my father came back and asked to be a part of our lives again. He said that he's changed and wants to make things right. He initially used to come around once a week for a few hours and it was nice. However recently in the past two months, he is acting creepy which makes me uncomfortable.

He texts me about my looks all the time. Tells me I look like a complete woman now. It makes me feel weird. Last week he asked me about my sex life which I'm not comfortable talking to him about it. He asked if I watch porn and if I do, what positions I like. I mean this is creepy right? I don't like it. My brother talked to me about sex but it was about safety and consent and things like that. Never these details that my father asks.

I want him to stop these things, and that's all he talks about. Honestly I want him to stay away from me I don't like him, he gives me bad vibes. I know he's my father but I don't see him as family. He's just another person to me, a creepy person that makes me uncomfortable.

She started transitioning early on in our relationship, but honestly, not that much changed. It was a year before she met my family due to timing, location, etc. They all loved her though. We eventually moved closer and she spends a lot of time with my family, especially my brother and his kids and me. 

About two weeks ago, hanging out at a backyard BBQ with my family, some of her friends, etc, the subject of kids comes up. Annie and I are not having kids, as we're not interested. But someone came up with the whole ""Oh you'll love them when their your own"" stuff and Annie just smiled and said, very politely, ""Oh, I can't have children. And I'm not interested.""

So the nosy nelly pressed, asking why not, why doesn't she try IVF, etc. Annie just said, ""Well, I don't have the parts, for one.""

Nosy Nelly, confused, asked what she meant.

Let me preface this next part by saying that we never purposely kept that she was MtF away from the family. It just never came up, and it's not like it's their business. 

Annie said, ""Oh, I was born with male genitalia and all that, that's all.""

Nosy Nelly thought she was joking, but eventually caught on. Her entire demeanor changed. She got up and moved, she started whispering with other people. But no one had the audacity to say anything to us.

Two days later, a message on Facebook:

Nosy Nelly:
Hi. I'm sorry to inform you that I'm no longer comfortable with having Annie babysit the kids anymore. I'd also like it if you could please keep me informed if she is attending any mor BBQs or events. I don't feel she's a good influence to have around my children.

I was shocked to get this and didn't know how to respond. As the day went on, a few more messages like that came in. I haven't told Annie yet, because I want a chance to fix this or do something before she finds out.

I applied for a job at a company a couple of weeks ago, really seemed like a job I'd like to do. It was becoming a junior web designer at a company. I'd been interested in it for a while and I have been teaching myself how to do it amongst other things by using books, reddit and just reading about it online. It's been fun and I've been loving it. Anyway, I work at a typical job, a supermarket and I have been looking for another job for a while as I wanted a career and to start doing something with my life. I mainly do online job searching. I saw the job advertisement for a junior web designer at this company and they said they would teach you everything on the job, no experience needed. Seemed ideal to me and I thought I'd give it a shot. What's the worst that can happen? So a couple of days after applying I got a e-mail and then a phone call from HR and they said they wanted me to come in for a first round interview. Of course I said yes. 

I went along to the interview, very nervous as this was the first 'real' job I've ever had an interview for. I asked for advice from some co-workers and that helped me feel better and get a clearer head. I got there a littl early and waited nervously. 

The assessments were for English, Maths and Logic. Now, I will be the first to admit, I do really suck at maths. I just don't get it. I can't really do it. I'm not totally unable but it gets hazy when percentages, fractions, diving large numbers, times tables, ect it gets hard for me. But I have been trying to improve my maths! It sounds stupid but I've been doing maths homework with my younger brother who is in secondary school, final year, and it's been helping me out loads. I got maths training games too. 

So I did the assessments and I didn't really do well at the maths I thought. I came out of the interview feeling unconfident but I tried to not let that show through. They said they will be in contact with me. 

A day later, I got a Facebook message in my outbox and it was from someone I didn't know. I read through this message and was gobsmacked. I don't know what to think. Here is the message: 

""Hi OP,

I am just e-mailing you to let you know you definitely won't be getting there job at _____. You are a different shade of absolute stupidity. I work here and I'm the head of the department of which you applied for. I would never in my life ever employ someone who is as utterly simple and unable to do maths. It's a shame as you aced your other tests. But English and logic aren't a sign of intelligence to me. Maths is. You should be ashamed of yourself and go pick up a maths book and learn. No one will take you seriously in life. I seriously hope you take my advice. Your life won't be anything more than menial jobs. 

Take care,

Well the holiday season is over now and there's a lot to tell you guys about how everything went down.  Things didn't end up as well as I'd hoped but they weren't as bad as I feared so honestly I would call that a win.  Let's start with how I told Claire about not going to Christmas Eve.

I basically told her what sarah8 said: ""Your dad's family isn't ready to accept you for who you are, and that is their loss. They are in denial, and they think that they can change you by not inviting you for Christmas. I'm sorry Claire. We both know you deserve better.""  She didn't take it well.  She was heartbroken but I knew she would be no matter what.  That night we had ice cream and she just cried for a while and I comforted her.

I researched a bit on the churches in our area and called a few to ask about their views on transgender people and found one that might work before I asked Claire if she wanted to go with me to a midnight mass.  She was grateful that I would go with her and we went to a nice mass that was not so religious that I felt uncomfortable, but religious enough for her to enjoy mass.  We will probably continue going there in the future.

Christmas Day was good.  She invited one of her closest friends over for a while so that she wasn't the only teenager.  She loved her present from me.  I got her those fake gel insert breasts and some nice bras so she can feel more like a woman instead of a little kid.  Some of you might tell me she isn't old enough for a gift like that but I could tell it made her feel more comfortable in her own skin.

The bad part is that she's still hung up over her father not wanting to see her.  I learned recently that she emailed him or Facebook messaged him and begged him to at least come to our Christmas or come visit and she never got a reply.  Last week we went to her therapist and so far it didn't seem to help.  I think she's still in shock that someone she loves so much sees her as something that shouldn't exist.  We're still trying to work through it.  I contacted some of her aunts and uncles but they don't want to see her either.  It's upsetting but we will find a way.

Claire also read some of your responses to my first post and she wanted to say thank you.  I wanted to thank you as well.  We're just going to send her father some research on trans people and hope he eventually sees the light.

366,strfcker,Non-Romantic,7if511,2556,"I consider myself as being happy that I can maintain a small number of circles of friends with some overlap between them. I'm even more extremely grateful to have this core group that I've grown up with for most of my life that stays mostly separate from the rest of the circles because it gives me the chance to speak *in confidence* about other people without any bias in the opinions that they give to me.

Recently I found out that said closer circle of friends had been playing pranks on me for the greater part of this year, and had been getting a kick out of watching my frustration with new friends I had made this year decide to cut contact with me. I only found out as in a group chat I'm in someone accidentally referenced an event I had not told them about in a way that could only be described as them being orchestrators behind the drama.

Turns out this insider knowledge came from my closest friend who had been actively reading my messages on numerous social media on my devices and with the help of the others in the group, began thinking and acting out ways to subtly mess with these newly-formed friendships and relationships.

They've told me that they only went after specific people that they deemed that my relationships with them won't last, and I had to agree to disagree because it was as a result of their interference with them that they didn't. And it hurts me deeply because I tried to be a more open person this year and I wanted these new relationships I made to work but negative experience after negative experience led me to returning to being defensive and overly-cautious with making genuine lasting friendships and relationships.

I'm not sure how I'm to make a decision to address this. One part of me tells me to cut these people out of my life but I had known them for so long that to do so would leave a big hole where the mostly positive experiences I've had with them would be. What do you guys think I should do?

Lots have happened in the past few days. I'd like to thank all of you who helped me and gave me different opinions, especially those of you who shared personal experiences. Quick summary: My mom confessed that I have a twin brother who she gave away for adoption shortly after we were born because she was alone and didn't have the means to take care of two kids.

First about my mom. I talked to her at length about how I feel and told her everything that I felt. That I understood the situation she was in and how this was the most difficult decision of life, how it's easy to blame her for it but that she did what she thought was right, and how I really don't blame her for doing it or for not telling me, but I would have preferred if she had told me sooner. She asked if I would forgive her? I said even though there's nothing to forgive but yes. To be honest she's at ease now, more than she's ever been. She told me a few times that now she feels unburdened, which I'm happy for her. For all the problems that we had she always took care of me to the best of her abilities and I know nobody loves me in the world more than she does.

About my brother, I decided to contact his parents, reach out and ask whether they have told him, what they think about this whole thing and how they want to go forward. I know we are 20 and I didn't have to contact them, but I thought reaching out to them was the best idea. I don't want to create a mess in my brother's life, in case he doesn't know. So I found his mom on Facebook and sent a message, mostly what /u/jpallan suggested in the previous thread. I explained who I am, that was just informed of the whole thing, that I'm interested in getting to know my brother, etc. I left my phone number too.

She called me a few hours later and asked how I was doing, she was really friendly and asked if we can meet to talk. We arranged a meeting for the next day (yesterday), in my town even though I was willing to go there but she insisted.

So we met at a caf?. I was very stressed and really didn't know how it was going to go. I couldn't have guessed. She was very friendly and nice. When we started talking she was just looking at me. She told me that I have my brother's eye and hair color, our eyes are the same color, my fingersnails look exactly like his, that I smile like him. Honestly it was getting a little strange. She had tear in her eyes and cried a few times. She told me about how she wanted to adopt both of us but my mom couldn't go through with it, how she had gotten attached to me for the few times that she had met be before my mom decided not to put me for adoption. She explained how she decided to adopt another girl instead for years but none of them felt right as she couldn't replace the feelings that she had for me. I was really surprised by all of it.

So my brother does know that he is adopted, but doesn't know about me. She said they planned to tell him on when he became 21 but she thinks he is ready to know. She asked me to give her a week or so and allow them to tell him everything and then we can meet. She had brought a USB drive full of pictures and videos from his childhood until now for me to see. We took a few pictures there for her to show him when they tell him about me. 

Last night my mom and I went through all the pictures and videos, my mom was crying all the time. She was very sad but she also had some happiness because in all those pictures and videos it seems like he is happy and has a very good family who love him very much. I really hope this helps her overcome her sadness and feelings of guilt and regret.

So that's the progress. I'm waiting for her to contact me. 
   
**tl;dr**: I told my mom that I don't blame her for anything and she shouldn't feel guilty. I met with my brother's parents and it went well. He knows he is adopted but doesn't know about me. They wanted to tell him and hopefully we will have the opportunity to meet and get to know each other after that.",1447867154.0,[Update] I just realized that [20F] have a twin brother that my mom never told me about.,0.93

Thank you everyone for all the advice! And thank you to those that also offered to play with me. I wasn't expecting my post to get so many replies. Unfortunately, I had some unrelated family business, so I couldn't respond to you all. However, I have read everything and have taken all your words into consideration. Some people have also asked me questions about how we can play so often, how long I've been with my boyfriend, etc., so I'll just give a brief background (skip to the next line if you don?t want to read it). 

First off, most of us are college students [18/20], either working part time or staying at home with our parents. As of right now, most of us are on summer break. We only have two older members in the group, which are R [25/M] and another guy [23/M]. The rest of us are or fall under 20. R is actually married and his wife makes good bank, so he has a ton of free time. 

Second, about my boyfriend. Surprisingly we met through the gaming group, as he was the one who advertised it, which was how I found and joined the group. That was about 2 years ago, and about a couple of months after we met, we just clicked and started dating. My boyfriend has known R for about 3 years, so they're close friends. However, R did not join the group until 6 months ago, as my boyfriend invited him because he thought it'd be fun to have him there too. I did not know much of R, other than that he was my boyfriend's friend, until he joined the group.

  ---   
So, after I posted my original post, I signed up for 2 different groups. The first one was an all-women?s group [16-20F]. They responded to me pretty quickly. They were very nice and polite, but explained that they only play once/twice a week. Unfortunately, that didn't cut it for me. The second group responded to me the next day, and I learned that they were more active but that they're also an all-men?s group [17-19M]. However, they were open to having me there. At first, I felt pretty sketched, but the oldest and most popular guy [19/M] there took me aside and explained to me that he does not tolerate any type of harassment and that he will definitely kick out any of the other guys if they were bothering me. Hearing that made me feel more comfortable and I played some games with them. I had so much fun! All the guys were really nice and friendly. No sexual remarks, no more screaming of profanity against women, etc.. It was nice being in a group of people who were happy to play with me.

After I finished my games and left, my boyfriend called and asked if we could talk. When he came over, before I could even ask or speak myself, he told me he was really sorry and that he screwed up big time, and he understands how wrong he was. He said he didn't want me to go to a new group because he feared that I would leave him too for some new guy. Then he told me that he didn't realize how hurt I was from being excluded from the group because I had never complained or voiced against it, which was true. I never complained about the exclusions, or even R?s behavior before, because I knew it would just cause more conflict. I also didn't want my boyfriend to stop playing with his friends because of me. I explained this to him, and he said he was sorry for not defending and comforting me like he should have been in the first place. 

To my surprise, he then showed me his text messages between him and R that happened a few months ago. Apparently, way before my exclusion, R had a few conversations with my boyfriend, telling him how much of a pain it was to play with me there. He wanted my boyfriend to kick me out. However, my boyfriend refused and told R that was not happening. Then, around the time when I decided to stop hanging out around R, that's when R sent a group text to everyone in the group explaining how he doesn't want to play with the group again, and he hopes everyone understands. Everyone, and to my shock, even my best friend, all agreed with him. Only my boyfriend protested, but R was really stubborn and he had the whole group to support him, so my boyfriend gave up. After showing me those texts, he told me next that he kicked R from their group earlier today. R was not allowed to play with them anymore, but my boyfriend said he'd still be willing my play with R one on one, but only like once a month. Surprisingly, R agreed, and that was that. My boyfriend said he understood if I didn't want to be with him anymore, but said that he truly does love me.

Honestly, even after all that has happened, I'm not mad at my boyfriend. This is both of ours first relationship, and we?re still learning. He's always been kind to me and I?ve never had a problem with him before this situation occurred.  I feel happy that he realized his mistakes and did apologize without me asking. This is the first time he's ever come across a situation where he has no choice but to choose a side, so I don't blame him for trying to do anything to keep the group together. He told me he would also like me to come back to our old group, but he said it's completely fine if I stay with my new group. He knows it was wrong of him to ask me not to join a new group. I told him I don't think I'll ever come back to the old group and that I will definitely be sticking with my new group from now on. However, I will always make time for him and put him first. He accepted it without any protest, and we went back to our usual fun activities. 

I feel bad that my boyfriend may have lost a close friend since I never asked him to do any of that for me. Regardless, I am happy, and lately my boyfriend and I have been spending more time together now that R isn't around as much. I have also continued playing with my new group and it's been awesome. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading this long update! Sorry for the ramble and mistakes, my mind is all over the place right now and I wanted to explain as much as I could. Thank you guys once again!

Well, thanks for your feedback, guys. Wanted to give you an update.

So something I failed to mention in my last post is that my mom used to teach at my alma mater before she recently retired. She didn't know about my brief relationship with Kevin years ago. After writing my post, I decided to share with her everything that happened.

Mom immediately got this weird look on her face and said she knew exactly who I was talking about because she used to teach in my department. She said, ""I don't think Kevin will be a problem for you."" When I asked why, she said, ""Trust me, you'll see. That guy is kind of a loser.""

So I went to the event, and it was amazing. I took some of the advice here and brought a girlfriend so I would never be alone in case Kevin tried to pull something. I met a bunch of alumni and ran into a couple people who I lost touch with when I got sick. Everybody were thrilled to hear how well I'm doing, and my speech got an ovation when I was done.

Anyway, Kevin showed up with his wife. I don't know how to say this without sounding mean, but he's gotten fat and is going bald. I was surprised at how old he looked until someone told me he's almost 50 now (which means he lied to me when we were dating and said he was younger than he really was). Also, I heard from old classmates that Kevin is **still** studying for his degree, plus working nights as a security guard now.

Kevin was the only person at the event who avoided me. Like, it was obvious. I thought he was going to avoid me all night until I accidentally found myself alone for 30 seconds, which is when he nervously approached me to congratulate me. I smiled, said thanks, and kept moving. He tried cracking a dumb joke to me later but I just ignored him, which seemed to frustrate him. Overall I just spent the night focused on the people around me and forgot he existed.

Interestingly, he managed to repeatedly piss off a bunch of people (including his wife and one of the deans) throughout the night with stupid comments. It got so bad that people started a running joke about what an insensitive moron Kevin was.

I'm so glad I went and didn't allow one jerk from my past to make me hide. I had a great time and was surprised at how unafraid I felt when I saw Kevin again. The memories from that time of my life were so traumatic but now he's just some jackass I once knew. I'm not sure now WTF I ever saw in him or why I was ever scared of him.

Oh, and by the way, I recently started a great new job that came with a big raise, which means I'll have my student loans paid off this year. Life is good. Thanks for your help, Reddit.

  **tl;dr: Ran into asshole ex and realized he can't hurt me. Had a fun time meeting people and ignoring him.**

EDIT: Aw, the comments got locked fast. Two things I wanted to add:

* an acquaintance recently told me that apparently Kevin and his now wife were in an open relationship for a long time (including while he and I were together), and that she closed the relationship again a few years ago because she got annoyed. I can only imagine the shenanigans. I feel better knowing he didn't cheat on her, even though he still cheated on **me**, and of course he didn't tell me about his wife at all. Whatever.

* My favorite part of the evening: I blocked Kevin on Facebook years ago, so he's had NO updates whatsoever on my life including the fact that I go by my birth name now. In college, everybody called me by a nickname, but no one's used it now in years. So all night he kept calling me by this super old nickname. People kept looking at him like he was crazy and asking, ""Why are you calling her that?"", and Kevin got super frustrated because he realized everybody was in on some joke that he didn't understand.

First, I want to thank everybody for the help and many kind words that were sent my way. Seriously, thank you.

I'll start with what happened afterwards, and work my way up to today, and that's the only reason that I'm making an update only a week later.

Emily (my best friend's sister), texted both of them informing them informing that I'd be coming by to get stuff (Emily would be going to my ex-SO's). I went with my best friend (Trevor) and Emily to get some stuff from my apartment, my roommate wasn't there, but he left me a note saying that he's sorry, and attempting to explain the situation. I threw it away (after reading it), grabbed some stuff and loaded it into my car. I drove back to their house while the two of them then went to my ex's apartment to grab my stuff.

My ex was there and at first, she wouldn't let them in. She yelled at them to go away through the door, and after about 15 minutes of them sitting there, she eventually opened up and let them in to collect my things. They grabbed my PS4, movies, cookware, clothes and some random other things. She cried the whole time and asked them if they would tell me that ""she's sorry"", ""it was a one time thing"", ""I would do anything to change it."" They didn't say a word, although she was crying into an older hoodie of mine, so they left that there. I'm not too torn up about that.

I told a few select friends what happened, and asked if they would watch the doors to my classroom when I had classes as I didn't want to cause a scene. Nothing on Wednesday, but she stood outside one of my teaching classes on Thursday. I went in through a different door, and thankfully she didn't see me.

Friday is the day that really upsets me. As I said in the last post (in a reply), I'm an Education Major and I have my practicums this semester. Our Education building has two floors, and the 1st floor is a laboratory school (an elementary school that has a lot of Education students come in and do their practicums, or observations), while the 2nd floor has classrooms for Education students.

My practicum is with 3rd graders, and she stood OUTSIDE the door to my 3rd grade classroom waiting for me (we have name tags, and only have to show those to the desk to get in). She used to be an education major, but switched majors, therefore it wasn't too uncommon for her to be in there. I saw her and my heart immediately sank. I decided to just walk by her and ignore her. She saw me and started crying and trying to talk to me. I didn't say a word, but just walked into the classroom. My cooperating teacher asked her to leave, but all my students that were there had already seen it. They started bombarding me with questions, but I just stuck with, ""It's nothing important right now. We can talk about it later, but we need to focus on our learning right now."" But honestly, it killed me inside. I explained the situation to my cooperating teacher, and asked her to watch out for if she came back again. She said that she would and would ask her to leave if she saw her again.

I received a few text messages this weekend from her (and her roommate - that was extremely annoying), I got an insane amount of phone calls, and I got a ton of Facebook messages. Trevor and Emily also received quite a few as well. I worked all weekend, and threw myself into lesson plans and projects due. I also went and played a round of golf with some friends.

Today is really why I'm updating. I got a text from my ex at around 7.15p. She told me that she was pregnant and that it was mine. I screenshotted the conversation. I'm trying to stay calm, but if she truly is pregnant (and the baby is mine), then that throws a whole wrench into everything.

Can anybody give me some advice on what to do next? I'm trying to remain as calm as I can, but this is really big and I'm starting to freak out.

Thank you all!

Here's the text conversation:

*Her: I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry that I messed up our future, but I think that we just got a second chance. I know that this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm pregnant. Maybe this is why I made my mistake.*

*Me: You can't use a pregnancy to explain cheating, it doesn't work like that. I want a pregnancy test. Not one from the store, but to actually go to the doctor and have them do that. If it turns out that you are pregnant, then I want a paternity test.*

*Her: Fine. I'll call the doctor tomorrow and set up an appointment. But if I am pregnant, can we have a second chance?*

*Me: No. All I want to know from you is when and where the appointment is.*

She seems to calm for this to this to just be a joke. She's been bat-shit crazy for almost the past week, and now she's extremely calm. I'm honestly extremely scared.

371,grootius,Relationships,bhl2z6,2532,"I have no friends or family so I created an account to ask for help. 

My wife and I have been together for 5 years married for 4, she had a bad marriage before me and had a child. I had no problem stepping up to the plate to help her raise her child (the father wants nothing to do with my wife or his kid)

To the point, I had 2 friends that I've had since I was 16, they were both female and I had dated one of them for 4 years but we split up agreeing that we made better friends then an actual couple. Which never happens in real life apparently. Shes always been my go for advice and I made our friendship 100% transparent for my wife when we first met and never hid anything. Out of habit my friend and I still said we loved each other but more if a platonic love. We both loved our current partners and never wanted anything between each other. However after a few years this took a toll on my wife and she asked me to stop telling her that I loved her. So I explained this to my friend and she said she understood and would have no problem doing so. 

Another month or so I still have 100% transparency with my wife as to make her feel comfortable. I got deployed and my friend had just had her baby and asked me if I wanted to facetime to see her. I said yes naturally happy for her and her husband. After a nice chat and meeting her new son. I got a call from my wife a few days later asking if I had talked to her kn facetime. I told her that I had and why, also telling her what we had discussed. My wife then didnt talk to me the rest of my deployment. When I got home I explained that I was sorry it hurt her feelings and wanted to make things better. She told me to never talk to her again. I tried to explain that its was just a friendship and that neither of us wanted a relationship. 

My wife took it upon herself to call her and tell her that if she didnt stop talking to me forever that she would tell my friends husband that we were having an affair.

She did not tell me any of this. I quickly noticed she had blocked me on everything, including my number. I had no idea what happened so I confronted my wife and she told me that she was certain I was cheating on her and that my friend and I were having an affair. She then told me that she had called her and only asked her to not talk to me anymore. I was slightly upset but stood by her decision and held no grudge. 

I feel like this event led to the breakdown of everything. She started to have no trust in anything I did, constantly going through my phone, and she would constantly lock her phone, or lock herself in the bathroom talking to someone on the phone. 

She started blaming her job for her unhappiness, I told her that I could pull extra hours at work if she wanted to quit to find a new one. She quickly quit her job and made no attempt to find work agajn.

I was enlisted at the time. She said she hated that I was gone all the time so I offered to go reserves to be with her more. She said that would fix it. So I got a civilian job that paid decent but we had to move. 

The job is stressful and I'm not very fond of being a civilian. She has now come to the conclusion that I need to get out of the military and quit my civilian job and we to move again and that's the only way she'll be happy. 

I feel like I've given up everything for her to be happy, I'm trying to show her the logic that there is no way for us to survive if neither of us work.

I love my wife and dont want a divorce but I feel like she will never be happy and I'm not sure how to fix it. She blames everything on me and says that I'd be happier with someone else or says shes leaving again.

I'm currently deployed again and the last week I was home she wouldn't talk to me or spend time with me and our daughter. She would lock herself in the bedroom all day. Then at night she would call me names and say I dont care about her and I never spend time with her. 

Im very confused because I'm not the best with emotions, I'm a logical man and I see no logical answer here.

Any thoughts or advice would be great. Thank you!

&#x200B;

After reading through everyone's responses and taking time for myself to see how I really felt about the whole situation, I did as I said I was going to do, and blocked my sister on all forms of social media. I also cut her out of my life (albeit, temporarily). For about 8 months, I didn't speak to her, nor make any attempts at communicating with her.  That summer (so about 2 months after I had stopped contact with her), my sister moved away for school. My mother eventually got wind of the situation from my brother (who was 24 at the time and has never been particularly close with our younger sister) and asked me why I wasn't talking to my sister.

Initially she was judgmental, but after explaining to her my sisters repeated behavior of posting personal details about me online (including my phone number and details about my sex life), my mother was furious and agreed that I had every right to cut her out of my life. At one point, my mother, during a phone conversation with my sister, called her out, calling my sister childish, petty, and vindictive and said that if she ever found out that she was posting any intimate details about ANY family members online like that again, she wouldn't hesitate to find a lawyer. She also threatened to kick my sister out of the house if she didn't stop her nonsense (while she was away at school, she did live at my mom's house during summer breaks/holidays).  I'm not sure if there was any actual legal repercussions my mom could have actually made against her, but it was enough to make my sister set her blog/twitter to private after my mom browbeat her into submission for being so shitty.  Due to this, my sister and my mom had a huge falling out as well, with my sister repeating the same old adage of how it was her ""personal"" blog/twitter so she could do whatever she wanted with it/on it.

Christmas rolled around and me and sister still weren't talking, and while my mom had patched things up with her to a degree, it was an awkward holiday. Me and my brother both live independently. When we went over to visit for holiday stuff, were civil and polite towards our sister, but we never failed to notice her on her phone 24/7. We could only speculate what she was doing, but I was less bothered now that she had set her blogs to private. Regardless, during a dinner at one point, she was on her phone and my mom asked her to put her phone down so we could have ""family"" time. She responded along the lines of ""yeah, one minute"", and my brother made a jab about how she was probably too busy posting ""bullshit lies"" about us on the internet. I should mention that while my sister doesn't seem to care what I think/ask of her, she has always seemed to respond and care about what my brother thinks. She tried to fight him on his comment for a minute, but he shut her down, calling her ""a fucking child"" who just wants ""internet points"" and straight up said that if she was "" a decent fucking human being"" she would talk to us about her problems instead of cowering behind a screen.  She shut up after that and retreated to her room after dinner was done.

After Christmas, I continued to have zero contact with her. I would hear about how she was doing in school via our mom from time to time, but still had her blocked on all social media. She came home for the summer to work, and that summer our Grandma (my deceased father's mother ) died. My sister ended up having a complete breakdown due to the culminating and unworked through grief surrounding our father (who had died 2 years previous) and now our Grandma. She started going to therapy and actually taking her medication.

Eventually, she reached out and apologized to me about her behavior the past few years. We had a sit down that fall, over some beers and talked about everything that had happened and her behavior. I told her while I accepted her apology, it would take some time for me to work through her how behavior had affected me and our relationship. I unblocked her on FB so we could make a group chat with our brother as a buffer. We now occasionally talk, but we still aren't as close as we used to be when we were younger. I actually went to lunch with her the last time she was in town and it felt...okay. So that's it, here we are.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Blocked my sister on all forms of social media and cut contact, only participating in it during holiday events/funerals.

Hi everyone! 

I am incredibly thankful for everyone?s comments and suggestions. Since my first post, things took a bit of a turn from her progress, but today she is back to 30 days sober!We have not proceeded with rehab, but here?s what has happened since then. 

2 weeks after my first post, my daughter came home from her work and asked me if she could borrow the health savings card and pick up her medication the next day. I said no, I would get it for her myself as I usually do. She protested for a minute or so but I was firm. She left it at that. 

For the rest of the night she was unusually quiet. She?s usually quite talkative with her grandparents who live with us, or myself and her sister. Not that night. This was slightly concerning, but I didn?t raise any questions. 

Fast forward to around midnight, my daughter came to me and spilled A LOT of details about her drug past. It was a lot of information to take in at one time, and finally she got to the point that she relapsed and needed the health savings card to get detoxed. After my momentary shock passed, I told her that I loved her and that I would go with her to the detox center, and that she didn?t need to hide things from me. I didn?t tell her about how I found out she?s already in meetings, I figured that could be my little secret or it can emerge when the time is right. 

After that, she got detoxed and all was well for a while before she relapsed again. She was much more straight-forward about it that time, and since that detox, everything has been going smooth. She is back into counseling and takes a 4-day a week class for getting her high school diploma. Today she is 30 days sober and is celebrating her sobriety / birthday with some friends. 

I appreciate every single comment! Thank you everyone for their kind words and advice. I feel good about the approach I took, although I would go back and change some things, she is getting the help she needs and we have a more open line of communication. She is more lively, is getting back into her passions, and is much, much happier. I?m still feeling guilty that I didn?t pick up the signs of addiction soon enough, but she assured me she has forgiven me and that I don?t need to worry about it at all. 

Happy ending! Thank you everyone!

Sorry I haven't been able to update sooner.

My husband actually approached me about this before I had a moment to talk to him. I've been a mess, to be honest. But you all are right, I know I have to cut my father in law out of my life, regardless of the cost. Thankfully, my husband had come to the same conclusion. We talked, and I cried, and he cried, and we agreed it would only hurt our daughter and our future other children to keep this man in our lives. 

We contacted my MIL, and she is aware of our stance. We are officially no contact with my FIL, and if he shows up at the house, we will call the police and pursue prosecution. We're still considering filing a police report about what happened at the hospital.

Some clarification, because I have stupid sleep deprived brain and have a hard time writing, and have been getting pretty serious hate mail over this bit of bad writing: No, husband and I would not have aborted a boy. My FIL accused us of that but that is not and would never have been the case.

He's everything I want in a man and I love him dearly.

Anyways, yesterday while he was out, I was transferring some photos from a recent vacation we had taken onto my laptop. Some of the photos were on his laptop, so I decided to go onto his laptop and quickly get the photos onto a USB to transfer onto mine. When I went on his laptop, I saw that he had FB open, and also noticed that he was messaging my sister. I found this kinda strange, I mean they're not really that close and don't talk to one another unless we're at a family event. 

So I open up the message box, and it shows a lot of messages between the two. In them, it contains a ton of dirty texts, nudes, and messages to meet up. I was absolutely shocked when I saw this. It turns out whenever he tells me ""I'm going out with the boys"", he's really been fucking my sister. He hadn't shown any signs of being unhappy or cheating, I mean we're getting married in two months for gods sakes! And my sister, our entire lives we've been so close to one another. She's the one who I rant to, spill all my secrets, get advice and support from, she even helped my fiancee propose to me! I just can't believe they would do this to me.

tldr of that was that my boyfriend burped during grace and refused to apologize.

First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to that post I made, I got a lot more responses than I thought I would! And that really made me see how in the wrong kevin was. 

Kevin and I broke up right after that incident. It made me realize a lot of things about our relationship that I guess I wasn't seeing clearly before. He really was arrogant and manipulative. He had this way of saying things that made it sound like he was right 100% of the time and that anything I said was stupid. It wasn't until after I read all of the comments that overwhelmingly said he was in the wrong that I realized just how manipulative he was. Maybe I should mention that kevin was really hot, like REALLY HOT so maybe thats why I didn't realize how much of an ass he was until way later lol.

Anyway, this isn't so much of an update as to our relationship, it's a funny story I heard. I've been working a summer job for the past while now in my hometown where both kevin and I live. It's not a tiny town where everyone knows each other but its not huge either. Anyway at work I was talking with some of my coworkers on break and the conversation of terrible exes came up. The story that my one coworker decided to share was about... you guessed it... kevin.

Apparently they dated about a year ago. my coworker (lets call her (brenda) had to go to her cousins wedding and kevin was her plus one. During the ceremony, kevin got really bored, and he decided to let everyone know. Apparently he started saying stuff like ""oh my god this is taking so long"" and ""is it almost over yet?"" and he kept going on and on. He wasn't so loud that everyone could hear him but the people around him definitely could, brenda said a lot of people were turning their heads to look at them, she was super embarrassed. Apparently they got in a huge fight between the ceremony and reception and that was the end of their relationship. LOL I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that story. Sounds exactly like something kevin would do.

Anyway thats it for my update. Things are going well for me, I'm currently enjoying single life. Just working and hanging out with friends. One of the things that kevin said that really bothered me was that religion never does anything good. That really bothered me so I started volunteering with a  charity that my church helps run once a week, just organizing stuff thats been donated. Maybe I let him get to me but it feels good to help out. I dont hold anything against atheists, you guys totally convinced me that the problem was kevin and that many atheists are cool.

I have received several pm?s asking me to update. A bit has happened since then, but I will try to be brief to avoid a wall of boring text. 

So I told my mom and brother like everyone suggested. My mom was heartbroken, and we talked for a few hours. She told me she was not surprised. When they were married she suspected him of having inappropriate contact with students. My dad is a handsome man and she told me many girls would give him that kind of attention. She did not know if he was unfaithful for certain though. My brother took it as I expected. He blamed my ex and told me I should date less slutty women. I feel like this is missing the point but whatever. I can?t stand that guy anyway. 

For the following week after I dumped my ex, she would call and text me a lot. The gist was basically she loved me and I should forgive her because she made a mistake but hates herself for it. She told me it was just sex and that she wanted to fulfill her fantasy of having sex with an older male teacher before we got married. I didn?t respond to any of these messages or return her calls.

I hadn?t heard from my dad until a few days ago when he came by to reconcile. He let himself in as he has a key and we talked. He told me about how the affair started with them flirting a little. Eventually they had sex. He said while they had sex three times, only the last time was actual penetrative sex. The first two she just blew him apparently and he fingered her. He told me this like I was going to be relieved they only did it once. In reality I was horrified that now a detailed picture was in my mind. 

I asked him if he had been in contact with my ex. He said yes and that they have had dinner a few times as friends because he was worried about her. According to my ex, I was emotionally torturing her, and my dad believes he is responsible for her. I told him I would not have a relationship with him ever if he kept in contact with her. He said I was his son and that he would be in my life regardless. I just held my tongue. He then told me it was shitty to tell my mom and brother like I was trying to ruin his reputation. I was done so I just nodded and apologized. I know that was cowardly, but I didn?t want an argument.

That was a few days ago. I haven?t told anyone else other than my immediate family. I still don?t know whether to totally cut contact with my dad. Part of me does, part of me doesn?t. 

**tldr: Told my family, broke up with my gf, dad came over to reconcile. I still don't know what to do.**

edit: People are concerned with me apologizing. I do not actually feel remorse, I told him that because it is what he wanted to hear and I wanted him to leave. At that point I was just nodding along to avoid an argument and him potentially staying longer. Also I should have asked for the key, but like someone said here it is difficult for me to face him so I admit I wasn't thinking straight.

379,evildreamcrusher,Non-Romantic,52g7ev,2522,"I recently won an all-expense paid trip to Disney World for four nights, for myself and three guests. I am currently planning on bringing my boyfriend [30M] , my mother [54F], and my boyfriend's mother [50sF]. I know we all aren't exactly Disney's key demographic, but it honestly means a lot to our mothers that I am inviting them. Both my boyfriend and I grew up in poorer families that could never afford expensive vacations, and this is the first trip to Disney World for all of us. I know this is probably the only opportunity our mothers will ever have to go to Disney, and for now they are both in good enough health to still enjoy the rides.


The problem is with my cousin, Jane [30F], who has been hounding me to take her 5-year-old daughter, Kelly, instead of my boyfriend's mother. I know, I know, what kind of monster am I for not wanting to bring a little girl to the place where dreams come true?! Except Jane's family has already been to Disney World twice, most recently earlier this year in February. My cousin has done very well for herself - she runs a successful photography business, and her husband is an engineer. They are definitely able to afford their own vacations. If Jane wasn't so well off, I probably would consider taking Kelly if I thought I was giving a little kid a once in a lifetime experience. But I'm not. She's already been twice and she's only five! Our mothers have been ZERO times. Jane's only rationale for wanting me to take her daughter seems to be that ""Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults."" and ""It'd be evil to not take a 5 year old to Disney if you had the chance."" 


There's also the issue of Kelly herself. She's not a completely terrible child, but she's whiny and throws tantrums regularly. I don't really want to spend a week with that. Also, what if she gets homesick, what if she gets actually sick, what if she gets lost?! I'm not a parent myself and I would have no idea what to do in those situations. I also don't want to saddle my mother with the responsibility of caring for her. I've babysat Kelly before, but only for a few hours at a time. I'm not sure why my cousin is even comfortable with the idea of me taking her child three states away.  We are in North Carolina, so it's not like Orlando is just a short drive down the road if something happens. 


I tried telling Jane I'm not comfortable bringing Kelly, and she just said this is a good opportunity to find out what being a parent is like. What?! She's almost acting like I'm not serious about not bringing Kelly, and I'm just pretending I don't want to bring her. It's really weird. Jane and I have always been very close, like we are sisters, and I'm afraid this has the potential to ruin our relationship once it comes to a head. What is the best way to tell her no without sounding like an evil child hater, or am I being selfish for not taking a kid to Disney?

Thanks everyone that sent me condolences about my mom. It's been really hard these past several days but I've been hanging in there okay. 

I tried being reasonable to John about he wanted to handle things...I even told him like one poster here suggested that he didn't have to go to the service, but could wait in the lobby with my daughter while the service was on going, then she could spend time with my family after the service, but he again, shot it down. He would be able to hear the service and that was ""a violation of his beliefs and asking to compromise on those beliefs was unconscionable and unfair to our daughter"". 

I told him I had had it. This is the icing on a very large cake. I told John that as of this week, I wanted our bank account separated (he made us join accounts to make sure we split everything equally to be fair despite ME making more) and that I'd be staying with my brother after the funeral while we figured out what to do wether that was a total breakup or counseling. It was up to him. He said counseling was for ""the weak minded"" and that we were staying together despite my ""empty threats"" and there was no way in fuck he was letting me take his money. He became very loud and in my face during this conversation so I just let him throw his tantrum until he took my silence as agreement.  

I took my daughter with me to the viewing with no problems. John and I barely spoke that day, which was fine by me. But it hit the fan the next day....when I got up in the morning to get myself ready and get my daughter ready, I discovered that he had the motherfucking gall to PARK HIS CAR DIRECTLY BEHIND MINE, blocking me into the driveway.  I had no way to get to the funeral in my own car. John ALWAYS drives to work, but for reasons I can only image were to get back at me, decided to take the metro, and took the baby carriage and bottles, and my pump with him. 

My brother and I have our differences, granted, in fact we haven't talked much since my mom and I were estranged (we started talking again after she was sick), but he'll forever be a saint to me for what he did. I called him crying, and he and my sister in law arrived within 20 minutes. SIL calmed me down and helped me get my daughter ready, and they brought along spare bottles, a carrier, and a breast pump. Thanks to them I was able to go my mom's funeral in comfort, and my daughter was an angel during the service. They calmed me down and everything went perfectly, and even though I was a mess most of the day, having my daughter with me, and my SIL and even my brother with me to lean on gave me peace on the inside. 

I've made up my mind not to tolerate John's insane and controlling behavior anymore. He had a litany of excuses for doing what he did (he even tried to claim his car had problems) and I don't want to hear any of them. I never wanted to be a single mom...I always wanted to raise my baby within a family. But I've decided that going alone is so much better than doing it with this man, who thought nothing of trying to kick me while I was down. My brother's arranged for me to talk to a friend of his that specializes in family law this week, and we're taking it from there. 

I still feel so guilty for what happened with my mom...I miss her so much. I hope from here on out I can make her proud of me, despite my mistakes.

381,cheatingfriendhelp,Updates,7ithzl,2513,"I decided to post an update even though the OP didn't get too much attention. Can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6bfrr9/me_23f_with_my_friend_23f_she_cheated_on_her/).

The TL;DR of the OP is basically this: My friend Sarah cheated on her boyfriend James, who happens to be my friend, too. She didn't want to tell him because he'd likely end the relationship and they had a big trip planned. I didn't know if I should tell him (my gut told me yes, definitely) or stay out of it.

After I posted here Sarah decided to tell James parts of the truth and told me to stay out of it. I decided not to do that since he deserved the whole truth. 

I wanted to tell him in person but he couldn't meet up because he was at a family gathering or something like it, I don't remember. He called and asked me what I wanted to meet up for and I told him the whole truth. That she cheated on him with her best friend, that she didn't tell him everything that happened, etc. I was worried she got to him somehow and that he wouldn't believe me, but he thankfully did. I still send him every text I had of her, which was probably incredibly helpful. 

While I was talking to him she sorta knew what was happening and drove over to his place immediately. When she got there he hung up and they talked. She tried to weasel her way out of it but since he had her texts that didn't work out too well. 

Before she came over he told me this was the last straw, especially since she lied to him about it and made out with said friend once before. I don't know what she did or what she said, but he did a complete 180 and suddenly he was okay with it. 

I've only talked to him twice since then and he told me that it's not such a big deal and they'd get over it.

They've completely cut me out of their lives, when I asked him why he said he wanted to wait until his girlfriend and I had a talk and could get along again - which isn't happening, since I don't want to be friends with her anymore. 

It sucks that I've lost my two best friends even though I wasn't even the one who fucked up, but at least I can sleep normally again.

382,Iamjusttryingtohalp,Relationships,3t2ext,2504,"We've been together 7 months, and are planning to move in together in January. Since last week she has had a pretty nasty bout with the flu, and yesterday it finally caused her to regurgitate and defecate on herself and her bed.

I heard it occur, and heard her sobs afterwards, so I went in and carried her to her bath. I ran a warm bath and cleaned her up(I had seen her entire body at this point anyways), and left her wrapped in a blanket on the couch. I took her bedding to the laundromat and got all of that cleaned, and scrubbed her comforter and left it outside to dry. I thought nothing of it at all, you help those you care about when they need it.

I work nights, so I left her that evening.  When I woke up today, I came over and found her locked in her room, upset that I saw her like that and did what I did. She says I saw her in a way she never wanted me to see, and she can't handle that.

Did I overstep a boundary? I am sitting on the couch right now and can't really get her to talk to me, she just says she can't face me. I've always been of the mind that when people are sick you help them, and cleaning someone who had an accident isn't really a big thing to me. Was I supposed to just leave her in her fluids?

   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend was sick, had hygiene issues, I cleaned, she is upset I saw her that way.


**Edit:** About an hour ago she texted me to come to the door. We started talking through the door. She finally said that she was just afraid that I wouldn't see her as attractive(What a number of you guys said) and she was really embarrassed. I told her that is is just a natural part of being alive, and that I thought no less of her and she is still my Lynx(my nickname for her). I told her she needs to see the doctor, which she has agreed tomorrow, so after work I will take her. She opened the door hugged me, thanked me, said she loved me, then shut it and said she was going to bed. I am going to head back to my place and take a nap before I head to work.

383,handsomehubby12,Relationships,8vif0o,2489,"My husband 'Sean' has always been a huge fitness and gym enthusiast. He is extremely good looking and always has multiple women flirting/hitting on him and this has always been a big insecurity of mine so maybe that's why I am so paranoid.

Recently about 7 months ago a new couple 'Dylan and Flora' moved into our area. They are both 23 and out of college. Flora and my husband met while playing tennis as they both go to the same club and they get along great. I always thought she had a crush on him but as she is(was?) respectful, so I left it at that. Soon my husband invited her to the Gym he goes.

Now, a week ago I get a call from Dylan saying that one of the guys in the Gym had seen my husband and Flora kissing just outside our apartment building. He also gave me three instances when Flora was out and asked whether I could account for my husband. I said I?d call him back so I could check my calendar. I?d been with him all three times. When I called back he said she had condoms in the glove-box of her car and she?d been checking out hotel sites. She?s also very secretive about her phone now. 

I went through his phone and social media as we are very open about these things and there was no sign of an affair although they had been texting quite a bit(about tennis etc.) and she has always been very complimentary but my husband has not responded/flirted back. It sounds like Flora is up to something but I pray to God it?s not with my husband. So why phone me? We have very loving relationship and he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who would cheat.

Even worse, the guy called me again last night asking that I go on some sort of stake-out with him. She says she?s away with work next week and he?s sure it?s not true. He?s hoping to catch her at it. 

Should I go too and keep everything crossed it?s not my husband? Should I just confront my husband or just lay low and hope for the best. This is tearing me apart now and I have not been able to sleep since.

384,Solis_C,Non-Romantic,abf4io,2487,"So I currently work almost 40 hours a week at a job I absolutely despise. Right before the year ended, I realized that I want to go to university and pursue higher education because I really don't want to be working retail for the rest of my life. I would have gone earlier, but had no idea what I wanted to do and also suffered from anxiety/depression for a quite a while. The problem is that this job I have right now isn't flexible and impossible to hold onto while at university. Not to mention that I don't want to work 40 (5 days a week) hours a week, just to attend 40 hours of classes + study. I really want to get good grades and it's not going to happen if I'm stretched completely thin.


Not to mention that this current job I'm at is wearing down on me physically, mentally and emotionally:
* I'm constantly being relied on far too much and given an extra work load for no benefit on my own because 99% of the people there don't work hard, don't show up and can't be fired (because they're desperate and need people)
* I can't speak up about it or ask for a lighter load because the regional manager has already threatened people's jobs for working too slow
* Due to the repetitive nature of the job, I'm already developing wrist and knee problems
* The place is cloaked in dust and giving me severe allergy problems
* There's no air conditioning and we're still expected to work hard, even during severe heatwaves
* Constant micromanagement from a new manager that's pushing a lot of people to look for another job as wel

So this pushed me to find another job, which luckily, I landed and in 3 weeks time will start. The job pays far better and even though I'll be working less hours than I am now, I'll basically earn the same amount (and I don't spend much money, so when I earn less, I'll be fine), with the extra benefit of it being 5 minutes away from where I live and for far less effort. When I told my parents, my mother was completely fine with it because she knows I hate it there and need the extra time, however my father had the complete opposite reaction. Even though I explained that the pay, conditions, hours and free-time will be much better for me, he claims I **NEED** to be working 40 hours a week, otherwise I'm ""being lazy"" and that ""everyone needs to be working 40 hours a week, otherwise they're lazy"" (he works 50+ hours a week and only gets one day off a week). In his mind, all I'll be doing is sitting at home playing video games and ""not contributing to society"", even though I'll barely have time to play games no and in the future.

What's the best way to approach this issue? Keep in mind that ""move out"" is NOT helpful advice and that I know I won't be getting kicked out or anything for this either. I also do want to point out that we don't have financial problems either, so that isn't the cause either.

TL;DR - My dad has a problem with me working a job that I'll generally be getting paid more for all while I work less hours and have less stress.

**EDIT: Now my mother is on his side and thinks I should turn down the new job? She thinks that I ""need to be a man"" and work the long hours. How toxic.**

**tl;dr -** found texts that suggested my bf had sex with my own mum, i dont know what to do now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So after having some time to think about the situation, I decided that if my mum and my BF were sympathetic about their actions, I could forgive them and move on with them in my life.

Just kidding :)

First of all I want to thank all of you for your extremely kind and reinforcing replies. I read every single one of them and (although some were... interesting) I never expected to receive such amazing support and encouragement from strangers all over the world. I also received dozens of PMs, with some even offering me a place to stay or simply someone to rant to. I can't thank you all enough, you made me see that I will be okay after all of this is said and done, and for that, /r/relationships, you have my eternal gratitude. (Also thanks to the guy that asked if I was interested in a threesome, appreciate it). 

A fair bit has happened since I put up my post a couple of days ago, but I'll try to keep it as brief as I can. After 3-4 hours of reading your replies, I decided that I'd drive home and grab some essential items before my BF got home from work, and stay a few nights at our local motel. A few of you suggested that the texts I saw may have not been from my mother, but I'm 99% sure that the pictures I saw in the texts were of her (plus I was far too scared to face my BF or mum to double check). 

By the time I got home it was getting fairly late so I tried to grab what I could before my BF arrived. Unfortunately, as I was looking for my laptop I heard his car pull into our driveway. At this point I practically just grabbed what I could and tried to get the hell out of there - I really did not want to see him ever again. I got down the stairs and he opened the door. I'm not really sure what happened, I just started bawling my eyes and screaming, harder than I had been all day, and booked it for the door. He stopped me as I was trying to get past, but I told him to leave me alone and that I'd be back later that night. He did, surprisingly, and I got in my car and drove off.

I mentioned in some comments in my last post that I was sort of friends with the lady who owned our local motel. I was good friends with her sister when we went to high school, and I was sure that after I explained myself she could get me a room to spend a few nights in. I pulled over and rung her up, and whilst trying to convey to her what happened I just started crying hysterically. She went above and beyond what I ever expected anyone would. She offered me a room in her own house for free, and told me I could take as long as I needed. Since then I've basically gone between sleeping and crying, and only left my room to eat and go to the toilet. I am in extreme gratitude to her though, the support I've received in general over the past 2 days has been staggering. 

I turned off my phone last night but I know my BF was blowing it up. I didn't look at any messages or missed calls, but I saw that the notifications were there when I went to turn it off. He'll have no idea that I'm here though, so I guess it's nice to know that I can take a little while to recover without him finding me. 

I didn't mention this earlier, but my BF was the only one on our lease. I'm currently unemployed whilst he has a fairly well-paying job, so hopefully that'll make everything a little easier. As for my mum, I'm pretty much done with her. I plan to move across the country to find a job interstate once I've gotten all of my stuff, and basically never talk to either of them again.

As I said, I still need to get all of my belongings from my BF's place, which is going to be tricky without seeing him. I'm not sure how to go about that and I guess I'm looking for suggestions.

As for me, I'm doing okay. Right now I still can't believe any of this is happening. Sleep is my only source of comfort right now as it allows me to forget all of this is going on, but when I'm awake I can't shake the feeling of dread and constant sickness. But, again, all of you gave me the strength to know that this will get better, it just can't come soon enough.

Again, thank you all so much for your words of encouragement. Hopefully I can get my stuff with no troubles or dramas, and update you all when I begin my new life (without my mum and my ex).

Love you all <3

Throwaway for obvious reasons. First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend.

&#x200B;

I met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.

&#x200B;

This last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a ""what happens in X, stays in X"" type event.

&#x200B;

It was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.

&#x200B;

The following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.

&#x200B;

Yesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were ""I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you"". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.

&#x200B;

She turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.

I woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.

Because I was always on my way to work I never really got to know him too well. But 5 days a week for 6 years he would try his best English and I would do my best Spanish and we'd say hi, how are you, talk about the weather or recent holiday etc.

Obviously we weren't super close and I didn't even know his name until recently. But he always got my day off to a good start and I always missed him on the days he wasn't there. One time it was very hot and I collapsed coming out of the station and he bought me a water and called me a cab. I will really miss our morning greetings.

Well he wasn't around for 2 weeks, which is the longest he's ever been gone so I went inside the coffee shop he's always in front of and asked about him and they told me he passed away. Apparently he had been very sick and just passed over the weekend. They're holding his funeral tomorrow and I think I'd like to go. 

None of his friends and family are going to know who the fuck I am, so I'm not sure if it's appropriate. I don't want to be a distraction on their day of remembrance. I also worry because the service is in a Spanish language church in the Hispanic neighborhood and It's very likely **someone** will speak English, but I worry I won't be able to explain who I am and what this old man meant to me.

I'm having an annoying problem with my daughter's teacher, Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Jones told the students to write a report and do a presentation on their family ancestry and culture. Our family is from various Eastern European countries. However, we are Ashkenazi Jews, so we aren't the same as other people from Eastern Europe. Our ancestors spoke Yiddish first, and Polish/Russian/etc second, and had different customs. My daughter knows this, so she decided to write about Ashkenazi culture. For her poster, instead of drawing pictures of the countries we came from, she drew Eastern Europe with a Jewish star over it.


After she turned it in, I got a message from her teacher that she would have to redo it! Apparently, the assignment was done incorrectly since it didn't focus on the particular countries in general. The assignment didn't say they needed to pick a country, it said they needed to write about their family's culture. I tried to explain to the teacher that doing a report on Poland or Russia didn't make sense since we weren't really Polish or Russian and didn't follow any customs, but she kept insisting that the report had to focus on the countries. She said that my daughter could do her report on Israel instead, if she wanted to focus on her Jewish heritage. That doesn't make sense either, since we can't trace our ancestry to Israel and don't follow any Israeli customs.


I know this sounds like it's not that big of a deal, but I'm really annoyed at this teacher for being so stubborn. Sure, she could absolutely insist that my daughter write about Russia, Poland, and Romania in general, but the assignment was supposed to be about your own culture, not someone else's, so the assignment would be pointless.


I'm trying to write a message to the teacher to explain clearly why my daughter's presentation fulfilled the assignment and should be accepted and graded fairly. I don't want to come off too strong, but I need her to understand why insisting on writing about these countries so generally isn't necessarily appropriate for ethnic minorities.

When I was 20 I had a girlfriend from high school we had been together for 5 years. She ended up getting pregnant and, wanted to get married being young and stupid I agreed.

We got engaged and, I was so happy until the baby was born he came out mixed(not to be racist). I didn't sign the birth certificate and, I questioned her right there in her hospital room.

Long story short she had been sleeping with her boss it started when she was 17 he's 45 now. She cried and tried to convince me we could still be a family and, that she'd spend her life making it up to me.

After much talking I took the ring from her (had to pry it from her hand) and left. It's been 7-8 years since than and, I've met a wonderful woman and I've told her about my past.

We recently just had a baby girl (she's adorable) and, I'm really happy although I was a bit nervous signing the birth certificate. We got home a week ago and she gave me something and, told me she loves me and hopes it will make me feel at ease.

It was DNA results but I don't understand why she would do this though. She knows I trust her and, I never suspected she was cheating or anything.

Should I open it should I just leave it what should I do?

Thank you all for your help and support with my first post. I had never had those types of conversations before. You all really helped me understand my feelings towards Gerad more clearly. 

I talked to Gerad the next day about my feelings. I told him first that I was confused about my sexuality. He was of course very awesome about this. His warmness with that helped me come out and admit my feelings for him. I told him that I had never had these kind of feelings for someone before, girl or guy, and that I was scared since he is my first major friend; I didn't want to hurt what we had. 

I know many people suggested that I not tell him the whole thing, but I saw a chance to get it all off of my chest, and I had to take it. He handled it well, and it didn't seem to have come as a surprise to him. He said that he didn't think it would be good for us at that point in our relationship, which did not feel great to hear, but was also a bit of a relief. He did hug me super close and tight. That was perfect. 

We did not talk about again until last Tuesday. Our school break has been the past week. I couldn't go home because of a hurricane and flooding, so I went with Gerad to him family's home. I am surprised my parents would let me stay at a friend's place over break, but they are busy with some flooding. I got to meet his family and friends, and we spent a lot of time alone together. He took me dancing Tuesday because I made him promise to get me out of my comfort zone. I had never been dancing before. He was extra flirty with me during the night, and we were very close all night. When we got back to his house he made a move and tried to sleep with me. This really freaked me out. 

I let him know that I had an amazing night, the best night of my life, but that I am totally not ready to have sex with anyone. Just the dancing and the kisses on the cheek we shared that night were the most intimate things I had ever done. He was really sorry for coming on so strong. I was worried that I ruined the night for him, but he assured me he still had a great night. We stayed up pretty late talking. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and let me know that we can go as slow as I need to. So, we are together now. I kissed him very quickly today, and it was the best thing ever. 

Also, everyone suggested that I look into therapy and I have had two appointments with a counselor at school. She is really helpful. Thank you for insisting on that. I think she will help me through some of my issues. 

I have not talked about this with my parents yet, and I don't plan to anytime soon. They will be cruel. I don't need that stress right now. 

TL/DR: I told my friend how I felt. We are dating now, which is wonderful. I am seeing a counselor at school.

After posting, I had another talk with my husband. I was very clear that working out was to benefit my health and be a better Mother. I told him how I felt frustrated and tempted quit since my weight loss through diet only had stalled, and how much I really wanted to get into shape. 

He really listened, and not only supported me working out, but decided to drop the sugary drinks and excessive fruits and potatoes and go full keto with me! This has made my dinner preparations so much easier! 

Since his switch to Keto, he's lost 30 lbs, sleeps better, works harder, doesn't get frustrated with the kids as easily, and our sex life is better now than it ever has been. It used to be that before, he rarely wanted to go out and do activities with the kids and I, now he gets so excited to go and participates so much more!

Changing our diets seems to have jump started other projects in our lives as well. On New Years Day, we rounded up everything we haven't used in awhile and donated about half, and put half away for a garage sale in the summer. We made a 2 year plan to live ultra frugally while saving for our forever home.  I've picked up a few extra nights of business during the week since the price of gas has dropped. The extra income helps so much. I hope it stays down awhile while we are saving! (Wishful thinking!)

I've been going to the gym after we put the kids to bed a few nights a week, and I feel amazing! I've had a bad back for years, but weight training is changing that! I love to feel my heart pounding and blood flowing while doing my cardio. Then I go home and my sweet quiet introvert husband has had an hour or so to himself and feels re-charged and misses me. Not only that, but i hadn't realized how much I had been ignoring my own needs. Those couple of hours alone each week do more than get my body back into shape, I feel such relief mentally to have just a little time to myself. My own music, my own workouts, my alone and get healthy time. The amount of energy I am feeling these days is amazing, my house is always clean, my clients are raving about my services, my 5 year old told me the other day how much fun Mommy is now that I'm not tired all the time.

 I've hit 70lbs down, and I'm this/close to breaking 200 lbs for the first time in over a decade. I feel like with my husband's support, nothing can stop us! I've never felt so motivated to reach a goal in all my life. I still went to the gym this week even though I rolled my ankle, AND it was -9* outside.  You can't stop this train! **CHOO-CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS!**

We are looking forward to Spring and all the outdoor activities we will be doing with our kiddos.

I really appreciate all the great advice and support this subreddit gave to me. Thank you all so much!

Original post TL;DR I'm at the bottom of the list for my wife and its driving me nuts.*

Sorry, long. 

We finally had ?the conversation? on Monday afternoon.  It started with, as predicted, a wall of tears when I brought up our relationship but following the advice I just kept going.  I think I sat at the kitchen table for almost 5 hours in total until she finally gave in and sat down to talk without crying. 

There was a whole lot of resentment built up towards me which was why she couldn't face me and tried to keep me busy so I did not have time or energy to focus on the relationship.    

She brought up a lot of things that I did wrong, the fact that I only work 5 hours a week and that's not fair, that I make her feel inadequate by doing everything so well while being ill as well, that I only eat real food and don?t drink which is not fair on her, that I have a better relationship with her mom than she does, the fact that I am really skinny and she has to battle with her weight, that I have a loving family and she doesn?t , and that I am not good at sex which really hurt as she is my one and only and I thought I was doing OK.  

None of that hurt as much as what she said right towards the end of a heated exchange when she blurted out that I ""should be dead by now"". 

After I had had a break and calmed down, I came back into the kitchen to face a diatribe where the long and short of it is she does want children badly; she doesn't want to be married to me because I'm stopping her having them and I'm sick which she is tired of, and only went ahead with getting married knowing we couldn't because she thought I would have died by now.  

She then confessed (not sure that is the right word more like blurted out angrily) that throughout our dating and engagement she had wanted to end it because she didn't want to marry a dying man but could not face telling everyone because they would have thought she was callous.  She said felt she was pressured into marrying me because I was sick, she had thought that I would not survive and  when I died she could find someone else who could have kids.

I was really upset so I left to go to the den and stayed there for the rest of the night;  I didn?t sleep much but thought we could work it through and we could find a way for her to have kids even if I wasn?t around.   I?d even found some agencies that would consider IVF for us given my family would definitely be there for the long haul even if I wasn?t.  

In the morning I made breakfast and waited, she surfaced at about 9 and so I sat her down at the kitchen table and I calmly told what I was thinking about asked her what she wanted to do?  

Again I got a wall of tears but waited them out, then I got a really angry response which made no sense. She said she might not be able to have children anyway, so we should stay together until I die,  and that it was my fault she wouldn't be able to have kids.  

I knew there was a possibility that conceiving could be difficult for her as she'd had a really bad gynaecological infection a few months after my last chemo round.  We argued about this for ages, that she couldn?t know until she tried, that her position did not make sense, she argues against IVF as an option saying it was too difficult for her, that is she really wanted kids naturally then it would-be best to split and her find someone who could give her that. 

Over the space of an hour, it became clear that the infection was not something simple as I had thought. I could not understand how an infection could make you infertile and kept asking what it was. She was really evasive until I made her tell that the infection was chlamydia.  Although she didn't say it out loud just cried when I asked was the result of an affair. 

When I realised what she had finally (not) said through the tears I left, didn't say anymore just collected the dogs from the yard, piled into my Landy and went to my brothers.   

I spent most of the day in bed crying until my brother got me on Skype with my big sis and mum who were great and really practical.  Then I went over to my sis?s place to exercise the dogs with her and that made me feel a little better. 

So since yesterday I?ve had 100+ ignored calls and texts from her, and she?s tried to call my brothers, parents and sisters.  Mer mom has called 10+ times.  My brother has texted her and her mom to leave me alone and that I?ll be in touch when I figure it out.  She showed up at his house while I was at my sister's but he sent her away. 

For me its the end.  I don't want be with someone who has had an affair, who doesn?t like me, who resents what they have given up because of me, who lies, who tells me I?m the one and only partner she?s ever had, who is emotionally weak - who the fuck gets married because they don't want to seem callous.   I?ve wasted the past four years on her, fuck. 

Plan for the rest of today is to pick up my big sis who is flying in from DC with her wife and go with them to see a lawyer they know, pick over how to get out of this mess quickly.  She?s not a divorce lawyer herself but her firm drew up the prenup so it will be good to have her around.   Then she, my brother and sister, and various spouses and friends, are going over to the house to collect my things and clear my den/office.  

I?ll give my soon to be ex about 1/4 hours notice we are coming over but I won?t go in and I can stay in van if she?s there. I?m gonna be moving into mum and dads old house with my sister for a while, there?s loads of space and the dogs will love it. 

(For info I?m pretty sure I?m clean of STI?s because we didn't have sex during that time and I have my bloods done every month but have booked in for extra tests on Thursday - an infection could have killed me but perhaps this was her plans all the way along) 

**tl;dr**: She didn?t want to marry me, but anyway because she thought I wouldn't last too long and when I was last ill she had an affair.  Its over. 

**EDIT**  Its stupid o'clock in the morning and I can't sleep anymore so I came here.  Just to answer a few of the common and not so common but relevant theme in the PM's and comments. 

**Infidelity** As my lawyer pointed out I cannot be sure that she had an affair.  I made the presumption based on her tears and refusal to answer.  She has denied saying that she did in an email to my brother. 

**Chlamydia** It is possible that she had the infection from prior to our relationship although she had told me that I was the only one she had ever had sex with so there's a lie in there somewhere. This could explain that the infection did so much damage i.e. she had it for 4-5 years. 

**Infection and our sex life** We did not have unprotected sex before she was diagnosed. The advice we had was to use a barrier method to ensure that she was not exposed to chemical toxins in my body.   I got really ill a few months after we got married so it ""dried up"" and she had had treatment by the time we went on our honeymoon about a year later.   Our  sex life after that was really very good (or at least 
I thought so) up until about 5 months ago when a lot of things about ""us"" went off the rails. 

**Money** Turns out it really doesn't matter much, the house is on a lease because I couldn't get a mortgage as I'm such a bad risk health wise.  It's in my name so we'll issue a termination and let it lapse. She can take it up anyways.  Currently, most of my income is taken with medical bills so even if she tries to get alimony then there is nothing to share.  As for preexisting monies that pretty much safe with almost no option to challenge.  I've changed my will already to exclude her and yes she did get everything, but I don't think that was a motivation.  

**Is she a monster** I don't think so, right now I hate the thought of her,  but I can see how she got into the situation where she married me thinking that it wouldn't last forever and how she could have felt trapped into the wedding.  I don't think she married me with the thought of getting rich I just think she didn't actually think it through properly.  She did turn out to be a shit though. 

**Do it still love her** Of course I do.  She was my rock during some really dark periods in my life, I wanted to die in her arms, we had so much fun together - I watched a video earlier of us playing air-hockey me in a big coat with bare legs as I only had a hospital gown on underneath her looking amazing lovely - we were so happy.   Notwithstanding all of that I do think we would not have made it in the long term even if I had been healthy all along. My mum thought I only stayed with her because it was the easy thing to do and I'd had enough shit in my life though until last night she had never told me that. 

**Will I let her tell her side of the story** she can say what she wants to whomever she wants except me. I'm done and only need good things in my life. ",1449085092.0,"[UPDATE] Me [27 M] with my wife [29 F] 4 years, I'm getting really fed up being the bottom of the list in my wife's life.",0.97

I know my post didn't get a lot of attention I wanted to update for my peace of mind. 

Jess called me 26 times last night after me going no-contact since my first post. She has been constantly texting me horrible things (I hope you die, your abusive ex should have killed you, you ruined my son's life, etc). Although I am a devistated, I have held my ground. 

Jess fled to Florida last week and I have no idea what is happening now. 

I'm also not sure if I mentioned this in the last post, but Jess is sleeping with our (married) local prosecutor (who has pulled legal strings for her countless times) and I think that he will get involved with whatever CPS is trying to do. 

I feel hopeless so I blocked Jess's contact info, and am keeping records to hand to the investigator involved with her son's case. I can't do anything else currently and it hurts. 

I'm not sure if they'll be returning back to my state, I'm not sure if she is using with her son around. 

I feel lost and I wish I could help, but I can't. I'm just trying to accept that and do what I can.

Hello Reddit. Longtime lurker here, and now it's my turn to post about my conundrum and get outside opinions. I'm really at a loss at to what I need to do. This is really, really long, so apologies in advance. 

My husband and I have been together four years, married for one. Before we met I went to cosmetology school and I loved to express my style by coloring my hair bright colors, wearing dramatic makeup, and stretching my lobes. I enjoyed those things for a few years, and then I outgrew them. I still appreciate such things on others, but my personal style is more conservative now. I've always dressed somewhat modestly, because I don't like showing a lot of skin in public, so it's not like I used to wear daisy Dukes and now I wear burlap sacks. But my hair color is much more ""natural"" these days, my makeup is classic instead of dramatic, and I let my lobes close up. My workplace is quite conservative, so my red lipstick and heels is already pushing the envelope a bit. 

My husband has always known that I used to look edgier than I do now, but I've never dressed like that since we've been together. He's said in the past that he wishes I still had blue hair or stretched lobes, but its always been understood that I no longer want to do those things, and that I would most certainly be fired if I came into work with blue hair. Or at least I thought that was understood. 

I came home two weeks ago to find him looking at some pictures that one of my old friends had posted and tagged me in on FB, and I was in several of the pictures, blue hair and all. He started saying how hot it was, and how he wished I looked like that. He said it would be more exciting and that he had always had a kink for girls with edgier style. Ok, I can work with that! I bought some colored clip ins and surprised him a few nights later. I went all out: colored hair, black thigh highs, cute little panties with skulls on them, and a tight baby doll tee that he's always liked. At first I thought he was really into it, but after we had sex he said that he thought the ""trial run"" had gone well, and now I should commit to an edgier style. I explained that I didn't want to dress like I used to, that I enjoyed doing it in the privacy of our home, but I wasn't going to wear fishnets and combat boots to the grocery store. He got quiet and asked why I wouldn't do this for him. I said that I wasn't trying to hurt his feelings, and that I was more than happy to dress up for him for sex or a date. I just am not going to bleach and color my hair or stretch my lobes again. 

He stayed quiet for the rest of the night, and refused to discuss it with me any further. He ended up getting up and sleeping on the couch, and had already left when I got up for work. That evening he came home after work and said that he'd done some thinking, and he'd thought of a compromise. He wants me to to get my clit pierced, because that way I'll be ""edgy"" but it won't be hard to cover like stretched lobes or bright hair. I considered it while I fixed supper, and later than night I said that I would probably be ok with getting my nipples pierced, but that I wasn't comfortable with a genital piercing. I've never been intimate with another person, and the idea of someone else seeing and touching my vulva/clit is very uncomfortable for me. I don't think it would bother me as much if it was my breasts, and if nipple piercings would make me husband happy, I would be willing to try. He blew up and said that I was boring and plain, and why couldn't I just give him what he wanted? He said that he had always hoped that I would regain my old style, but that he was becoming disappointed because I still hadn't after four years. He went on and on about how boring I am and how a wife who wanted to keep her husband satisfied would agree to a clit piercing if that's what he wanted. He said that he wants to use me and make me cry and see my makeup run down my face. He said that regular anal and PIV isn't enough anymore, and that my blowjobs are terrible because I don't want to deepthroat him or be facefucked. He kept going and going, shouting at me and turning bright red. I started crying because I was hurt and humiliated, and he told me to shut up. Then he left for two days and wouldn't answer his phone. When he came back he started giving me the silent treatment and sleeping in the guest room. 

He seems to think that I was a different person back in those days. I wasn't. I wasn't promiscuous or ""easy"". For pete's sake, I was a virgin when we started dating! And I'm not withholding or cold sexually. I'm willing to try almost anything once. We have anal sex once or twice a week, PIV six or seven times a week, and he gets a few blowjobs a week. We've tried light bondage, spanking, and role play. The only things we've tried that I don't like is face fucking and facials. Both feel very degrading and humiliating. I'm not sure if it's just the act itself, or if it's the way my husband treats me during and after these acts, but I don't enjoy them. He got very upset when I told him this, but he hasn't asked about doing those acts in a few months, with the exception of mentioning it during his rant about clit piercings. He wasn't willing to try cuddling afterwards, or talking to me affectionately during, he just quit mentioning it altogether. 

It's been days since the piercing discussion, and he hadn't mentioned sex once. He's barely speaking to me. He's been leaving his computer on with pictures and videos of heavily pierced and tattooed porn stars getting facefucked or roughly anally penetrated, but he won't speak to me. I don't know what to do. Do I leave? Should I ask him to leave? It seems so silly to leave him over something as insignificant as a clit piercing, but he really hurt me when he yelled and called me boring. 

TL;DR: Husband wants me to dress edgier, and when I said I didn't want to dress like that all the time, he suggested I get my clit pierced. I said no because I'm not comfortable with it. He called me boring and said that he wants to use my body and make me cry. Now he's giving me the cold shoulder and sleeps in another room.

397,aightillbite,Non-Romantic,aw49k1,2437,"I?m not really sure how to start this post so I?ll just give some backstory first:

One of my best friends lives in a different country. We met years ago online and have talked almost daily to what is approaching a decade. We have both flown back and forth once or twice a year to see the other and hang out, and we?ve always been their for each other?s big moments. 

She found out last year that she is expecting her first child, and it was amazing news for us all, I was so happy for her to start the family I know she?s always wanted with her husband [31M]. She came to visit a few months into her pregnancy and asked me to be the baby?s godmother - I was over the moon. 
While we live an 8 hour plane ride from each other, I do have a job that gives me decent vacation allowance and deals with certain airlines that makes visiting manageable. I knew that I could be there for her, and told her that whenever she was ready for someone outside of the family to be there, I would make the trip. 


Last month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn?t been invited. I was a little hurt, and surprised, but it was the busiest month of the year for the company I work for, and I knew she knew that, so I figured that could be the reason, sent my gift by airmail and said congratulations. 

However now she?s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby?s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. I felt like I?d been punched in the gut. I was heartbroken, and felt a bit betrayed, for 6 months I have been excited to take on the role - my own godmother lives in New Zealand, and has done for most of my life, so I knew it could work.m, knew how to stay in contact and be a part of the child?s life while living in another country. But now she?s taken back her offer, and chosen someone else.

I wouldn?t be so upset if she had chosen someone who lived closer, but she has replaced me with someone who lives in the same city as me, so it?s not a distance thing. We have been friends for years, I have been there with updates, support and love her whole pregnancy, and at no point was there any clue she had changed her mind... until the baby shower a few weeks ago. 

I don?t know if I should confront her, tell her I?m hurt, or just accept her decision, it?s her baby, and I would never want to force her into a decision she wasn?t happy with. I just don?t know what to do or say to her now. I want to let her know I?m sad that I?m missing out, but I don?t want to sound like I?m whining, and I want to know why she changed her mind, but I?m scared the answer will just upset me. What should I do? 


TL:DR: My best friend asked me to be the godmother of her child months ago, now, with the due date approaching, she?s chosen someone else and given no explanation.

398,ihtmittt,Relationships,4tp3k6,2433,"My husband and I have a 3 year old son together. In addition to our son, I also take care of our 4 year old niece -my husband's sister's daughter- on Fridays because she is a single mother and works full time. My husband volunteered me, but I was happy to do it because I work from home and she's a sweet girl. Plus it saves my sister-in-law money on daycare, so that's good, too. I originally agreed to do this because my husband works half-days on Friday, meaning he was home for the afternoon to help me out. Having two kids under 5 in the house is a handful, but I was able to handle the morning. 

Well, a month ago my husband told me his boss was upping his hours to work on a special project for the forseeable future. He would have to work an hour later on the weekdays and go back to full-days on Friday. This was a disappointment, but I didn't want to go put my sister-in-law in the tough position of trying to find and pay for a sitter on Fridays. So I figured I could handle the two kids, even if it would be tough. And I have. It's been difficult, I have to work later in the evenings because I don't get as much done in the day, but I've been managing it. 

Last Friday, I was at the grocery store with the kids. I saw my boss's wife and chatted to her for a bit. I made some comment about how much of a bummer it was how everyone was working more hours, and she looked confused. She said if that was happening her husband wasn't being a very good boss, because he was home every day like normal and working half Fridays. I ended the conversation and went home.

That night I asked my husband why if he was working more, his boss wasn't. He looked nervous and said that it was only for lower-level employees. I said that was bullshit and that he needed to tell me the truth. Turns out, he hasn't been working more. He's been going to hang out at a friend's house every day and on Friday afternoons he just does whatever the hell he wants. He said he needed a break from how busy we are with our son and on Fridays with our niece. 

I'm furious. First off, he lied to me. Secondly, he has left me alone to take care of *our* kid and *his* sister's kid, who he volunteered me to take care of! And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I told him he needs to be home at the correct time from now on, and he responded that he still ""needs his alone time"", and that the kids are ""too much."" Fucking yeah, it's a lot of work, but I have to deal with it all on my own? I mean, am I being unreasonable here? I get that it's a lot, but I don't feel like that gives him the right to unilaterally decide he can have some time off. What do I do?

399,miraand,Non-Romantic,4lpati,2430,"My mom and my MIL threw me a surprise baby shower on Sunday and invited all of my family and most of my friends who are in my hometown. It was great, I don't usually get to see everyone when I visit so it was really nice to have them all there. My sister is also pregnant, she is 34 weeks and I am 36 weeks. My mom and I have been planning her baby shower with her that will be two weeks from now. 


At the shower, everyone kept complimenting me on how tiny I am and how good I look and I could see my sister was getting really jealous. It was really upsetting her so I tried to change the topic but after the first little bit she retreated to a table in the corner with her friend looking incredibly angry. I tried to ignore it and we started playing shower games. Later, her friend asked if any of us knew where she was since she hadn't seen her in a while. Everyone was extremely worried because she wasn't answering her phone and we thought she could have gone into labor or fallen or something terrible. The shower was in a party room at an arena so it's a huge building and everyone there (~70 of us) began searching the entire place up and down looking for her. Many people got into their cars to drive around the area and the different routes to the hospital to see if they saw her car. We also called her husband to see if he had heard from her and he left work to help look. 


My other sister found her sulking inside a timmies. She refused to come back to the shower because she was upset that she wasn't getting any attention and everyone was fawning over me. It took a while for everyone who left to get back and while we tried to carry on with the shower, the whole mood was soured and it was really awkward.


I'm so upset with her now. I suspect once the baby comes I won't go down to my hometown as much and I won't get to see many of those people as often as I did before, so that was my last chance to get together with everyone before the baby. It's not even the first time she's done something like this. At my wedding she complained to anyone who was willing to listen about how my husband is very touchy-feely with me. And now whenever he touches me in any way in front of her she'll grumble and roll her eyes like she is upset that he is attracted to me or something. He dropped me off at the shower and when we were talking to friends he was standing behind me holding my belly and she said ""that's disgusting"" and made a gagging noise. She also won't show up to something unless someone has called her to ask where she is and tell her were waiting for her, it's a little game that she likes to play. I don't know what her problem is but I'm so sick of it. 


She hasn't spoken to me since the incident and won't return my calls or texts but I think she owes me an apology. If she can't apologize I don't think I want to continue to plan and pay for her baby shower. Is that fair? My mom and my aunt think I just need to try to move past it because ""that's just how she is."" My husband feels differently and he thinks I should stop doing anything for her because she continuously disrespects* us and our marriage. 


**tl;dr**: My very pregnant sister left my baby shower without telling anyone which made everyone worry and go searching for her, only to find her sulking because she wasn't getting attention. She won't talk to me now and I think she should apologize or I will stop paying for and planning her shower but my mom says that's unfair.

400,,Non-Romantic,2s03z7,2437,"I'm really in a bind here and desperate for ideas.

I am 36 years old, I have been married for 12 years to my wife who is 33. We have a 10 year old girl, a 7 year old boy and a 5 year old girl.

My wife has a younger sister who is an absolute train wreck and basket case. She is 29 and has already been married and divorced twice. She has Borderline Personality disorder and is an alcoholic. She has two girls, 8 and 6, from her marriages (one from each). Both of her husbands were abusive losers to her and my nieces.

The first husband split as soon as she gave birth to niece #1 and no one ever saw or heard from him again.
The second husband is a drug addict who makes a hobby out of being unemployed so he doesn't have to pay child support.

Because of my Sister-in-Law's wild and crazy mood swings, suicide attempts, and alcoholism she lost custody of her daughters and my wife's parents, who are in their 60's, have been taking care of and raising them for 3 years now.

My wife and I visit her parents quite often and we are very close with them. We also see my nieces and they really are sweet girls although they do act out sometimes (though who could blame them?)

Recently more family tragedy struck. My MIL has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and will have to start radiation and chemotherapy immediately. My FIL has arthritis and is starting to lose his hearing and sight.

They recently approached us and asked if we would assume custody and raise my nieces, because they are just too old and sick to do it anymore. 

While my wife wanted to immediately say yes I asked if we could please have time to talk it over and discuss it, to which they graciously replied for us to take our time.

Now while I genuinely love my nieces, and my heart breaks for their situation...I do NOT want to raise them! I'm breaking into a sweat and fighting off a panic attack just thinking about it.

I have a full time job and three young and very needy children. My wife, bless her, is a very good mother, has a part time job to help supplement our income and is a wonderful and supportive partner, but she is ZERO help around the house.

She's terrible at keeping the house clean and is an awful cook, so after I come home from work, I have to cook dinner and make sure the house is tidy. I have my kids help out with the chores but of course they can only do so much.

Then I have to spend time and play with my children, help with homework, etc. My wife helps them get ready for bed and reads to them while I do dishes.

Then I have to make time for my wife.

I am EXHAUSTED and OVERWHELMED. My weekends are spent cleaning inside and out and doing family activities.

While my wife has promised to help with our neices, realistically I know a majority of the responsibility will fall to me.

I can't handle more stress. I can't handle the chaos of TWO MORE young children who demand attention and time.

I'm already spread thin spending time one on one with each of my children, how can I possibly give it to TWO MORE???

That's two more mouths to feed, two more children to clothe, shelter and provide for and educate, and we will be getting zero financial assistance from the dead beat SIL and her two ex husbands.

The thing is, my wife has no other siblings and I'm an only child. I don't think there is ANYONE else who can take these children. My in laws can no longer raise them. We are all that is left. The only other option is foster care.

I would feel AWFUL putting my neices in foster care. But I just don't think I can do it. I feel completely paralyzed. I've already had two break downs over this decision (out of sight from my wife and children). I'm depressed, I have no appetite. I feel like a failure as a man, as a father and as a family member.

I can't sacrifice my children's well being for my nieces. I won't be able to be a good father/uncle to my neices and I know I'll just be going through the motions with my own children if I take on anymore responsibility.

But I don't know how I'll live with myself if I let my nieces go into the system. I feel borderline suicidal by this point, but I'm trying to keep it together for the sake of everyone.

I don't know what to do or think. Please help

**TL;DR My in laws have been raising my two nieces because my SIL and her two exes deserve the worst parents ever award. My in laws are too old and sick to take care of them anymore and have asked my wife and I to take over. I already have 3 young children and a full time career and I just can't handle anymore. But if I don't take them, they'll have to go into foster care. I'm starting to feel depressed and suicidal over this decision and I need help.**

EDIT: I sincerely appreciate all the replies. I'm reading all of them, and aside from one asshole, these are all wonderful suggestions. I feel more calm now reading these responses than I have ever since my in laws asked this of us. I'm going to take a day off work and just relax, go to a coffee shop and read a book. Then I'm going to have a talk with my wife about everything, and discuss options from there.

401,worriedneighbor5,Personal issues,4ec1py,2419,"So, I?m not sure if this is cause for concern or I?m paranoid so maybe all of you can figure this out for me?
 
 
Backstory:
 
My fianc?, James, and I have been together for 3 years- planning a wedding for October 2016. A few months before we met, James brought a brand new home in a newer subdivision. We recently refinanced it and added my name.
 
Before me, James dated a woman, Britt, for about 7 months (she?s never been to this current house). From what he?s told me, they broke up when he decided they weren?t as compatible. The breakup was rough- to the point where he and neighbors called the police when she wouldn?t leave his front yard and was screaming at 10 pm at night. This is all from what he and his sister have told me. I don?t have a reason to not believe them. I?ve only had a few run-ins with Britt. These have been at restaurants or just coincidences out in public. We never spoke up until now.
 
The problem:
 
Britt has bought a house in the same subdivision that we live in. We even share a cul-de-sac. The only reason we found out about this is from a flyer we got welcoming her to the neighborhood (our subdivision is very ?community? oriented). James insists he?s never told her where he lives and hasn?t spoken to her since the night he called the police.  We both brushed it off as a coincidence but lately it?s becoming very weird.
 
Here?s why:
 
-I work for a company that allows me to work from home 3 out of the 5 days. Our home is a ranch and my office window faces the street. I?m not sure what Britt does for a living but she does not work during the day. From about noon until 3, she spends her time walking up and down our street. When she passes our house, she doesn?t take her eyes off of it. It?s almost like she can see me in the office. She?ll even stop in front of our house and stretch there for about 5 minutes. Every day anyone is at home. It makes me uncomfortable to the point where I have all of our blinds closed during the day. I understand the need for exercise but she walks for 3 hours just going up and down our street.
 
-Another issue is when either James or I are outside with the dog, she?ll let her dog outside and it will come sprinting to our yard. This causes her to come and get her dog. Every time she says ?I?m sorry, were still working on training.? James and I are always polite. Normally, I would be ok with this but James has pointed out that any other time she lets her dog out and we?re not outside, she?ll immediately correct him before he runs off. She never corrects him when we?re outside.
 
-We?ve been getting ?ding dong ditched? a lot since she?s moved in. Something that?s NEVER happened in the 4 years that James owned the house. The doorbell will ring around dinner time (between 6 and 8) and by the time anyone gets to the door, no one will be there. It?s gotten to the point where our Doberman has picked up the routine and waits by the front door, pacing.  
 
-The last issue, which I believe might be illegal, is that our mail seems to go missing for a while and then pop back up. What I mean is, Britt will knock on our door and say that she received our mail and is just returning it. This has NEVER happened with the previous owners in her house. We don?t have a new mail carrier either. It seems to happen once a week and she?ll always bring it on a Friday night. Based on the date on the envelopes, we can tell she?s been holding it all week. This has pushed James over the edge because she had our water bill which resulted in us being 2 days late on the payment (James is neurotic when it comes to paying bills). Every time I have to convince him not to go over and yell at her because we haven?t actually caught her taking it out of our mailbox as much as I try to monitor it. She usually gets two days-worth of mail because those are the days I?m not working from home, the other days I get it right away.
 
I?m not sure what to do at this point.  I don?t want to piss her off by confronting her but how can I get her to stop? She?s making us nervous and I feel uncomfortable in my own yard most of the time because I know she is watching.
 
Any advice? I know this sounds strange but I?m not sure if I can legally do anything about it. I don?t have anything against her; it?s just becoming an annoyance.

I had no idea my post would get so much attention. There was a lot of really solid advice (and one creepy PM warning me that by dressing in business attire and wearing lipstick and heel I was being overly sexual around my child and that would turn my son into a serial killer. Stay gold, reddit)

A couple of clarifying points

* My MIL did work when my husband was growing up, she just did not have an office job. She works in a medical field and wears scrubs everyday. When she's not in scrubs, she's in sweatpants. Seriously. For our wedding, his family started a pool about whether or not she would wear sweats to the wedding.

* I did not suddenly get sexy after my son was born. I was slightly overweight before my son was born and I'm back to my pre-baby slightly overweight shape.


Now the update:

Dan and I went out without our son so we could talk. I told him that I was confused by his comment and I wanted to talk about it. I asked him if he could name specific things about the morning routine that made him feel as though our son was neglected. I offered to ""switch shifts"" so to speak if he though our son should have more AM parent time. To make a long and confusing conversation short- Dan's confused by the fact that I got over my postpartum depression and am back to normal now. For some context, my PPD never made me question whether or not I loved my son or made me feel like we never should have had him. My PPD made me feel like I was constantly failing my son, that I wasn't good enough to be his mom and that he deserved better. There were a few times I broke down and started crying and would tell Dan that he was so much better at being a parent than I was and that our son didn't deserve to have a shitty mom like me. Luckily, I have an amazing DR who recognized that this wasn't just baby blues and helped me get the help I needed. It could have been much worse.

Basically, Dan only felt like a good parent when I was failing and telling him that I was terrible at it. Now that I'm doing better, he no longer feels like a good dad. It's shitty, but we're staring couple counseling, I'm continuing with the counseling I started for my PPD and Dan's going to see someone too. We're going to figure it out. And I'm still going to wear heels to work even though it's going to turn my son into an axe murderer.

TL;DR- My husband felt inadequate once I dealt with my postpartum issues and tried to undermine me to feel better. We're getting counseling and my baby is going to be a serial killer.

She talks all day long. To me, to others, to her sister on the phone, etc. If you don't talk to her, she gets her feelings hurt and then huffs and puffs all day long. Or she leaves and goes to some other department to talk about us. 

She fights with someone at least once a day. Me, her husband, her sister, our boss. Speaking of which...

If I say ""it's a nice day out"" - I will get 100 reasons back on why it isn't a nice day. She can literally argue about anything with anyone. The one time I stopped the ""fight"" and told her I didn't care about what we were arguing about - she cried for the rest of the afternoon. 

I get constant commentary on my actions - especially with food (I am on a diet and SHOULD be). God forbid I don't eat the amount of food she thinks I should. It is like having the mother you never wanted telling you your not eating enough. OH...she is also a ""vegan"" (Except for the **bacon** she eats every morning). 

So we get preachy commentary also about meat, straws, recycling, animals, tree-hugging (literally) etc. All while she eats bacon, uses 100 Styrofoam cups a day, has non-neutered pets etc. Basically shes a hypocrite. 

Gotta go to the bathroom? Well you should have asked her also if she needed to go so you both could go together. If its time to go to a meeting together she will yell rudely ""are we going or not?"". She acts like we are all joined at the hip. 

Are you cold? Well she is colder. Are you sick? She's been sicker. Family member died? Well hers are deader. We are always in some weird competition with her. Especially if it has to do with being seen as small, sickly, victim-y. It is so bizarre. 


She doesn't pull her weight at work. She is hidden from our bosses view - so she spends hours on her phone. If you try to get her to help out or cover for someone on vacation she gives about 100 reasons why she can't or just flat out doesn't do what she says she will.

I truly needed them, as I was completely blind to the pain that I was causing my family. I am truly sorry for disregarding the pain of my family. 

After making this thread and seeing the responses, I talked to my wife and son while my daughter was away, and I apologized for making excuses for her and not acknowledging how much I hurt them. We all cried for a long time and aired out a lot of feelings, and I was forgiven. Then, we all agreed to have a family intervention for our daughter. The deal was that she either goes to treatment or she doesn't get to stay in the home. My daughter was oddly unemotional during the meeting despite our pleas and crying, but she agreed to go to another treatment center about 200 miles away from home. We expected her to return today. 

But our lives changed about 40 days after we dropped her off. We received a call from the police department near the treatment center, and they told us that a young woman was found hanging in a motel that morning. She left a note with her name, me and my wife's names, my phone number, and something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for everything, Mom & Dad & [Brother], but I will never be better. Good bye."" 

She was finally cremated last month, and we spread her ashes over the park we used to play in. I miss her every day, even though the last few years made us fucking miserable. The other 20 years (I adopted her when she was 2) were amazing, and those are the years I choose to remember. I remember her infectious smile and intelligence and how she could make me melt  without even trying. We all separately admitted to choosing to remember her this way, and not in the way she ultimately ended up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3s519n/me_23f_with_my_husband_25m_married_3_months_he/) is the original post if you'd like to see it.

Thank you for all of the replies. It was nice to know that I was actually being reasonable in this situation with my husband. To all the people who said my husband is a complete dick or that we should get divorced, thanks but we're okay. Nothing a little communication can't fix.

Anyways, to the good stuff. After I got all the responses, I told my husband that we needed to talk. He could tell something was up and that I was upset, so as soon as I got home from work we sat down and talked.

I explained to him that while I have always not liked that he watches TV at night, I *really* do think the TV being on is what causes my back pain. I told him that I could see why he thought I was just trying to control him with it, but that I loved him and just wanted some relief from an achey back.

My husband first apologized and said he didn't realize how serious it was. I can sort of be a baby and a complainer when it comes to pain, so I really can't blame him there.

Next, I told him we should figure out a solution that works for both of us. We talked about getting some kind of white noise maker or a sleep mask for me, but I really do just prefer a dark, quiet room. He also didn't think that white noise would put him to sleep. So, our compromise is that we are going to watch a movie or TV show on the couch every night before going to bed (he ALWAYS falls asleep when watching a movie or longer TV show) and then when we go to the bedroom we can just go straight to sleep.

It's worked the past two nights PERFECTLY. He's asleep by time the movie is over so I just nudge him and tell him to walk to the bedroom and then he falls back asleep immediately.

So, thanks again reddit! A little communication was the only thing needed. 

   
TLDR: Husband and I figured out a solution. We'll watch a movie before bed so he falls asleep then go to the bedroom with no TV on. 

**Edit: Holy shit I can't believe this reached the front page of /r/relationships!**

**For everyone saying to use the sleep timer on the TV: we have already thought of this. It doesn't work because he ends up falling asleep before me and then starts snoring.**

Update 1: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3plw8j/update_i_am_a_21f_that_has_had_tinder_for_6/

Well, I restarted my Tinder profile yesterday and already got a couple of matches.  I don't know if the first profile just wasn't working or if Reddit just came to my rescue, haha.  Doesn't really explain the lack of OKC success, but I'm planning to start that up again too.

The main thing was that I talked to my friend.  I asked her for some advice on how to fix my looks.  She was really, really harsh about it.  She said it was doubtful I could fix things, that she felt sorry for me, that escorts were expensive but she'd front me the money if I wanted to lose my virginity (WTF?).  I decided I didn't need her in my life.  It sucks, because she was pretty much my only friend.

I gave myself a look in the mirror and decided that I'm not all that ugly.  Sure, I'm not beautiful like my friend is or like a lot of girls on this college campus, but I'm okay.  I'm a good person, I have something to offer, and I'll just keep searching.  There's no point in crying over the opinion of someone mean like my friend.  I may not be a fitness model or beauty queen, but I'm okay.  

I had a conversation with one of my Tinder matches and he seems genuinely nice, so I'll see how that goes.

I am going to put in some more effort into my face and body.  I think exercise would help me.  I'm not about to sculpt myself or anything right now, but jogging a few times a week seems like a good start.  And I'm about to go to the drugstore and buy myself a couple more pieces of makeup, maybe a new cardigan or two.  We'll see how it goes.

408,keepouringoutofme,Relationships,5ruzp4,2407,"My husband doesn't like to go out much. It's not something that I've ever faulted him for or been mad at him about. We've never gotten in fights about it til now and it's something he told me upfront when we had first gotten in the relationship 4 years ago. ""I'm never going to be the kind of person that likes to go out a lot, I just want to hang out at home"" and I of course said that it was fine because that's not a flaw to me, it's just a character trait. 


I used to suffer from depression due to a lot of traumas in my life. I found it really hard to go outside at all, and especially alone. I missed out on a lot of experiences because of this. In our first year of dating, he got me to have more confidence in myself so I stopped hiding. I got a therapist and have been on a wonderful little antidepressant. We got married one year later and I'm still happier than I have ever been, and I'm incredibly grateful to have him in my life. That hasn't changed one bit.


Now, I know that this isn't want he does. I know that he doesn't stay inside because he's depressed, it's because it's in his nature to be a housecat. And like I said, I'm still fine with that. Lately he's not okay with me doing this, though. 


If I ask him if he wants to see a movie with me and he said ""no"" or the more common, ""I don't know, maybe"" I'll usually ask him two more times and then if he still says no or ""maybe"" I'll go by myself. It's the same with going out to dinner, taking little classes, etc. We had fun with this at first. I would come home from doing the thing and then I would excitedly tell him what I'd done and the people I'd met. He'd happily listen and hug me and kiss me on the forehead. It was a really beautiful thing. At one point we called it ""my little adventures"" and I would take polaroid pictures and show them to him and then hang them on the kitchen wall. It was a seriously beautiful point in our relationship and the times that we would go out and take polaroids together were some of the happiest times in my life. I even made it a point to have us do / go to things that *he* liked to do. It was great. It was seriously so great.


About two years ago I asked him, ""Hey, I've been really passionate about learning a language and eventually going to this languages place of origin. Do you want to study it with me and then go there too?"" and he said no to the language, but maybe to going with me. 


Cut to now and I'm pretty damn good at this language. I decided about four months ago that I am going to this place. I asked him and he would still like to come with me and he said no and got kind of upset that I had learned this language without him. ""You're the one that's going to know anything, there's really no point in me going."" I was kind of taken aback because during the process he was really supportive. I didn't really push it, but I apologized and went somewhere else to clear my head about things and we were fine later on that day. I bought the tickets for me and my mother to go ""the place"" about four weeks ago and ever since then, things have been really tense. If I ask him to do minor things, like come to the grocery store with me, he gets a bit of an attitude. I can tell that he knows this is ridiculous though, because he'll say sorry almost immediately and be sad and quiet the rest of the time.


I've tried to talk to him about what's bothering him, but he keeps either saying that it's nothing and he doesn't want to talk about it, or will tell me not to press it and then get mad and leave. I don't know what to do at this point. Our relationship has been so great, but I can feel things being strained. I can feel him kind of slipping away. I don't know what to do. I thought about buying him a ticket to ""the place"" anyway and surprising him, because I really would love it if he could go with me and I know for a fact it's somewhere he's always been interested in. But I also don't want to force him, because I hate forcing people to do things. However, I also don't want to do stop having these experiences for myself just because he doesn't want to. I've never faulted him for wanting to be at home, so why is he faulting me for wanting to be outside? I don't know how to talk to him or what to say. If I have to stop doing things, then... I guess I will? But I also feel bad for having to stop, but it's not worth getting a divorce over or having things escalate that bad. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here.

**Edit/Update:** Hi! Um, we had a bit of a long talk. I'm kind of a mix of exhausted / drained / excited now so I apologize if I make a lot of typos or word something wrong. In a kind of big nutshell: He said he feels like he's drowning in my success. I said I would learn a language and I did it. I said I would lose 180lbs and I did it earlier in our relationship and got the skin surgery. I have a pretty stress free job and it's getting to him. He's been trying really hard to just be happy but it's hard. He understands that it's wrong to feel this way and between feeling guilty about it and feeling this way at all, it's just been taking its toll. He also has a skin condition that makes him feel cautious of going outside, especially in another country. :( I never thought this would be the problem, because he's always acted as though it's not a bother to him at all and he doesn't care.  He's going to keep trying though, and to seek therapy independent of me because he thinks that he also may really be suffering from depression.


Now, I have to say that we *do* have communication problems. Our friendship (two years before dating) started off long distance in an mmorpg so we're still kind of better with text-talking than outloud speaking. Sometimes we have a hard time saying when things are bothering us out loud, so we'll text it out and then read off of that text because we find it hard to verbalise and sometimes we just take things harder than we should. We've agreed to go to marriage counselling and we're making an appointment together tomorrow, so there are good things afoot.

For more good news: He's agreed to go on vacation with me and my mother!

Also, I just want to say thank you to every single person who commented. It means a lot that people would wish us good luck and give advice and even say they were going to pray. Thank you for all of the advice! I'm trying to go down and thank everyone one-by-one but it might take a while, and in case I can't... thank you for helping save us.  

**Uh, edit to the edit!** I would also like to add that I messed up in this, too. I liked to think that hearing maybe / other apathetic answers instead of just yes or no didn't bother me, but it did. And sometimes, as some people pointed out, I would get kind of passive aggressive about it. I'd ask him simply because it meant that I tried at times. I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I'm going to work on that more and myself as well.

The original didn't get much attention, but here goes for anybody who ever wanted what happened.

I ended up leaving her alone and decided to fix myself. I knew the way I treated her was horrible. I made a promise to myself that from then on, I would be sure to treat people the way they deserve. You shouldn't take people for granted, especially when they're nothing but good to you. Nobody deserves the way I treated her the first time around. I learned a lot in the time I took alone. Why I treated her the way I did and I looked carefully into the excuses I made. I did end up sleeping around, yeah. I did a lot of things I wanted to do(not with women, in life), and some things I'm ashamed of. I learned who I want to be, who I am, and how to get to that point. I'm still improving. But I still regretted the way I treated her for a long time. A really, really, really long time. And I still do.

6 months after I posted, I ran into her jogging in the park. It was the first time I saw her since the concert. We spoke for a long time. Not about us - just about life and how we've been. Her and the new boyfriend had broken up, but I didn't expect that meant we would become anything. To my surprise, we began talking and hanging out again. I thought I'd never see her again. She was very wary on hanging out with me and I understood why. We'd meet up and walk in the park for a few hours, every week or so for almost a year. 

One day she came over my house again, and well. We began going out on actual dates and I learned how to communicate. I don't hold things in anymore. We both hang out with each others friends now, and I guess there's so many things I never noticed about her. She's very sweet, beautiful, funny, and highly intelligent. I really hit the jackpot both times but this time I know I won't mess it up. So far it's been almost a year since she came over again, and things are well. I'm going to keep working on myself to be the best person I could be. Thanks for knocking some sense into me /r/relationships.

I called Sarah's home phone the morning after I got her message. Her mom answered and told me she was out with Joe. We chatted for a few minutes, and.then she suddenly started crying. She told me she feels like she's lost her daughter. She said she would ask Sarah to call me. I didn't get a call back. 


The next day I got a surprise visit from Lily, who Sarah and I were really good friends with in college. Lily and I had fallen out of touch and I was really excited to see her again. That night I took her to a party. An actor that Sarah always liked was there, and Lily ended up hitting it off with him and posting a picture of the three of us doing shots on Facebook. 


That night I got a text from Sarah saying, ""Since when do you hang out with (actor)?"" I was extremely annoyed and didn't respond. An hour later she texted ""I guess you're too much of a celebrity to respond.""


I spent about an hour ranting to poor Lily, and then composed an email to Sarah. I think I kept it pretty unemotional. Basically, I told her that she had really hurt me by cutting me out of her life, and I didn't think it was fair for her to suddenly reappear with no explanation or apology. I also said that I think her relationship with Joe is toxic and that I hope she overcomes her fear of being alone so that she can stop jumping into unhealthy relationships. Finally I told her that both her mother and I are worried about her, but I don't have the time or emotional energy to keep trying anymore. If she wants to get in touch when she's fixed her personal issues, I'll be open to listening. Until then, we're not friends anymore.

I?m a successful engineer and architect. Did it on my own, no help from parents. I moved from their house at eighteen and lived on my own, and paid for my own things ever since. Paid for my own college with loans, and paid those all back with my own job.


Sister was different. They spoiled her. She was the baby. My dad was earning more money by the time she was born and since I was out of the house they had more money to buy her whatever she wanted, including a thirty thousand dollar wedding when she was 22, to a guy two years younger than her who never went to college. She went to college for a degree in fashion and did a grand total of nothing with it. 


Her husband has always been spotty with employment, and my parents are always bailing him and my sister out because his own parents are dead or don?t talk to him. He?s supposed to be a professional DJ.


Anyway I have a large apartment in the city where I live with my wife [39] and daughter [4]. I own a small beach condo (two bedrooms). My family usually goes there when the weather is good.


My sister and her husband are getting thrown out of their apartment because both of them are deadbeats.


My mom and dad are I guess tired of giving them money because now my mom is telling me I should either give my sister money or let her and her husband live in my beach house rent free.


I don?t want them to live in my beach house, and told my mother as much. My mom says I?m being cruel and selfish.


What?s ?cruel and selfish? I think is the fact that mom and dad live in a three bedroom house and haven?t invited sister and her husband to live with them but are putting it on me.


My wife is being nice about it and telling me to do what?s right but I can tell she will miss visiting the beach house.


Plus I think that once my sister and her worthless husband get in, they will never leave.


My parents are telling me to ?man up? and be a big brother.


Looking for advice on how to best handle this in a way that doesn?t let them have my beach house, but still isn?t cruel, and is helpful.



Tl;dr: sister and her husband want to live in my beach house for free. I say no. My mom says I?m mean. I say what?s mean is them not even spotting me five bucks for gas in college when they spent at least fifty thousand on my sister?s fashion AA at FIDM.

So I decided to try to talk to my girlfriend casually about the account. 


I told her that when she was letting me use her phone (I logged her out of Instagram and was going to log into mine so that I could post a photo directly from her phone, and saw the other account as an option) I noticed the other account.


She looked horrified at first, but then without any prompting at all she confessed that she had a super insecure day after exactly the incident I was discussing with other commenters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/dapmmqk/?st=iw8j5cz5&sh=51581fcc)  (so thank you very much for making me introspect, reddit). She ranted to her best friend about how she was feeling, and the two of them made the account. They crept the accounts that accepted the follow requests, her friend helped her boost her ego a bit with some girl talk, and she completely forgot about it. 


She said she was having a really hard time when I was depressed, but felt like she couldn?t complain about it because my pain was ?worse,? so she just sort of let a whole bunch get to her over time. 


She told me that she felt her poor handling of certain things this summer (her words), and the massive insecurity she felt, was an indicator that she probably needed to talk to someone and work through some things, and she?s actually been seeing a therapist every other week or so for the past few months. This wasn't just due to the summer, as she felt she's needed to do this for a while, it was just sort of what motivated her.

This shocked me, and she apologized for not telling me. She says that she felt like she couldn?t complain to me about her mental health when she knew I was going through so much. And then when I started to get better she didn?t know how to randomly bring it up since some time had past. 

I had no idea how hard my depression was on her. I feel so selfish that I didn?t even notice, but she says she completely understands, and she know how preoccupying depression can be. 

All in all, she apologized profusely for the account, deleted it in front of me, and we promised to try to get back to being the good communicators we were before my depression hit. 

TL;DR - Talked to her. She was embarrassed, had forgotten about the account, and revealed why she made the account without any prompting. She took trying to support me during my depression harder than I realized, and we're going to try to be better communicators.

**TLDR: nobody was cheating, but my sister fucked up my parents relationship.  Mom is crying now and has gone to stay with her parents, won't talk to my sister or me.**

Yeah, things didn't go so well unfortunately.

I kept arguing with my sister.  I told her if she's so certain they're cheating, the least we could do is ask dad first if he knows about the tape but not mention that we've seen it.  She was determined that it was cheating, based on the hands and the feet, she was like ""those definitely aren't dads"".

I told her she was creepy as fuck, if that was them in the video, and God knows how many times she's watched it, she was basically watching a video of *our mother* naked and fucking our dad's dick. Even if it wasn't our dad's dick, its still fucking gross.  She didn't care.  I told her if I couldn't stop her, she should at least leave me out of it, i want nothing to do with it.

She went nuclear, she went and told them everything, and embarrassed the fuck out of herself.  Turned out her little detective work was way off, it *was* dad in the video.

Our dad was angry but mostly bewildered, but he just laughed it off and got over it.

Our mom however didn't take it so well.  She had a panic attack, she went nuts.  She was like ""what the hell is wrong with you kids?""  I tried to stay out of it but my sister dragged me into it and named me as her accomplice even though I had warned her against it.  Our mom was so hurt and upset, not only that her daughter would so brazely accuse her of cheating, but that her children had watched an explicit sex tape of her.  She was really traumatized, she couldn't take it any more.

She got up and left to her parents house where she's been there for a whole day to recuperate.  She only called our dad to speak to, she won't speak to us.  Our dad told us to just give it time until she's feeling better.

Currently typing this from my hospital bed because he beat the shit out of me.


Just kidding.


Some posters tried to tell me not to tell him but fuck that. Most of you told me to go through with it but through email/letter basically without physical interaction. Even though it was a massive risk, I thought it would be better for me to explain this shit to him in person so I decided to meet him.


I called work explaining I'd be late and then drove over to his workplace around 7:20 am. Then I just went inside and waited in the lobby, watching the door for him to appear. He came in around 8 am and immediately I walked up to him, told him by name I have something important to tell him, and asked if he could meet me after work at a nearby Starbucks. He was perplexed but I convinced him that it's very important and told him not to tell anyone. He agreed, thankfully.


So then I went to my job and went about the day as usual. At 5:30 I was waiting at Starbucks and he came in shortly after. Then the conversation began.


I explained to him that what I was gonna say would crush him and I requested a chance to say my piece without interruption. He allowed this so I told him everything. About how I met his wife, how she used a fake name, the 5 month affair, the lengths she went to to conceal it, everything. For my own safety I emphasized how I didn't know she was married, how I found out about her secret, and how I decided to tell him as soon as I found out. I then handed him a folder containing all of the screenshots. He looked through all of it and then just stared at his coffee in total silence for a minute or two.


He then replied, firstly thanking me for coming to him with this information and for doing the right thing. He said if he were in my position he would have done the same thing. Then he told me how he had suspected his wife was cheating but then his wife lied to him, assuring him nothing was going on.


Then for the next 10 minutes he asked questions about the affair, like about the dates we went on, the sex (she never did anal with him but did it often with me), the conversations we had, etc. I told him the complete truth. By the end of this he was enraged but didn't attack me or anything. Instead he thanked me once more for telling him, and told me I'm a good man. Then he said that although he appreciates me telling him, he told me never to contact him again for obvious reasons. I totally understood and was cool with it.


At this point he was getting up to leave so I asked him what he plans to do. He said he would definitely divorce her and that the screenshots would help him out since they apparently have an infidelity clause in their prenup (she cheated on him at the early stages of their relationship). I was elated to hear this, wished him the best of luck, and we parted ways. I paid for his coffee.


So there it is. Thankfully I escaped unharmed. No injuries, no wounds, nothing. I deleted the cheating bitch's number and cleared my phone of all traces of this shitstorm. I'm proud of what I did and I pray that the cheating bitch faces harsh justice.

So my last post wasn't that big on here, but since a lot of ya'll were very helpful, I wanted to update you guys. 

 I sat my boyfriend down (with a dairy queen blizzard lol) to talk to him about why he stopped going to therapy before we dated, and how his cranky/sad/numb/back to happy days were taking a toll on me, and whether he would consider going to therapy with me. He stopped me there, and told me how he's been feeling the past few months. He told he how exhausted he is from feeling like he's disappointed me. And how he feels like he's walking on egg shells because if he disagrees with me on certain things, I get upset(to clarify- I'm a very sensitive person and if I feel misunderstood in a conversation, I will cry. This has led to him feeling like he can never be blunt or he has to be very careful in how he words things.) Which is totally valid and something I'm gone to therapy for in the past.


It was obvious to me he was wanting to break up from the first few minutes. We spent the next couple hours talking about where we both went wrong and apologized to each other. I told him I was so sorry for making him feel like I wasn't proud of him and made him feel like he couldn't relax or be himself. He told me how sorry he was for letting himself go. He also said he felt like he was holding me back in a lot of ways and that we both seem to be better versions of ourselves when we're by ourselves, which is probably true.


We held each other and cried a lot. He said he has a lot of respect for me and that I was worth every headache and asked me to please never date someone who isn't worthy of my time. I told him if he needed to go to bed or have some alone time to go smoke that was okay, but he said, ""I've left you alone too many times in our relationship. The least I can do is be there for you tonight and hold you."" <<<<<--ughh kill me, i love him so much...


I'm beyond devastated but I know this is for the best in the long run. A relationship shouldn't be this hard 3 years in. I had no idea how much of his unhappiness was due to me. It hurts, but now I know what I need to work on going forward. I deeply appreciate him coming out with the truth and initiating the breakup because if I thought he wanted to stay together, I don't think I could have gone through with it. I'm not strong at all. I just set up an appointment with my therapist. I hope he can give me something to help me sleep the next few months because I'm worried how this will affect my attendance at work and such. I'm currently waiting for him to get off work so we can start deciding who is moving out(i told him he could stay but he may be moving back to the town his family is in so idk) and how we're going to tell people. I'm going to miss him so much. I feel like I'm dying and feel so sick to my stomach but I know it will get better in time. I hope he finds happiness going forward, he definitely deserves it.

416,martin_shillkri,Relationships,aucle3,2396,"Background: I'm a graduate student, just wrapping up my PhD, living in LA. My fianc?e and I have been dating for two years, and engaged for three months. She works in corporate strategy at a big company. Neither of us make a lot of money, we live in a tiny 1 BR/BA.

Recently, one of our friends [27F] started selling jewelry and other little handmade trinkets via an online store (Etsy). It's going well, she's selling about one thing a day and making a bit of money on the side.

I'm pretty sure my fianc?e got envious. She's artsy at heart, and often looked for a side-gig. After our friend started selling crafts, my fianc?e tried her hand at a number of things -- jewelry, pottery, etc. until she settled on paper flowers.

My fianc?e has made _thousands_ of paper flowers over the past two months. 

She's been trying to sell them online, and has gotten some success -- selling a few dollars' worth every day. That wasn't enough though, so she's also been selling them at markets, fairs, and plainly on the streets after work. 

However, the paper flowers don't make much money. Though we're not ""well off"" by any means, she still makes more money at her day job. 

But I've caught her skipping her day job to sell flowers! In the last two weeks, she's actually been taking sick days and ""working from home"" in the mornings, telling her boss she's on calls or stuck in traffic when she's actually spending the first three hours of the day going door-to-door hawking paper flowers.

And don't get me wrong. They're nice flowers. She's doing a great job at making them, and her drive is impressive. But I feel as if it's an obsession that's taking over her life, when she should be prioritizing her real work, and frankly, our relationship. We've been less intimate and have had less time for dates and other fun things because she's always working on the paper flowers. The closest we get these days is when I help her bring flower packages to the post office, or when I'm helping her take photos of the flowers. Stuff like that. I feel like I've become an accessory to her side business (which, I repeat, doesn't actually make much money at all). 

It's had impacts in other ways as well. Hanging out with our friends is a struggle now, because my fianc?e doesn't want to talk about anything but the flowers. She's always carrying some in her purse, showing them off, and if a friend shows only a little bit of interest, my fianc?e will try to sell them some. It's awkward. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm considering taking a break and moving back in with my parents (also in LA) for a few weeks while hoping for her to stabilize. But that seems extreme. What should I do?

**tl;dr original** I had an awful one night stand with this guy Eric. I basically got very drunk and started crying after sex on our first date. Just started a new job, and guess who works with me? Eric. He is telling everyone what happened between us, and I'm very embarrassed.


--------------------------------------------------------------


Thanks to everyone who responded to my original post! Most of you told me to keep my head high, own what happened, and focus on my work, and that's exactly what I did. To those of you reminding me to tell my boyfriend, I actually already had, and he was supportive and sympathetic to my situation.


Anyway, you guys were right, I just had to wait for things to blow over. It's been about two weeks since I posted and one month since I started my new job. I made a really diligent effort to be really helpful, friendly, and hardworking, and it worked! I'm getting along with all my coworkers now, including Eric. I no longer feel paranoid that people are whispering about me being crazy or anything. 


In fact, what inspired me to write this post was that Eric and I had been assigned to tackle a project together. Yesterday we both had to stay late to wrap up a presentation we had been working on for a while, which was the first time we had ever actually been alone (well, besides for the time we had sex). 


I was nervous about it but determined to just focus on work and get through it. But we had a little downtime while we were uploading our presentation/video to the server and we started chatting, at which point I made a self deprecating joke ""If this thing crashes I might just burst into tears again.""


He laughed at that and we ended up clearing the air. He first started by apologizing if he or anyone at work had made me uncomfortable. And then he described our Tinder incident last summer, but from his perspective:


Basically, he had actually just downloaded Tinder that week over the summer when we started talking. I was the first person he had ever talked to or gone on a date with through the app. His work friends were actually the ones who encouraged him to download it, so they knew about me and our planned date almost from the beginning. They were actually the ones who suggested the beer festival. 


So, we have our date and it goes horribly, and of course on Monday everyone is asking him how it goes. And he basically explains to them what happened, and they all laugh off the situation with how awful that must have been, and how it sucks that that was his first date, and maybe Tinder just isn't for him, blahblahblah.


So when I first start working there, they ALL already knew who I was, from way back summer. Which is actually kind of a relief, because it means that Eric didn't immediately see me and spill the beans to everyone like some jerk. 


Eric and I then cleared the air and said that from getting to know me over the last month I seem very cool and professional, and he hopes that there is no ill will between us. I said definitely not, I don't blame him for what happened. I explained very briefly about how I was just in a bad place when I met him that summer from losing my job, and just drank too much, and he said not to worry about it and he totally understands. I'm just glad we were able to address the elephant in the room. 


Also, about the one friend I had made previously who told me what Eric was saying. She actually is relatively new to the office also, and *wasn't* around last summer when this Tinder thing happened. So from her perspective, it looked like Eric was spreading a fresh rumor, when in actuality people were discussing stuff they already had known. 


So yeah! Things are good!

So long story short, he isn't coming. He is now saying that he's afraid to get on the boat or he has also said he doesn't want to be on a boat with my mother.

The actual wedding ceremony is just over a month away. Everything has been purchased and the final touches are being taken care of.

419,lottowinerthrowaway,? Locked Post ?,34zqre,2393,"Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting an update, I have quite a few messages asking me how I'm doing, so I thought I'd post here on what's going on. 

I realised people were trying to figure out where I came from, since the dialect or the tone of my writing is a bit off. I actually have a bit of a learning disability, so my partner comes on and sort of corrects things for me. 

The original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xpni7/

Well, we ended up having to move, which is no problem to be honest. It was the safer route for our little family that's growing. We also installed extra security and have contacted police, schools, neighbours, etc. I'll tell you the story. 

First of all, I'm just going to say that I stopped talking to my sister. She's acting as if she did nothing wrong, but she knows what she did.

So about a month and a half ago, we had already started packing, since we were moving away. My dad texted me and asked if I wanted to meet up, just myself. I said no at first, because I knew that he was going to try and yell at me again for not giving him any money, as well as my grandma. (I looked into /r/raisedbynarcissists that was suggested by some people since he tries to gaslight me a lot.) He then ended up writing an email and apologised for everything he had said and done on his and grandma's behalf. I was actually surprised my dad was apologising for the first time in his life. He then asked if we could meet again, so I caved in and met him. We went to a cafe and I had a really nice time talking to him, yet I felt a bit off. We were probably sitting there talking for about an hour. He was checking his phone a lot. 

After we left, I went straight home (my partner had our son with him) and found that the property we were living in at the time had been broken into. I realised at that point that dad used me as a sort of.. decoy or something. I called the police immediately and told them that we have secret installation and camera's, so we'l be able to see who did what and when. They scanned the house with a German Shepard dog, and had an inspection and investigation. Meanwhile, I contacted my partner and then went down to the police station with them. They started watching the videos, and behold, it was my own fucking grandmother. I guess she doesn't need that knee surgery then.. I asked the officers what I could do and like many suggested in the first post, they suggested a restraining order, specifically a protection order straight away.  I had the evidence. I was so round up, I just wanted to call my dad and fucking yell at him because I knew he and grandma planned this together. I decided not to because that could jeopardise things in court. They ended up stealing my jewellery and my partner's oculus. (no idea why..) I told my partner to store it away properly, but he didn't. The police officer asked me why I didn't want to press charges on them for slashing my tires and stealing my mail. I said I had the benefit of the doubt about them, but I was wrong..

The police found my grandmother and father around my property and arrested them. They were standing there pretending to be worried and sad that the house was broken into. My dad went to trial. He couldn't afford a lawyer so he had a public defender. My father is to be sentenced to 4 years in prison for robbing our house. I ended up finding out that he did a home invasion many years ago, went to prison and then came out and flew to his home country after his parole ended. I was taken back by all of this. My grandma is currently in hospital, because she actually did hurt her knee and leg from breaking into our house.

 At least right now, I have a protection order against them. They cannot come near me or my family, or the property. 

As for my partner and my son, I apologised to him and said I shouldn't have met my dad. He understood and just said that it's normal to crave love. I'm really honestly heartbroken that my family would do this to me, but at least we've moved into a better property, I can get the therapy I need and I can focus on my new family.

Thanks for reading.

So in case anyone is wondering turns out my (now) ex's mother and two sisters had him convinced I had some kind of eating disorder and would nag at him about it and make him feel like crap for ""letting"" me hurt myself. All three of them are obese so idk why he weighed their opinion on nutrition so heavily. I pointed that out (with more tact) and we had a much better conversation about why he needed to lay off on how I eat. He did make a lot of effort to keep his opinions to himself but could never completely let his worry go. 


Officially this isn't why we broke up but it was kind of like the shattering illusion from HIMYM that kind of made me start noticing how he's quick to be arrogant, condescending, and patronizing when he thinks he's right and how he buys into every dumb thing his family tells him without question.

421,James19104,Non-Romantic,4jbh6t,2386,"My dad married my step mother 3 months ago and I feel like it made my life significantly harder and less pleasant. They moved in with us and for the indefinite future this situation will not change.

We have a 3 bedroom house and before they moved in, my dad and I had our rooms (both with bathrooms) and there was a smaller room which was a study for my dad. After they moved in, Jenny [16F, turning 17 next month] got my room, and I had to share the smaller room with Tom [11M] and Mike [10M]. All my books, my telescope, my stuff are packed and in the basement now since there's no space anymore. This made me real angry but my dad told me that I have to be a team player and this is what him and his wife agreed on.

Jenny treats me like shit. She sometimes acts as if I'm not there at all, and sometimes is super aggressive and hostile towards me. The other I asked Tom to stop going through my things and she became so angry that ""I have no right to order her brother around"", she told me to get it in my thick scull that I'm not their big brother to tell them what to do, even though all I asked was for them to stop going through my things. She said it's best if I don't talk to them at all since that way they will get less influence from a weirdo like me. What I don't get is that if she's so concerned that I might leave a bad influence on Tom and Mike why doesn't she take them into her room?

Tom and Mike don't respect any boundaries. They're always through my stuff. I have a watch which was a gift from my mother (she died of cancer) and they took it from my drawer and lost it. I found it weeks later in the basement with its front glass broken. 

Before they moved in I used to get a $100 allowance every month. Now Jenny gets $75, I get $35 and Tom and Mike each get $30. I had an Xbox but these kids broke it down.

I used to spend a lot of time with my dad. He used to come see me play basketball almost every week, he hasn't done it even once in the past three months since he's always working overtime. We eat out once a week and none of them in these three months have been to any of my favorite places, but Jenny, Tom and Mike have each chosen their favorites more than once. 

I complained about all of it to my father last week and he told me that family is all about sacrifices, and I have to make mine. Haven't I made enough sacrifices already? I feel like I'm the only one making sacrifices. I looked forward to them moving in here but I now feel like an outsider at home, it's not my home anymore.

Life has become very difficult for me. I spend as much time as I can outside because inside is so frustrating but this is causing problems as well. My dad keeps telling me that not being around means I'm not accepting them as part of the family while in reality it's the opposite. So I get grounded for not being around, and being around is horrible. 

I don't want to live here anymore but I'm only 15 and can't move out. I have nobody else who can take me in. I can't stay here for 3 more years. I'll go crazy. I often fantasize about running away at night but I know that's also as horrible if not even more.

I don't know what to do. Can anyone give me a suggestion?

SO, after confirming that my relationship was a massive communication disaster, I am writing this update to you all after a week of couples therapy with Ashley. I'm going to share what we have learned about each other. 


To start with me: I am way too ""chill"" in relationships. I've always been this way with everyone. Nothing ever bothers me, I go with the flow really easily, I react minimally to unexpected situations. While this is a blessing in some ways, it turns out Ashley had a really hard time with this. Since I never fought or had any issues with her, she felt like SHE couldn't bring up any issues with me. She basically did not want to always be the one starting fights (or even, I guess, discussions). 


It also was (surprise) a HUGE fault of mine to never tell my girlfriend, who I love deeply, that I loved her. I should not have presumed we were equally nonverbal, especially after two years. And, more importantly, it's not OKAY for me to be this nonverbal. Communication skills are something I am severely lacking. 




Now, on to her: As it turns out, in her last THREE relationships, Ashley said I love you first. All three times, it turned out poorly for her. They didn't say it back, or they said it without really meaning it, and they ended up leaving her. That's why she never said it to me. She had actually been making a really big effort to also be ""chill"" because she didn't want me to react poorly to her. But, as it is clear now, she was just not being herself at all. I understand and empathize with this.


After this blowup, Ashley now realizes that it was a mistake for her to keep her mouth shut and be silently stewing for YEARS. There was no reason to be so passive aggressive. 



Additionally, proposing to somebody without having a thorough discussion of marriage and our future was a mistake. I thought it was a romantic gesture, but it was really a sign of poor planning and lack of communication.


Our therapist has given us homework. She has basically told us that we, daily, have to ""check in"" with each other. We need to assign a time to voice our concerns about each other, share how we feel about each other, talk about how we can improve our relationship. ""I love you"" will now be a frequent exchange.


Once we get into the habit of doing some mandatory communication, it should come more naturally to us in the future. For now, all weddings and proposals are going to be put on hold. We're nowhere near ready to be married until we figure out ourselves and our relationship better. 


For now, we are both happy and relieved that we are taking positive steps towards improving our relationship. It's clear (and now stated) that we both love each other very much.

Okay wow! So I want to start off saying how much I appreciate all your feedback and support! I did read **every** comment in the thread! I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did but the support has helped me in many ways!

I talked to my boyfriend last night after we had settled in, ate dinner, and relaxed. I asked if I could talk to him about something and just told him ""I really don't like it when you come up to me and say things about my body like 'hey babe you need to hit the gym, when are you going to do squats, etc'. It's not very nice and I don't say things like that to you.""

I could see the gears turning in his head and he really did seem surprised it bothered me so much. He apologized profusely and told me he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thinks I am beautiful and he loves everything about me. I told him I appreciated his apology and that pretty much summed up the conversation. He apologized again a little bit later so I think it was still on his mind.

So that was that. It truly was as simple as most of you told me it should be. However this has brought my relationship with my dad to my attention and made me realize why I put up with those comments from my boyfriend for so long. I really have been conditioned to brush those things off because of the reaction I expect when I say something about them. Habits die hard I guess!

I put a lot of thought into how to handle the situation if my boyfriend did anything but apologize. I plan on using those ideas and what I have taken from my last thread to confront my dad. Next time he says something rude about me or one of my siblings I plan on asking him why he does it and telling him I don't like it. When he tells me it's a joke I will tell him it isn't funny. I will ask him if a joke is really worth damaging his relationship with his family. I have realized that I have to approach this situation differently than I have before and I hope in resonates with my dad.

I do want to say my dad is not a bad person. He is definitely an asshole sometimes but he is a product of circumstance and there is a lot going on in our lives. This is no excuse for the mean things he says but I do want you all to know that he loves his family deeply and has sacrificed all of himself to keep our heads above water. I wouldn't trade him for the world!

My boyfriend is also not a bad person. He does stupid things and so do I but we do love each other. It's always easy to demonize someone by getting only one perspective and knowing nothing about the people involved. While it will never be okay to say things like that to someone, when his comments initially started I did not properly communicate with him about how it made me feel and by laughing it off I was condoning it. I know why now, but that also doesn't excuse my poor communication with my boyfriend. I will learn from this!

I will add in that I of course expect him to follow through with this apology. Sorry only counts if your actions reflect it as well. I don't expect to encounter this problem again but I do know how I will handle it if I have to, thanks to you all!

So I do want to end with another thank you! Sometimes the psychology behind small problems can reveal large problems and it takes a lot of support to face those! All of you that take time to think critically about other's problems and type up advice are really doing something great!

I learned a lot through your responses. I decided that I would fully accept my boyfriend for who he is, and that I can't change him. 


Things since then have been great. We had a talk where I told him that I love and fully accept him no matter what. I made it clear that it's not my place to try and change him and that I would support him. He decided to seek out help on his own accord. I found out later that he was concerned as to why he was feeling the way he was. He ended up being diagnosed with depression and anxiety and his current treatment plan is going really well. He stopped smoking and made lifestyle changes too, in order to live as healthy as he can. He still seeks out experiences that give him an adrenaline rush which I am happy about because it makes him happy. We've started doing adrenaline junkie activities together and fully understand the risks. We recently celebrated our anniversary by conquering some class 5 rapids while whitewater rafting a few weeks ago and it was so exciting! 


I have also taken steps to deal with my anxiety. Therapy is helping me a lot. Things are going a lot better for me too. Any disagreements we've had over anything have been minor and are always resolved on the spot. Thank you /r/relationships for helping me see a different perspective and for overall just being awesome!

Well its a month since my first post, and the guys gone thankfully, however my sister and I still moved out, for a number of reasons.

It all came to a head a few weeks ago when my mum was out of the house, and her boyfriend was hanging about the house.  I was in my room and I heard my sister scream, it came from the bathroom.  She was freaking out, saying he was hitting on her and touching her/trying to touch her and she had told him to stop and he wouldn't back off, so she screamed at the top of her lungs for me to come.  He was denying everything, saying she was making it all up, saying she was overreacting.  I told him he had to leave the house immediately or I was calling the police, he wouldn't, and I basically pushed him out while my sister called our dad.  When he heard her calling our dad, he finally left the house, still insisting we were the crazy ones and he had done nothing.  I reassured my sister, she was in a very shocked state, my dad came over and we comforted her and helped her feel better.  He called mum and she came back and we all explained the situation to her.

That was the last time we ever saw mum's creepy boyfriend, he broke up with her shortly afterwards. I don't know why, but I guess after that situation, he didn't want to come back ever and had no interest in our mum.  I'm really scared that he was maybe just pursuing our mother to get close to sis the entire time and had no real intentions for our mother.  My sister was kind of traumatised by the whole ordeal, and I convinced our dad to sleep with us for a few nights at our place just to be safe and so my sister could feel safe.

Naturally mum was upset by how everything turned, but we convinced her it was for the better that he was gone, and we finally got her to accept and admit he was a creep all along and should never have been allowed in our house.

Unfortunately, family problems didn't end there.  My sister was way on edge for the next week, way more cranky and irritable than usual, I didn't blame her.  She still wanted to move out, she said she hated living at home after everything that happened, she didn't feel safe.  I told her the dude wasn't coming back, but she still wanted me to move out with her.  She said stuff like ""you don't really love me, I knew it, I don't love you either"", stuff like that which was clearly attempting to guilt me and which I felt was extremely childish and immature.

Unfortunately our mum wasn't too helpful either.  A couple of weeks later, she was already dating a completely new boyfriend.  We didn't see much of this one, but from what I did see here and there, he seems nice enough and not too creepy.  Unfortunately mum started acting the same way again, telling my sister her clothing is too revealing, telling her to wear a bra, telling her to cover up in her own home, even when it was just the three of us around.

I agreed to move out with my sister, and I talked the whole situation over with both our parents and told them of our plan.  My sister and I would borrow some money from mum and some from dad, both of which we intended to pay back in full as soon as we could.  We stayed a couple of days at dad's place, and from there we moved out into our own small place.  Its small sure, but pretty good considering its within our affordability range.  Things are going good so far, and we're moving forward.

426,Throwawayavegan,Non-Romantic,42vdem,2376,"As the title states, I have this vegan coworker (we'll call her Vegan) who is very active on FB and in the office about being vegan and how cruel farming is and everything.

Each to their own. I don't necessarily disagree with her views on animal cruelty but here's the thing, I'm a hunter. Not a trophy hunter but I do shoot feral pigs, rabbits, ducks (introduced, classified game ducks) and foxes and I fish too.

All except for the fish are classified as pests, foxes especially kill native wildlife and farm animals and farmers will often put you up on their property for free to hunt them.

I have passed tests here, especially for identification of game ducks vs protected species and practice ethical hunting, i.e. allow the animal to have a fair chase, no dogs or tracking devices, practicing marksmanship and dispatching prey swiftly and humanely and not wasting the meat.

None of that is obviously good enough for Vegan. When she first came onto the team and told everyone she was vegan, I kept my mouth shut about my hunting. I also think she's really intolerant because she preaches to people about how going vegan will help with their various ailments and always turns up her nose at people heating up meat in microwave. As a result, we've kind of consciously started excluding her when we get up for lunch.

However last year I started going hunting more regularly with a work friend from another department whose uncle owns a farm where feral pigs and like are an issue and he often swings by to have a chat about guns/bows and our next trip and she found out I was a hunter. This isn't even at our desks, it's in the kitchen area that has tables and stuff, we sometimes eat our lunches together.

Ever since then, every conversation I've had with her, she's referred to hunting and how cruel it is. 

One time, I wore a leather pencil skirt to work and she had a go at me for wearing animal products. She seems to have singled me because of the fact that I go hunting.

My boss has no spine, I've tried talking to him about this, but she just intimidates him and makes it seem like she's been persecuted and he's back down from that.

She even tried to get a ""vegan"" shelf in the fridge and tried to rope in some Hindu vegetarian guys to do that but they pointed out that they use milk and cheese and honey in their cooking. They also think she's nuts. 

It's gotten to the point where we go out for drinks on a Friday night at 5 and we never ask her. I don't organize these things, a coworker does but my boss told me, when I brought it up in one on one meeting, that she feels really left out and she seems to think it's my fault because I've been here for longer and I'm somehow poisoning them against her or something.

I have since been conscious of this if anyone starts conversation about Vegan, I just say I don't talk to her unless it's work related and she's more than adequate at her job. It's actually become something of a joke or ""catchphrase"".

I told my boss I don't organize anything except official events and she's always been invited. If she's not invited to informal stuff, that's not even organized by me, then that's not my problem. The coworker that doesn't invite her, she managed to piss him off because he's eaten guinea pig (he's from Peru) and she asked him if he'd eaten any of his other pets. For the record, he never ate a guinea pig that was a pet, it's something they eat in Peru.

Whenever she brings up hunting or anything, I just point blank ask her there was anything work related that she wanted to talk about, and if there wasn't, I would start talking to someone else or just walk off. I have asked her multiple times to keep conversations work related. I never start a conversation with her at all.

Most of the time, she pounces when I'm in the kitchen making tea, getting water or just stretching my legs.

One time last week, a group of us were talking and she got up join the discussion. A horrible silence fell over the group to the point where I just excused myself and went to me desk and so did a few others.

It all came to a head in our team meeting today when our boss, usually at the ends asks if there's any positive news or celebrations outside of work people want to share like engagements, marathons, charity appeals etc and Vegan sarcastically asked me how many ""lives I'd taken last weekend"".

I got annoyed and said her constant badgering me about my hobbies and choice to eat meat was discriminatory and bothersome and that unless it was work related, she was not to engage me in conversation otherwise and told our ""scribe"" to put that in the meeting minutes.

She seemed a bit shocked by that and my boss looked uncomfortable but said fair enough. I thought that was the end of that but the right before our boss went to close the meeting, 2 other coworkers also put their hands up and asked Vegan to only engage them in work related discussions and that they were also uncomfortable being given non-medical health advice pertaining to their choice to consume meat and their diets. Again boss looked uncomfortable but asked Vegan to respect their wishes and closed the meeting.

Vegan didn't look anyone in the eye after that but headed straight to the bathroom. My boss was trying to get one of the coworkers to see if she was OK and I think one of them eventually checked up on her but she was in a cubicle and asked to be left alone. She eventually came out and asked my boss to leave early which she did. 

I feel awful now. She embarrassed me in front of my team with the ""lives taken"" comment so I pushed back but I am caught between not wanting her to miserable and not wanting anything to do with her at all.

A few of my coworkers and I ended up in a proactive conference call after this with HR who basically said that always been subjected to unwanted advice and jabs about eating meat was not OK but some ""mediation"" was in order to ensure cut the tension in the workplace.

The HR rep then called my boss who explained what happened in the team meeting and complaints that we'd made one on one etc but then he went into a meeting room and didn't hear the rest of discussion.

I don't know what to do, assuming she comes into work tomorrow or if I should even talk to her at all. 

TLDR: Vegan coworker keeps making jabs at me, I snapped and told her not to talk to me unless it was work related and 2 other coworkers followed suit. Vegan left work early upset.

Thank you all for your comments, I really appreciate it.

I apologize if any of this seems rambling or disjointed, but I just got back, and I want to write all this down before I forget.


I called John today, and told him that I would like to talk to him alone.  He invited me over, and we talked over coffee.


When I told him what had happened with his son, he seemed shocked, but he took it well.  He said that he was surprised, as James had not been displaying anything in the way of sexually inappropriate behavior, though he did admit he had been told that James acting out sexually was a possibility, so it wasn't entirely unexpected.


He said that he wished I had come forward after the hallway incident, but that he understood why I had brushed it off, and didn't hold it against me.  He's just glad that I came forward and told him the truth.  I was visibly upset, so I'm sure he could tell how deeply this was affecting me.  I asked him if he wanted me to cut ties with them, temporarily or permanently, but he said absolutely not.  He believes that it's important for James to have a gay role model in his life, and felt that not having me around would come across as punitive and shaming to James, and would end up doing more harm than good.  He confirmed to me that James is seeing a therapist, but that they were down to monthly visits, as James had seemed to be adjusting well.  John said that he was going to go back to weekly visits in light of his behavior.  He asked me to stick around until James got home.

When James arrived, John said that he wanted to talk to him about what had happened between James and I.  James looked extremely guilty, and started tearing up.  After John reiterated what had happened and asked if he had anything he'd like to say, James broke down crying and saying how sorry he was.  We both reassured him that we weren't angry with him, and that he wasn't in any trouble, but that he needed to understand that this behavior was inappropriate, and why.  As per the suggestion of several of the comments, I apologized for saying he should never touch anyone the way he did, and we discussed the issue of consent at length.  John then asked him why he did what he did.


James talked a lot about it, but was rambling nervously.  I get the feeling that he was sorting it out in his head as he was talking, so it was a little difficult to follow, but I'll paraphrase what he said, as I understand it.


He confirmed for us that he had not done this with anyone else.  He has had a brief crush or two on other boys at school, but was self-aware enough to know that they were straight, and not interested in him romantically.  He admitted that he did have a little bit of a crush on me as well, but assumed that I was straight.


However, when he found out that I was gay, he mistook my affection for him as attraction, and came to the conclusion that I was only friendly with him because I wanted him sexually.  John asked him if he acted the way he had because he wanted to have sex with me.  James said no, but that he thought that if he didn't repay my affection with sexual acts that I wouldn't want to be his friend anymore.  He also expressed some concern that if he didn't initiate it I would, and that he'd rather do it on his terms.  I told him that sex was never any part of my intentions, and that I was friends with him because he was nice, that I enjoyed talking to him and hanging out with him, that I like him because of who he is as a person.  He asked if he was ugly.  I said no, and explained that most people are attracted to people close to their own age.  He admitted that if he were to have a boyfriend that he'd want a boyfriend his age.


We started wrapping things up, but I noticed James seemed dejected.  I asked him what was wrong.   He asked me if I hated him now.  I admit I got a little choked up when he said that.  I gave him a big hug and told him that I would never hate him, and that I would always be his friend.  He asked if we would still get to hang out, and I said yes, but only when his father was home, and that I wouldn't be able to babysit for him for awhile.  John made sure he understood that this was not a punishment, just a precaution.  James seemed agreeable to it.

At this point, John said he had some things he wanted to discuss with James privately, so we said our goodbyes, and I left.

All in all I feel pretty good about it.  I think we were able to explain things to James in a way that he understood.  I hope I handled this the right way.


I'd like to wrap this up by thanking everyone for their comments, but especially /u/Doughchild for their heartbreaking, but very insightful comments in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/me_25m_and_my_friend_27m_of_fifteen_years_his_son/cuwe8kq)  I read it again just now, and started crying, because I was struck by how much of that I saw in James.  Thank you for helping me understand.

**tl;dr original:** Grew up taking care of my family and household duties. I moved out and my home has become a mess. No one realized how much I cleaned up around the house until I was gone, and now my mom wants me to move back.


-----------------------------------------------------------


I was kind of surprised by how much everyones response to my mother was a resounding no. It made me feel silly for even considering it; there was really no benefit to keep enabling my mom and move back home.


Well, Reddit, I'm sad to say that turning my mom down was the first time I had ever really stood up to her, and it did not go well. She instantly starting gulit tripping me -- how she had raised me, how family was everything, how I was being selfish and abandoning her


When that didn't work, her insults turned more aggressive. She said I owed her money -- the money it cost to raise me, put me through college (my parents paid partial tuition), the accumulation of ""rent"" for letting me live at home during college (at no point had we ever discussed this), etc. Again, she pressed that I was taking advantage of the family by not moving back home and helping out.


I don't wanna get into much detail because I am still very, very sad about how this has turned out, but my mom hasn't responded to my calls in weeks. She's antagonized me against the whole family, telling my siblings that I did something ambiguously terrible and am abandoning the family. I had a phone conversation with my sister Rachel, who said something along the lines of ""mom said you did something really mean to her, she won't tell us what, but she said that's why she made you move out."" I've never been really close to my siblings, but I'm kind of taken aback how little anyone seems to care that I'm gone.


Recently my mom put up a picture on Facebook of the whole family, with me absent, captioned ""The only people in my life I'll ever need.""


I'm trying to focus on my work and my friends to get through this, but I am in a very sad place right now.

429,mykidisnotfat,Updates,507dgm,2375,"Hi Reddit. I'm back with an update. Here's the original post. https://redd.it/4zn8ly

Thanks for all the responses you gave me on my first post. I think I needed a dose of reality, and that's what I got. 

After reading all the comments I realized I needed to talk to my mom. So when she came over, before she had a chance to say anything about Leah's eating habits, I took her aside and said ""enough. Leah is healthy and happy, and your weight comments are inappropriate. They stress me out and they're bad for Leah. If you keep making them, we're just not going to see you anymore."" She sputtered a bit, but ultimately agreed to my terms. I was hopeful that maybe she would actually stop making the comments so we could have a somewhat normal relationship and she could continue to see Leah.

Hahaha.

I work a part-time schedule of two days per week and every other weekend. This was my working weekend, so my husband was home with Leah. When I got home after work on Sunday, I could tell something was up. Leah was already in bed, and my husband looked really tense. He's usually a pretty laid back guy, so this was weird. 

When I asked what was up, he said we needed to talk about my mother. I had told him that I had spoken with her and that she had been warned not to make any more comments about Leah's weight. Well, apparently she just couldn't do it, because she called him (knowing I was at work) that day and told him that I was blind to Leah's problem and that he needed to get involved because I had confided in her that Leah's pediatrician told me she was at serious risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and that we needed to change her diet so she would lose weight.

What?!?

For the record, Leah's pediatrician has never said anything like that. In fact, as I mentioned in my last post, he has told me that she is underweight. Fortunately, my husband a) attends all Leah's doctor appointments and b) has the sense to realize that a rail-thin child isn't edging toward obesity, so he knew it was bunk. He told my mom that she wasn't to call again until she heard from me.

Well, I was livid. It was like after years and years of weight-related crap from my mom something finally snapped. I called her and the minute she said ""hello"" I just lit into her. I told her that based on her behavior she was either delusional or a manipulative sociopath, and that either way she wasn't allowed around me or my kid again. I told her she was not welcome to call, e-mail, come over or send cards. Basically, we were going to pretend like she didn't exist. I hung up before she had a chance to get a word in edgewise.

She called fifteen times that night. I finally blocked her number on my cell and my husband's (we don't have a landline so this means she can't call us at all). I had three emails in my inbox the next morning, which I deleted without reading before blocking her email address as well. Finally, we had given her a key to our house for emergency purposes so first thing yesterday I had the locks changed then took Leah out for the day. Lo and behold, when we came home my neighbor said that my mom (she recognizes her because she used to come over a lot) had been banging on the door for almost half an hour earlier that day before storming off in a huff. I can only imagine how angry she was when she realized her key didn't work anymore.

I feel better than I have in years, which makes me think I did the right thing. The only thing I'm still struggling with is how to break the news to Leah. She really does love grandma. My husband and I are going to sit down with her tonight, so I guess I have until then to figure out what to say.

Original tl;dr He was dating someone for 4 months before me and started dating me after 2 months of that breakup...is this a red flag?
EDIT: After reading all the replies, I have come to the conclusion that I need to have a serious talk to him to slow things down( he set the wedding for April next year) I m thinking of giving back the ring

So I talked to him Saturday night, it took everything I got and I was scared. I eased him by starting to talk about what we each wanted in terms of career path, where we want to live, kids etc...found out that he wants four and I only want one lol.After the light talk, I expressed my concerns that we might be rushing things, and I gave him his ring back...he started to cry and at first I was starting to feel really guilty, he was going nuts and I was a little scared but I was able to calm him down. I told him that we should call off the wedding and that didn't go down well, he called me names and claimed that I didn't really love him. I told him I want to work things out, that we can be together but not married for now, not engaged. He said that he needs space and time to think, it has been almost 3 days now and he won't talk to me, won't answer my text and he won't see me. His mom has been posting stuff on his facebook wall about relationships and stuff. I reached out to the girl he was dating for 4 months before we started dating 2 months later and she told me that he had proposed to her and that is why the broke up, with the same ring he claimed to have bought for me using his savings...needless to say, I feel gutted, should have probably contacted the ex-first but I didn't want to be that guy and I was in love. I still have feelings for him, just can't turn them off but I now know that being with him will bring me tears, I am tempted to try to salvage the relationship but I won't be, going to take time for myself away from everything.Thank you so much to everyone who answered on my post, this has been a very sobering experience and I hope to grow from it. I really appreciate all the replies, it made me feel like I was not crazy for all the concerns I had been having.

Trying again to submit this as the one I did this morning was removed and never showed up after.


Nobody specifically asked for an update but I know readers of this sub like to see them and my post got a lot more comments and upvotes than I expected so here I am. I'm sorry I didn't reply to any of the comments on the original post, it blew up a bit and you guys seemed to cover all the bases. I read all the comments two or three times, thanks Reddit. The only question I remember seeing is how did she get my contact information, the answer is that while I have my ex blocked on Facebook due to repeated attempts to contact me a couple of years ago, I am still easily searchable by others and have an uncommon name. Also, a couple people thought that she was only 20 years old, but what I meant in the title was that I assumed she was in her 20s but wasn't sure of her age. She was not that young.


I did write the girl back and essentially said that I was sorry she was going through such a hard time, that my relationship with my ex was a really hard time in my life, that she must be in a rough spot to reach out to me of all people, and that I'd be happy to talk with her any way she was comfortable if she needed.


She wrote me back and asked to meet in person. My SO (like some of you) was a little paranoid that it was some kind of set up or that my ex would show up so I made sure it was in a public place and he was nearby in case I needed help. Nothing dramatic like that happened, sorry /r/relationships :P


Without going in to too much detail of her personal life.. The short story is from what she has said, he hasn't changed a bit. Some of the manipulation tactics he used he must have found from a script somewhere or something, it was word for word. He had been gaslighting her BIG TIME and that is essentially why she reached out to me, to see if she was really crazy and a bad girlfriend or if he was like this to me too. I tried to keep it to the facts, told some stories that I felt like she needed to hear to compare our situations. I had no intentions of telling her what I thought she should do, just to give her the information I had and let her make her decision, but that kind of went to the wayside. When she told me that things had started to get slightly physical, I told her in no uncertain terms that she needed to get out as soon as possible and that it would probably get worse. I told her that if one of my girlfriends came to me with something like this we wouldn't be sitting there anymore, that I'd be packing her shit for her. She admitted that he had isolated her from a lot of her friends and that none of them knew how bad it really was.


She seemed resolved to get out of the situation. I know it's easy to say these things in the heat of the moment but she must have known that the prognosis of their relationship wasn't good considering it had already reached a point where she was sitting across from his ex from three years ago. I told her how relieved I was when we finally broke up for good, that aside from some initial anxiety about running into him I felt really free and that the relationships I've pursued since then have been night and day and made me embarrassed that I put up with him for so long. She asked me what she could expect when she leaves him, which I thought was very smart of her to ask, and I told her what he had been like for me. I advised her to use her support system to get out safely, and to go no contact immediately. I told her some of the things he used to say to me to get me to think he was going to change and not to believe a word of it.


My SO was extremely sweet, while he initially raised an eyebrow at the situation and said he wondered why I'd get involved, he supported me once I said that if there was a chance I could help someone who might really be in a bad situation I should do it. 


I hope she can get out of this situation and never look back.

I asked about going to a halloween party last week, that I was supposed to go to with my ex. I was getting social anxiety about the whole thing. I was scared of being surrounded by couples and being reminded of him.

Anyways, I went. The friend who invited me actually went with me. Even though it was her boyfriend's party, she told me, if I wanted to leave anytime I could. We agreed to go and see how we feel and if I wasn't feeling it, we'd go back to her place for a chill night of scary movies and junk food. We went and I had a blast! No social anxiety whatsoever. I didn't even have to drink a lot to calm my nerves. I made new friends. Became closer to people I met in the past once or twice.

Best part is, I didn't think about my ex even once at the party. I was too busy having a good time. Thanks to everyone who advised me to go and try to have fun. So glad I did :) 

EDIT: I wish I could respond to everyone, but sincerely, thank you so much :) I was having a tough few days but you guys have put a smile on my face. And yes, my friend is an amazing human and I am so grateful to have her.

So he came home last night and I pretended to be asleep. I didn?t know what else to do, I felt paralysed. Then very early this morning he was looking at me suspiciously, telling me I seem very nervous which made me feel even more unnerved because I wondered if he knew what was going on. I was shaking and he asked ?Why are you being like this? It?s like you think I?m going to hit you or something.? That triggered something in me. I thought ?this is it, I?m trapped? and I broke down crying, leading him to storm into the bedroom, slamming the door.   

&nbsp;

But then a little while later he opened the door and asked me to come in. His mood had done a complete 180 and he was almost too calm?possibly even sad? Out of the blue he says we couldn?t go on like this anymore, he says I?m crying all the time, too negative, and ?discussing? too much (read: questioning his behaviour too much.) He said that he realised two days ago, in a meditation, that it isn?t our destiny to be together. He said I?m not the person he had created in his brain when he met me. His exact words were ?I created an angel and then you opened your mouth.? He said he?s losing more patience with me every second and even though I?ve done a lot for him, it?s not enough because he says he loves himself and is happy all the time so he needs someone who is the same, as well as a ?real woman? (cooking and cleaning every day.) He said his brain is crazy around me and he can?t deal with it anymore. His parting words were ?Believe in yourself. Love yourself.? I found myself getting more upset and more confused but instead of following my inclination to bargain with him (I know, I truly can?t explain it) I tried to remember the things I had read on here and played along just in case this was some kind of test or manipulative behaviour. 

&nbsp;

I packed as quickly as I could, though it was in a daze so I?m pretty sure I?ve left things behind. The whole time I was packing he stayed sitting on the bed just staring at the wall, the same position, not moving once? and then I left. No fight. No struggle. No words. Nothing. I felt paranoid waiting for something to happen, for him to react, I don?t know, for some kind of trap, but no. I simply walked away. I was thinking all night about which exit strategy to use but he made it so easy? He, in essence, was the one to let me go? I?m not complaining but Jesus, has it confused me all the more.

&nbsp;

My mum knows everything (I sent the link to this post as suggested.) She?s absolutely mortified but just wants to get me home. She has booked me on a flight back to England for this evening and stayed with me on the phone while I found a taxi to get me to the airport. I have a long time to wait but my mum said she?d rather know that I?m at an airport surrounded by people rather than being anywhere near him. So I thought I?d use this opportunity to update you all because you?ve all been so supportive, **I?m really overwhelmed by all the messages and advice, I wasn't expecting it. Really, thank you for your kindness.**

&nbsp;

Right now I am just sitting in the airport, shell-shocked, wondering what the hell just happened. I read my original post again and know I haven?t exaggerated a thing. Everything happened exactly as I said. Actually, more than those 26 things happened. If anything I omitted detail in an attempt to keep the post short.  But the way he acted this morning wasn?t what I was expecting and from reading your replies, it?s not what you were expecting either and so it has completely thrown me off guard. Honestly, I feel almost ashamed to tell you all what happened in case you also find it odd and question me, like I am questioning myself right now. I know it doesn?t excuse everything he has done but does it give you a different perspective on things? Does this say more about me than it does him? Or is it manipulation to put the blame on me? I know he cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of him, he wants to be idolised too much. Maybe it?s from speaking to his friend. Or maybe I really am at fault and have been all along, because I keep thinking that if he is that controlling then why wouldn?t he try to keep me there? Unless he realised he couldn?t control me the way he expected.

&nbsp;

Please don?t shoot me down for saying these things, I?m just?I don?t know!? I don?t understand the way this has panned out, and I?m desperately trying to make sense out of it. I feel like a TV crew are going to walk out at any moment telling me this has all been some kind of sick joke. I?m not purposefully trying to sound like a na?ve idiot, I?m just finding it extremely hard to think logically or think at all for that matter. **I mean his last words to me were that he wants me to believe in myself and love myself for Christ sake.** I feel so confused and ashamed. My brain has whiplash from being on the rollercoaster of his multifaceted personality and feels even more scrambled right now. Nothing is really sinking in.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l093t/my_32f_girl_scout_leader_32f_stole_all_of_the/)

Most of you urged me to go to the police and file a report. Well I did, but the officer that talked with me said I shouldn't file a police report yet and should contact Candie and try to procure the money from her to show that when I do file a police report I can show them that I made every attempt to get it from her and that she is aware of the theft. So, I messaged her:

""Candie, in the month of March our Girl Scouts' bank account was drained. I went to the bank and have account statements and withdrawal slips showing that you made unauthorized withdrawals from the account. If you do not restore the account I will be filing a police report on June 1st to protect myself and the girls""

Her response:

""I will be restoring it no worries. It was not all me but I will be replacing it because I am the one who lost the information. But thank you. I am putting in a certain amount each month towards both girl scouts and the bank. But thank you, I got what you are saying.""

My response:

""I spoke with the branch manager at the bank. They have evidence that it was you. I have had a bank account there for over a decade, they require you to show proper ID when you withdraw money from the account. Also, there are cameras outside and inside the building.""

Candie's response:

""Well without going into my personal information, I do not remember it, but I am being treated for it. Acknowledged my mistake and will take care of it. It will all be paid to the GS council before August 1st and the remainder of the money is accounted for between my trip to the council shop and the stuff I will be purchasing for the water park. My first payment to them is June first  because that is my first check for my new job. That is all I'm saying on any of this.""

After that, I talked with the GS council again and sent them the messages. I told them that if they didn't resolve this I would. They had a meeting about it the next day and decided to remove Candie as a volunteer (obviously) and that they would be going after her for the full amount of what they owe the Girl Scouts and what she stole from our troop. They also agreed to deposit the money right back into our account as soon as she was removed from the bank account. I was super happy about this resolution! There is a catch though... they didn't want me to tell the parents at our last meeting that this was going on. They had to officially send Candie a letter of removal before it was official. Also my contact at the GS council said they still wanted me to pass out flyers for Candie's water park event that she promised. I was pissed about that, because this lady might have a drug problem or something, how in hell can you trust that she will go buy anything for the water park or even show up? AND if she does what if she uses it as an opportunity to scam them out of more money? They had Candie drop off the troop meeting information on my porch so I didn't have to talk to her.

Well, I went to the meeting and no one ended turning up because Candie had conveniently scheduled it the day before they had the day off of school, which I wasn't aware of since I don't have a child in the school. So no one thought there was a meeting. I was actually really happy about that, because I didn't want to encourage them to go to this supposed water park event hosted by criminal Candie. 

After that, the Girl Scout Council agreed to send a representative to have a meeting with the parents and go over our options for next year and having a new troop leader. Candie sent me a message this morning (I guess one of the parents clued her in about our meeting):

""The only thing that needs to be discussed at tonight's meeting, is the fact that I will not be returning as troop leader for Troop 
xxxxxx, my family is moving and will no longer be in the school district or nearby to be able to continue with the truth. I wish you the best of luck.""


Yes, screw her for trying to cover her own ass. Even though I would love to tell everyone how terrible she is, I decided not to tell the parents about Candie. I thought about it a lot, and if I did, one of the parents will tell their daughter and then everyone will be gossiping about Candie's daughter. It is not this poor girl's fault that her step mom is a crook and I don't want her to get bullied because of it. I also think it would turn a lot of the parents away from the troop and I don't want to ruin everyone's girl scout experience because of me. Candie is gone and can't be a part of the troop anymore, so good riddance. Girl Scouts are going after her for all of the money so she will have to face the legal consequences as well. Me telling the parents wouldn't help anything.

Also, on a positive note, at the meeting one of the parents said they will step up and be troop leader, yay! I have decided to stay on and help them as much as possible. I want to have a good experience volunteering and I shouldn't give up because of one jerk. 


**edit** Just wanted to add to those that are worried that Candie can do this to another troop, she has been black listed from the Girl Scouts organization nationally, she is not allowed to be in any leadership role. As far as her doing something shady somewhere else otherwise... there's not a whole lot I can do about that. I can't let everyone in my state know she is a scumbag, so it is what it is.

However, she is probably the most passive-aggression person I've ever known and has a history of throwing me under the bus if it means helping someone else. She isn't a bad person, she's just not considerate of me sometimes. For example, my laptop which I use for work (graphic design) broke and I couldn't afford another one, and she knew that, and she knew I was struggling to save up for another; my uncle died and she took his new $1800 Macbook and gave it away to someone who just needed something basic for Facebook and job applications.

I had a mastectomy about two weeks ago (didn't actually have cancer, so chemo etc. isn't a factor in this). I'm still recovering and need to be taking it easy. Right now I'm trying to keep swelling at bay as I don't want yet another surgery and potential disfigurement, so I need to stay sedentary. I do go out for a couple of hours here and there, but I'm careful.

My grandma (66), who is my dad's mom and lives an hour away, had hand surgery today (repairing a trigger finger). My mother called me after and told me that my grandma needs help and needs someone to take care of her and basically do everything for her. My grandma is very independent, no signs of dementia or anything, and is an active person, so this was surprising to me and kind of came out of the blue. If I'd known recovery would be a big deal, I would've put surgery off until after she had recovered, but she decided to have it with almost no advance warning, and when I researched it to see if I did need to reschedule my surgery, it seemed like hers was pretty minor.

The problem is, Mom told me that she told my grandma I could take care of her (Mom and Dad work full-time, and I'm not working right now so I guess that was her logic, but I'm not working BECAUSE I JUST HAD SURGERY). I asked her why she would put me in that position and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I said she knows I'm recovering from my own surgery and she said I ""seemed fine""... I said I was, as long as I stayed home and kept ice on my chest and took it easy, and that she should've checked with me first. I pulled a childish move when she started berating me and hung up on her.

She texted me almost immediately and said, word for word: ""I guess Gram knows you better than I do! Maybe she thought you would ""feel pressured"" so didn't include you [in the group text] when asking for help. I didn't expect that at all!""

Needless to say I'm crushed. I would LOVE to take care of her, but I can't. Now I feel like everyone thinks I'm a selfish monster and am depressed to the point of feeling sick. I wrote back and told her not to talk to me right now, and I know she's going to call me when she gets out of work but I don't know what to say. :(

UPDATE!!!!!

I just got off the phone with Gram!

She burst into laughter when I told her all the things Mom had said. Apparently Mom had been planning to ""surprise"" her with a $200 bidet because she was convinced Gram would have trouble cleaning herself. Gram said she found out about it accidentally and has been making fun of my mother since.

She said she doesn't need anything outside of opening fresh water bottles (she refuses to drink anything but Poland Springs) and said her neighbor already pre-loosened a bunch of them. Mom had talked to Gram's doctor and went worst-case-scenario, basically. Which is... typical, so I don't know why I didn't see that coming. Gram specifically said ""YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER. You know what she's like. Don't let her work you up. Jesus Christ, if I was going to have that much trouble I would've stayed in the goddamn hospital.""

She also said she didn't include me in the group text because I'm not a worrier and wouldn't be losing my shit wondering if she made it through surgery. She said she just updated Mom and my aunt (her daughter) and said she was fine, and that Mom was the one that went off about how she needed help. She also said ""for crying out loud, you just had surgery, you need to take care of yourself"" so she wasn't expecting me to help at all.

Gram said she'd love if we could talk more over the next few days since she'll be a little bored and asked if we could play Scrabble Online. All's good.

Now Gram and I have an inside joke about ""surprise bidets"" and I'm waiting for my mother to call in about an hour. I've gotten some awesome advice and really appreciate it; I have an idea of what to say now. (I don't want to ignore the call as that'll cause more problems.

Hi everyone, so this more of a thank you more than anything. This is a really happy update. 

Our mother returned to Michigan yesterday and we informed her of the whole situation. We told her that Micheal (older/Vegas brother) had embarrassed Nick (little brother) on Facebook. We told her what was said and all about the situation. She gave Mike the biggest lecture of all time. She basically told him he can run around and get STI until he has them all, she can't control him. But he will not influence Nick to follow his poor example and endanger himself. She told him they teach safe sex for a reason and don't make condoms for shits and giggles. 

My sister and I went out and bought our brother some condoms. It was not as awkward as we thought it was going to be, but we had a conversation with us about them. We told him that we are proud of him and we told him girls would like him alot more for his actions. 

Super happy about this Dayna, the girl who he almost had sex with/his crush. Dayna asked him out on a date and they are going on a date tonight. So he is super happy about that and he is feeling good about his decision to stop. Nick is taking Dayna out on  date to the movies tonight so that's good. 

tl;dr: Mom gave older brother a lecture of a lifetime, got the younger bro some condoms. Brother is taking out the girl he almost had sex/ his crush on a date to the movies

I have good news!

As I mentioned in my original post, I normally work Friday mornings and he comes in for breakfast at the same time every Friday. Well, I had the day off and decided to show up for breakfast at the same time as him. It worked out perfectly!

I sat down in the area where he always sits and waited. About 10 minutes later, he walked in the door and saw me sitting down ordering breakfast. He came up to me and looked a little puzzled because I wasn't wearing my uniform. He asked if I had the day off and I said yes. He said, ""That sucks, you're my favorite waitress!""

I also did my hair and put on some cute clothes that morning and he noticed because he complimented me and said I looked, ""really pretty."" I could feel my face getting hot. I probably turned 10 shades of red. lol. 

Next thing I know, he asked if he could sit at my table with me! I was so nervous. Guys never give me butterflies but he gives them to me all the time. But I acted totally normal and tried not to be a dork. haha! 

Normally, I'm very shy around him but he made me feel comfortable and was super easy to talk to. We sat and talked for awhile before our breakfast came. It was so much fun. My manager was the one waiting on us, which she NEVER does but she's been encouraging me to make a move on him for quite awhile. She was so happy for me!

Anyway, I felt like he was giving me signals the entire time, which made me a lot more confident. So I finally worked up the courage and asked if he'd like to hang out some time and he agreed! We swapped numbers and he's been texting/flirting with me a few times a day ever since! 

Since we've been texting, I've learned that we both enjoy hiking, so I suggested that we go hiking and check out an old lighthouse, which isn't too far from where we live. He just moved here, so he's never seen it before. (We live on the great lakes, Northern Michigan.) So that's what we're planning on doing this weekend!

When we were texting last night, he mentioned that he'd like to go to this fall festival, which is coming up in a couple of weeks and wanted to know if I'd go with him. So I playfully said, ""Are you asking me out on a date? hehe"" and he said, ""Yes.. Will you please go with me? :)""  I'm so excited!!!

Thank you all for your help on my original post! You guys gave me a ton of great advice. I can't believe how easy this whole thing was. Now I see what men have to go through when it comes to asking women out! Anyway, thank you Reddit!

Hello. After several months of absolutely no progress, I really wasn't expecting to have an update for you all after just a few days but here it is!

I talked to her when I got home and managed to find a few minutes alone without distractions and asked her for a status update on the lice removal. Long story short, I was met with another excuse as to why it would have to wait until next week and my foot came down. I don't think she took it seriously until later on in the night when we went to bed. I slept on our futon instead of with her and also turned her down for sex, which is something that I am pretty sure has happened only like twice in our entire relationship.

The very next day she called and made an appointment to get professionally de-loused. I went with to the appointment and they were able to check me as well. The woman did not find anything in my hair even with a magnifying glass and a UV light that apparently makes the nits glow. My wife was treated and is now lice free.

We talked afterwards about why it took so long for her to get it taken care of. Many of you were right; she was embarrassed, broke, discouraged from the hours we wasted trying to treat it ourselves in the beginning, and it was just easier for her to not think about it. Also, once we moved into my parent's house, she was even more embarrased and did not want them to know about it. Pretty much all of the at-home treatments would be a dead giveaway. She apologized, vacuumed, did all of our laundry and bedding, and we have put this annoyance behind us. We also checked our son when he got home from school and he's in the clear too.

So that's that! Still have to get to the bottom of why someone would think it's preferable to have lice than to deal with the embarrasment of people knowing you have lice, but I think that's one of those pesky communication things that we have to work on. 

Thanks very much to those of you that responded with legitimate advice. I got over 100 PM's after my post was locked regarding lice treatments that you found successful lol. Since the last post got a ton more attention than I was expecting and the comments were like 60% misinformation about lice, I'll clear a few things up with info that I learned from the professionals at the delousing clinic (I hope this isn't against the rules):

Lice can't live anywhere except on a human head and they die about 24 hours if they are away. 

Since they die so quickly, it's not possible to have a ""lice infestation"" in your home or on your furniture. All we were told to do to make sure she doesn't get re-infected from a stray lice was to either stay away from unwashed pillows/hats/bedding for a couple days or to wash it in hot water.

Some people are immune to lice and differen't ""families"" (the word the delouser used) of lice only like certain types of hair. In other words, it's entirely possible to live with someone with lice and not get lice.

Hey again.

As much as I wanted to tell you all that it was over nothing, that they just wanted to get some air or smoke some weed or something, not the case. They were indeed fucking.

I asked my boyfriend about it. Didn't mention that I saw him go out with her, just that I saw him leave the bed and come back later. He told me that he just went to pee and then saw his dad in the kitchen who couldn't sleep and they had a chat for a while. Liar.

I asked his sister in law immediately after that, said that I saw her from the window for a second. Was I just imagining it since I was half sleep or did she go out ""alone"" that time of night? She said that she enjoys midnight breaths and alone walks on the beach. Liar again.

I told his brother that I saw them leave. He told me that they enjoy long walks on the beach. He couldn't be bothered to go with them. I thought liar.

So apparently they gave each other the heads up since my boyfriend came to me and told me everything an hour later. Him and his brother like sharing their girlfriends and SOs. He's been fucking his sister in law for years now. That night was just another moment. He told me that he wanted to tell me when the time is right or when he thought I'm prepared so that I can join in and sleep with his brother so they don't even need to sneak around.

He wasn't even admitting that it was cheating, saying that it doesn't count since it's his sister in law not some random girl. I don't even know what to say to that. He called me traditional for thinking it was cheating. Yeah. I consider having sex with anyone else cheating, call me traditional.

So I broke up with him and left him to deal with his weird shit with his brother and I'm actually happier now. The thought of what he was up to all those times grosses me out completely. He can fuck himself. We wanted to go on a holiday together, now I'm gonna go have fun with my cousins instead.

I?m still with Emily. I went forward with the idea that Emily and her son are a package deal in mind, and it?s been kind of a weird process since. We get along really well, and I?ve found that I?m lucky to have this kid in my life. He?s funny, mature, intelligent, witty. But at the same time, he?s *not* my kid and he never will be and that?s something hard to navigate. It?s hard even to describe the feeling- of loving this kid and feeling like a dad, but never being one and feeling like you can?t be one. But I try. It?s a lot of blood, sweat and tears (Emily can testify to the tears), but it?s so worth it. A few weeks after I found out about him, Emily told me her son was getting picked on because he didn?t have a dad to do a father son activity at school with. I decided to go, sort of just to scope out how that sort of thing felt. The look on his face got rid of every question I?ve had, every doubt or regret.

Emily and I are in counseling. We found out shortly after I posted that Emily is pregnant- and we?re twice blessed in that it?s twin girls. There were a lot of emotions, and we both knew that it was a weird situation and we haven?t been dating that long. So, we went to see a counselor. Sometimes Emily?s son joins us, but it?s mostly us, learning how to be our best for her son and our daughters, and each other. We?ve been definitely testing each other some days, and this pregnancy has put a strain on every relationship we have. Her son moved in, and they?re stepping on each other?s toes. I moved in, and we?re all learning our new boundaries and new bonds.

It?s hard. There?s a lot of stupid mistakes I regret making now, that I?ll regret more in 5 years. If I had s time machine and my current knowledge, I might?ve been more careful during sex. I might?ve put distance where I didn?t. But for right now, I?m happy to be with my girlfriend and her son, waiting for our little Amelia and Lorelei. This is teaching me how to be a good dad, a good partner, and a good human. I?m learning coping skills for so many things in life, and I?m just learning how to be okay.

Sam (alias) and I are happy. My family is happy. But my family has no desire to meet or interact with Sam, and Sam is no stranger to familial neglect. As she only maintains a relationship with her sister who lives out of state, she is content with our urban, queer nuclear family (two moms, a pupper and cat.)

I could get into Sam's family history (and type furiously) but suffice it to say, she is a success story in SPITE of her mother and extended family. Naturally, she's not keen on ""family"" and had a lot of hesitation surrounding marriage in the first place. We've been seeing a couple's therapist to set up our relationship with a strong foundation and work out any issues before the big C. (*Commiiiitment*)


I had the opposite experience growing up. Had it not been for my family's attention and care, I would not be half the woman I am today. The reason I am able to communicate with you all is because of the sacrifices my parents made to ensure we moved to a country with better economic opportunities. We're immigrants from a small latin country-- family is everything.  

Of course there's tension because I'm queerful, but it's been 6 years since the other big C (*cooming oouut*) and my parents have grown more tolerant. My partner never comes up in conversation nor do they inquire about my personal life. They know of her, know we bought a house and raised a dog (they love the dog) but they're always side stepping calling her my SO. Occasionally, my mother humors me when I talk about her, but she's not  enthused. It may not be the right time, but I at least have been pushing for Sam to join the family for Christmas. No promises were made, just hand wavy maybes.

Sam would like to be included, in the sort of way someone entertains fanciful fantasies. She wants to impress my family, hang out with my sisters (they have come to the house once before. They're supportive.) However, she is fine waiting until they're more receptive.

Am I pushing too much? Am I not pushing enough? Is there a timeline with these things, or an order of operations? I don't want to put wedding plans on hold because my family hasn't exactly gotten to know the bride yet. Sam isn't crazy about weddings anyway.

The big kicker is telling my parents about getting hitched. The even bigger kicker is having to tell my Dad we're doing a post-nup (like a pre-nup, but after the wedding.) Can't avoid that one since I'm going to need his access to a lawyer.

How do I work up the courage to ask for respect and inclusion? 

Thanks so much in advance.

He was very into me, and did much of the chasing in the early days of our relationship. About 3 months after we started dating, he said ?I love you?. I said it back. I was genuinely in love with him. This is the first time in my life I felt this kind of love.

He has an ex-girlfriend [25F] who he dated for 4 years before they broke up 3 years ago because of their busy schedules. He dated another girl for 1.5 years afterwards, and then me. He and his first ex are still friends, according to him they are just close friends now.

They are busy and dont live in the same city so he almost never sees her. Once, the 3 of us plus her new BF went for dinner together. She was nice to me, very beautiful woman, charming, smart. The kind to turn every head in the room.

I always had this terrible suspicion that maybe my BF still had feelings for her, but he always reassured me when I voiced my concerns to him. We can talk to each other about anything and I appreciate that.

Last week, he said his ex and his boyfriend were in town again and they invited us to brunch. I thought nothing of it and went. At the brunch, his ex mentioned that she and her BF were engaged. This really threw off my BF. His mood just suddenly changed. After the brunch, I noticed him taking her aside and whispering something.

The whole week, my BF seemed to be in a bad mood.  Yesterday morning, I found my BF drinking  shots at the kitchen counter. He looked as if he hadn?t slept all night. I asked him what was wrong. He shrugged. I asked him if itnwas about his ex, because he had been off ever since he saw her.

He said yes. He told me that he hasn?t been able to stop thinking about her and the smile on her face when she showed off her new ring. ?Its funny because I always thought that she?d be wearing my ring.? I was stunned. He continued. ?Dont you have a man who you thought was ?the one who got away??

He asked if he could be honest with me. He told me that he still loved her. That he had always loved her. But he said at the end something about fate and how he had to move on and that he had to focus on us right now. That his ex was a thing of the past. Still, I was fucking devastated. I appreciated his honesty and understand he was drunk, but wow, it fucking hurt.

Im crying in my room and i dont know what to do. I feel like my heart has just been stomped on. My fears have been validated. My bf is only with me because he can?t have his ex. Where do I even go from here.

My boyfriend Steve and I have been dating for over a year in a half. I met him in one of my upper level classes two years ago. At the time he was finishing up his degree, before moving on and working on his masters. Since we started talking, seeing each other, and dating casually; I really loved our entire relationship. Steve and I had a lot of similar interests, which included traveling. We did a small trip to South America a couple months ago for a few weeks (Peru and Chile). We had an amazing time! It was once we got back form our trip that I saw our relationship in a  whole different way. We travelled well together, and bonded in a new way. I knew I was in a great relationship! 

I thought we had a great relationship, until I got some news a few days ago.

Three days ago, I went over to drop a macbook charger over at my best friends house, Chenelle. Chenelle and I have been best friend since we were in high school from the age of 16 years old. I have always considered her to be my number one, and closest person in my life. I have noticed that the past 6 months we haven't hangout in the same capacity that we usually have. Both of us have been busy with our lives (school, work, relationships, etc). But, I kinda got the feeling after this past year of university around April, that she was starting to drift. She had a shitty relationship with her ex that lasted under a year. He cheated on her with a coworker, and the rest is history. They broke ""officially"" around the end of January.

As I went over to drop off her extra charger that she borrowed, I talked with her mom for a bit. Chenelle ended up getting called in to pick up an extra serving shift at the restaurant she has worked at during her degree. Her mom wanted to talk to me about a few things. I was puzzled.. Chenelle's mom was always really outgoing and funny. We had known each other for over 8 years at least. But, she wanted to have a serous talk.

Chenelle's mom, ""Karen"", went on to tell me that she saw Steve and Chenille sneak around the back of the house about a month or so ago. Karen went on to explain that she noticed this happening two other times. At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. She told me that I should talk to Steve and Chenelle ASAP. 

Steve and I were supposed to go out for dinner last night. He picked me up, and off we went. I felt really gross and humiliated the entire time we were out. We ate dinner, had a couple drinks, but we didn't talk much. Steve kept asking me all night what was the matter. I told him ""nothing"".

Finally, when we got back to my place, we sat in my room and I asked him. I asked him, and told him what Chenelle's mom (Karen) told me. He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white. That gave me the answer I needed. I broke down and Steve tried to comfort me. I didn't want him touching me. I didn't even want to hear it! I told him to leave, but I basically had to force him to leave. I tried calling Chenelle and texted her that I needed to talk to her. I got no response. Not one. Basically, two of the closest people I have had in my life betrayed me. This is so terrible and I feel so shitty. I have like no one right now.

445,ApprehensiveOstrich6,Non-Romantic,ar9z64,2333,"My mom has been married for 7 years to a man who leeches off her. He's had multiple different dead end jobs over the years and has spent large amount of times unemployed in between. He contributes nearly nothing and my sister and I both find him deeply unbearable.

A few months back my sister (21) told him he wasn't contributing at all and he got angry and said he had always contributed with credit cards (which mom pays off anyway later) and refills water bottles (that was his big winning argument, I guess). Mom doesn't put him in his place, ever.

He also pawned our late sister's golden earrings for bet money and my sister and I found out months later. Mom also didn't do anything about that and I don't even want to think about it ever again.

He's done many innapropriate things over the years, spoken to us as if he owns the place (it's mom's home) and many other things. It's too long a story to tell. 

Yesterday he and I started an argument over something honestly petty I don't even want to talk about, but that was like the last drop for me and I got in his face and told him everything I hated about him leeching off mom and he got intimidated and left the house. He came back with mom last night and I told mom to choose between him and me. She started crying and I told her she had no dignity left and I was disgusted she would go low enough to marry a man like him. I asked her again and she just cried so I decided to leave. Started packing my things and left others to come back later.

My sister cried and begged me to not go but I left anyway and said many things to her too that she didn't deserve. I went to dad's home. In the past months I've gotten more and more frustrated with mom's husband and had been staying with dad and he told whenver I wanted to leave he would take me in indefinitely. So I went there and he welcomed me.

It's been nearly 24 hours since I left and I still feel enraged and frustrated, but it's been wearing off slowly and I realized that I really pushed mom too far and said terible things to her and my sister. I apologized to my sister and she accepted it and we talked for a while. I'm not ready to apologize to mom yet, though, as she has enabled his BS all these years.

I talked to dad and he gave me some tough love about the way I behaved and I think that's fair, but he also said he would be extremely frustrated, too. So now I just... don't know. I don't know how to move forward from this, I don't know what the future holds for my relationship with mom. She has despite everything been a caring mom, but I can't reconcile with the fact that she has let this man leech off her for so long and hasn't done anything about it.

I kinda feel like I lost respect for her and will never see her the same way again.

Am I justified in what I feel? Did I act the wrong way? Is this the best for me? How should I handle all this from now on? I am scared and feel like my family is crumbling even more because of what I did. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

Edit: I work as a professional and contribute and so does my sister. Step father is unemployed at the moment.

**tl;dr:** Finally snapped at my parasite step father for leeching off us for seven years.

**Tl;dr he called off the (big) wedding because we were both stressed and originally wanted to elope. Can we work through it?**

No, we couldn't because he cheated. I found out this morning through anonymous Facebook message that he wasn't loyal and there was more to the breakup than I knew. I called him twice with no response. So I sent him a text about the message. Still no response. So I decide to check his phone records. Lo and behold, a mysterious number popped up like the day things started to go downhill for us. He'd call the number on nights I was working and text it throughout the day. 

Soon after I saw that I checked Find My iPhone (he got his first iPhone and I helped him set it up like 2 weeks ago). His GPS showed at a random house near downtown that I know none of his friends lived at. Soon after that he called me. He denied it all and was trying to be all supportive. The moment I said I had proof he was hiding things from his phone records, his entire demeanor changed. He specifically stated ""I didn't sleep with anyone."" Which was odd since I never brought up cheating. 

As he was talking I checked find my iPhone again and from the distance, it looked like he left wherever he was and called as soon as he was in the car. I asked where he was and he said driving. I asked from where and he got very defensive saying it wasn't my business since we weren't together. I reiterated I knew he was hiding things from me (I still never brought up accusations of cheating yet). He called me creepy and stalkerish. I asked who the specific phone number belonged to and he refused to answer saying I was crazy. So I said I deserve to know and he said a friend from work (for the next few minutes he refused to assign it gender pronouns). A little bit later I pushed it it was a woman and he admitted it. So I asked who it was and said if it were the few women I know, then I get maybe he was venting to them. He refused to answer. 

So yeah. We can't work it out. 

Also prior to this he was already acting like a hot and cold jerk for the week after he  left me on the day of my bridal shower. Either acting like he didn't care one bit about me or that he wanted me back because his life was falling apart. Needless to say, I became more relieved that the relationship was over and was more mourning the fact I was in the position I was in (cancelling a wedding after a failed engagement). I realized he was very selfish and I took on every responsibility in wedding planning and our relationship while he had nothing to do but work and come home to play video games. For the record, I like video games but only when I have the time. Basically this was the icing on the shit cake and any bit I had left hanging onto the relationship went right out the window. 

I honestly feel relieved. I don't feel sad. I feel... free. And happy. I'm not sad being in the apartment we shared anymore. My sister had helped me two nights ago set up a new bed that help change the entire look of the bedroom. 

Also Monday I'm going to a theme park with a coworker. While I'm not exactly trying to jump right into anything, he's a great guy and we have the same interests. It's just nice to have attention from someone I get along with.

447,throwbabyjim,Relationships,3gqp3y,2326,"Background: My sister and I were born into a terribly abusive, poverty-stricken family. Because our parents were either always drunk or high or never around, my sister basically had to raise me by herself. The minute she turned 18, she took me with her and we ran. We were homeless for a short while but my sister always took care of me. She worked wherever she could, always made sure I was fed and clothed, even made sure I went to school! I owe her more than you can imagine. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to go to college and a high school diploma doesn't open many doors. When she turned 20, she started working as an escort. A client of hers was really taken with her and proposed they start a sugar daddy/baby relationship. She continued on with this relationship until she was 24, pretty long for a relationship like that but my sister and this guy really liked each other and continue to be friends. My sister has always been upfront with me, and while it did take me a while to work over my feelings about my sister being a sex worker I realised that it didn't change her as a person at all. I felt guilty that she had to do all of this for me, but she always insisted that being a sugar baby was great for both of us. Her sugar daddy was this nice middle-aged Japanese man that taught her the language, got her to take the JLPT and later certified to teach Japanese (which is her current job at a local college). It seemed like for the first time in a long time my sister was able to breathe. We got an apartment, I got to continue my schooling, everything was great. 

Current issue: My sister and I still live together. My girlfriend, who I've been with for a little over a year now, was over at our apartment two months ago. We came from a party so we were both pretty drunk. When we got there, I noticed my sister wasn't home. My girlfriend asks if she can go into my sister's bathroom and use her makeup remover, and because I was wasted and not thinking (and because I trusted her) I let her go. She comes out after a few minutes with a photo she said she found in the drawer of my sister's vanity as she was looking for the makeup remover. It was an old photo of my sister and her sugar daddy hugging and looking pretty intimate. And this is where I fucked up, Reddit. At the time, I guess it wasn't just the alcohol that influenced me but the fact that I thought I knew and trusted this girl. I got giddy seeing the picture, told her this dude was the guy that helped my sister turn our lives around. I told her the whole fucking story. When I woke up in the morning, my girlfriend didn't say anything about it and I thought that was that. Fast forward to last Monday - I found out that while I had been running around getting a surprise ready for her birthday, she was fucking a friend of mine. I told her it was over, and she came over with all the excuses and begged me to take her back. Today, she messaged me with a picture she took of the photo my sister had on her vanity, and a screenshot of the guy's LinkedIn. She told me I either take her back or she'll tell my sister's bosses about how she used to be ""a filthy whore"".

I'm scared Reddit and I don't know what to do. I know that sugaring isn't illegal, and that that photo can't really prove anything, but rumours like that could potentially kill my sister's career in the academia. I haven't told my sister yet and I haven't messaged her back yet. What do I do? I can't believe I've fucked this up for my sister. I'm in college because of her; I'm going to MED SCHOOL because of her. If she weren't here, if she didn't decide to do whatever she could for me, I'd probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.

The thing is they use to do fraud all the time like it was no big deal and they want me to i guess follow blindly. They never learned their lesson from committing fraud because they havent been caught. They would take money out of my dad's account(somewhere around 15 thousand in total) and open credit card and phones under his name. My dad was from another country and sadly didnt know how any of those things worked or how to check on them. My mother is evil. I wont go into the things that she did to him or I or the rest of her children but shes bad enough to the point where I wont trust her alone with my daughter.

my father passed away last year. . I knew what they were doing was wrong and begged them not to do it and even got yelled at and scolded for trying to make them stop on several occasions. I never went to my dad though to let him know what was going on. I was scared he would leave us and now I know that was selfish and I should have just told him. Although I wasnt the one to take his money I have a lot of guilt for not speaking up I was around 17 at the time. I regret my silence to the fullest.

Anyways here we are in the present and I'm made out to be the bad guy because I wont cooperate.

I cant do that that to myself. I feel like this is it. This is what's going to end our (mom and sister)relationship. I should also throw in that they both are pill poppers. It's a touchy subject with them. I get yelled at anytime I mention them and pills In the same sentence even when it's in a concerning heartfelt way. I'm hoping they dont try to forge the paper work or my signature. Part of me thinks they will if they somehow convince themselves that they can get away with it. I love my family I do...but I've realized they dont love me or at least not in a sincere way. Not if they treat me like shit for not wanting to commit fraud. They cant even try to look at it from my perspective.

I tried to decline doing the refinance for the mortgage thing in a nice proper way but that didnt go over too well... Anyone have any suggestions on maybe how to end this on proper terms? Or is this good enough reason to go no contact with family?

Update:  I just found out my work  didnt update my change my address when I put the forms in and now my w2's were sent to my old address (there's) I'm scared they can use these instead of my pay stubs and come my signature.

449,abandonedfiancee,Relationships,53xprh,2321,"This happened about eight months ago, and I?ve tried to be reasonable and put it past me but I?m really struggling. I?ve been told what he did was reasonable, makes sense, etc, but I keep coming back to that moment of total abandonment and fear when I realised he?d run. I just feel completely alone around him now.

We were walking home from a work function at a bar at around 1am. Neither of us had drunk that evening so we weren?t even slightly tipsy. Two guys across the street from us crossed over and approached us asking if we knew where such-and-such a street was. As fianc? turned around to point out where the street was, one of the guys pulled out a knife and told us to stop moving and to give him all our shit (phone, wallet, etc). I was surprised by how calm I was in the moment, and told them I needed to reach into my coat pocket to get my phone. As I was doing that, the guy pressed the knife against my ribs as warning because I guess he was worried I had a gun (even though that?s pretty unlikely in my country). When this happened, my fianc? bolted. It took me a bit to even realise he?d left me, and when I realised that he?d run I was certain I was about to get badly hurt or die.

Fortunately, the thieves seemed to get kind of spooked by him getting away and just hurried me up. They took my phone, bag (with my purse with all my money, cards, personal effects), necklace (worth like ten bucks) and legged it. The whole ordeal from start to finish took maybe five minutes.

I was kind of in shock and wandered off back up the street, heading back towards the bar, not even really thinking. A few minutes later my fianc? found me and told me he called the police, who arrived about ten minutes later.

I found out that fianc? had run about a block away, calling emergency services as he ran. We were both okay physically, except for a tiny bit of broken skin on my ribs where they?d pressed the knife.

My fianc? says what he does makes sense ? that if he?d hung around and it turns out they?d wanted to hurt us or worse, we?d both be fucked because no one else would be around to call the cops or an ambulance. That he wanted to be alive and able to help in case something happened to me. He also says that by running away, the thieves didn?t want to hang around any longer than necessary (which is true), which might have saved me. His mum agrees and has praised him for not being an idiot, but my own mother has quietly told me she thinks he?s a coward for abandoning his wife-to-be (but she also has very oldschool beliefs about gender roles). Fianc? asked me not to tell our friends exactly what happened, because he says they wouldn?t understand his actions unless they were there.

My own thoughts are that, by running away, he potentially significantly decreased my chance of survival. I?m only about 157cm (5?2?) and 51kgs (110lbs). He?s 178cm (5?10?) and 75kg (165lbs). The two guys were about his size. They would have been able to easily overpower/subdue me, but my fianc? there would have made it 2v2 (although we would have still been at a disadvantage, them still having a knife and size advantage) and not left me completely at the mercy of two criminals who mug couples at night. I also wonder, what would have happened if him leaving me had given them the courage to do something worse? I mean, I don't think they would have - they seemed pretty strung out, interested in valuables and cash only - but what if?

I look at him and wonder, do I even want kids with him? If I did have a child with him, would he abandon him or her in a dangerous situation because it was the ?smart? thing to do?

I?ve lost a lot of attraction to him. He accuses me of wanting to use him as a meatshield just because he?s a man, and that what he did was smart and not the machismo stupidity I ?wanted? that could have gotten us both killed. I didn?t want him to try to fight them? I just wanted him by my side. Which I guess is selfish, because it was a dangerous situation. I don?t feel safe around him anymore, which I used to. I?m even scared of the dark again, despite him lying in bed right next to me.

As I'm typing this, I kind of feel like Lex in Jurassic Park, after being ditched by the lawyer - ""He left us! He left us!"". Stupid thing to add, but I keep thinking of that scene!

I don?t know what to think. He doesn?t want to see a counsellor because, again, he says they wouldn?t understand the situation unless they?d experienced it themselves. We fortunately don?t have a wedding date set, so there?s no immediate pressure of marriage. Please help!

If I missed your comment on my last post i'm really sorry and I've just been super busy with law school as well as my relationship. I decided to take a week to let things settle in even further. I made it explicitly clear that his behavior wasn't ok and we needed a change if this relationship was going to survive. Verbally he was on board, but after 24 hours it really fell apart.

Tonight, I pulled the plug. It was hard, and awful because I do love him and I will always love him but we are no longer in love. He asked me what I wanted, and I said I wanted him to be ok with less communication and be confident in our relationship, so that I could be at school guilt free. I asked him what he wanted, and he said he wanted more of my time, communication and energy.

His wants had nothing to do with what was best for me, or would make me happiest.

That was really hard to hear and we both cried for awhile when I pointed that out. He understood, he saw it coming and he didn't beg or fight it. We just cried.

So anyway, I wanted to say thank you to EVERYONE who reached out to me. Seriously, it made me feel like I was actually in control of the situation and not crazy for walking away. Thank you for being a community that validates others feelings and is honest and truthful.

Now, I'm gonna go shower and watch stupid shows on netflix.

For example I had all my wool sweaters in a special hamper that I told her to never wash the clothes in it so I can make sure they don't get ruined but sure enough she washed and dried them all and they all died. Even though sweaters aren't that expensive individually replacing them cost a ton of money. I kinda think she's doing it on purpose because she thinks it's cute, which would be my fault because when she broke my iPad Pro I told her it was cute how worried she got about telling me. She says she's just clumsy but I don't think that's what is happening. We've been together for almost two years and I've never noticed any clumsiness. 


I locked all my shit up in my office when I went to work the past few days since there was another incident and that upset her a lot because she thinks I can't trust her and I'm treating her like a child. Is it really so wrong to lock up my shit though? She wants to borrow my camera this weekend and I straight up told her no because I know she's going to break it. I'm not using it but I do wedding photography when I want to bring in some extra cash so having to buy another camera would really suck.

452,Contractorgirl,Relationships,bcj70v,2316,"My tl;dr is at the bottom. 

My husband (45M) and I (35F) have been together for 10 years. We have two children, an 8 year old and a 9 month old. My husband was a very nice husband before I was pregnant and during my second pregnancy. After our second baby was born he started being very mean to me. He has always been a bit selfish, but it was always something I could handle before.

He tries to ruin things I have planned. As an example, I was going to take my dad to an event and my husband calls me and tells me he is going to be two hours late to watch the kids because he has to go shopping. Then he tries to push me to be mad at him. He will say, does this upset you? Are you getting mad? Then he will act like I?m the crazy person when I do get upset with him. 

He makes fun of my hobbies or puts down and activity I do.  I actually took up running because he likes it and it was something I could do without him making fun of me. We planned to go on a run together and I set up a babysitter for an hour. I was waiting for him to show up and he never did. When I asked him what he was doing he said he was running. So he left me hanging while he still got to enjoy the activity. This also wasted a precious hour of babysitting time. 

He is also unnecessarily cruel. I went on a four day trip with our two kids. He stayed at home because he had to work. When I came home he told me that maybe he could pick me up from the airport but maybe not. I told him it?s fine I will take a cab. But even up until I got on my plane ride he was telling me if he was free he would be at the airport but there was no guarantee. Then after I got home he immediately started lecturing me on spending money on our older son. Which, after a four day trip of taking care of two kids (one being a baby) I was just exhausted and didn?t want to be lectured the second I walked through the door. So I just told him I agree with you and I?m sorry. But he just kept going and going. 

Other examples of him being cruel are him telling a family member that I can?t handle the baby by myself. pouring a pop down the sink that I gave him saying he doesn?t want that pop and then grabbing the exact same brand of pop out of the fridge to drink.  

I could go on but I think these might be enough examples. Like I mentioned earlier, these behaviours have been happening after our second baby was born. As things happen I do usually call him out on the spot, but he usually gaslights me in the moment and we get nowhere. He wants to go to couples therapy or just personal therapy for himself (his idea). But I?m honestly wondering is it worth it? I would prefer not to divorce but I?m honestly wondering if we could save this marriage or should I just walk away? 

Tl;dr: husband has been treating me very badly for several months. He wants to go to couples therapy but I feel like the damage is done. How do I proceed?",1555105153.0,I (35F) not sure if my marriage is going to work out with husband (45M).,0.97

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dlhk6/i_28f_think_my_husband_35m_might_be_hiding/


I asked my husband about everything in my post and he had really good reasons for some of it. It felt like that was the first time in a long time that he was being completely honest with me. He showed me inside the safe, backpack, showed me he had a second phone.


For anyone wondering the backpack just had clothes, an iPad and laptop, toiletries etc for ?work trips.? The safe also held a gun which I had no idea he had. He says he got the second phone because he almost got fired for being unreachable one time so he got another phone on a  different network so his boss can always reach him, and he didn?t tell me because he didn?t want me to worry about him getting fired or us having to move to an area with better reception.


I had decided to just leave it at that for a while because he was finally being honest with me and I knew he wasn?t doing anything nefarious so I was just going to drop it, but I saw he left his phone unlocked when he went to the bathroom and I couldn?t help myself so I snooped? I know thats bad but I just wanted to stop worrying. I looked at his texts and there was one woman who told him she loved him and the texts were really flirty, and another woman who he was talking to but I didn?t have time to read that convo. I only had maybe two minutes on his phone before he came running back from the bathroom (probably realizing he left his phone unlocked). 


He knows I know but he doesn't want to discuss it because he doesn't know how much I know, so he's been pretty much avoiding our son and me since then. Honestly I just wish I never picked up his phone in the first place. I know that I need to leave him but just the thought of being a single mom and our son having to live the ""divorced parents"" life makes me sick. I've only told a couple people and my one friend offered to take me and the baby in so I can finish up my maternity leave without having to worry about buying a house, but he has a newish girlfriend so I doubt that would be ok with her, and he works in the same department as my husband. 


That's all there is to update on. I know I need to get my shit together and deal with this but I'm having a really hard time pulling it together.

Something completely magical happened. My wife and I were looking at a house we both actually love. It has every single thing we waned in our retirement home and it's close to everything that we need. We were thrilled and when she told her aunt and showed her the pictures of the house her aunt laughed and said ""You can't buy that, it has stairs! I can't go up and down the stairs!"" 

Something clicked in my wife's mind. She simply said to her aunt, it's the house that my husband and I like and the fact that it has some stairs that you are healthy enough to go up and down on won't stop us. Her aunt cried and cried. We called our (new) therapist which suggested that we treat her like a child, check on her every 15 minutes but not give in. We did that and she got over it by the next morning. 

My wife also got more ""tough love"" with her aunt and whenever she'll complain about stuff my wife knows are unreal my wife dismisses it politely. 

Things aren't 100% perfect, the new therapist helped my wife a lot, she mainly focused on her and why my wife was feeling the almost nurturing need to be there for her aunt. 

Thank you /r/relationships for the advice, changing therapists was a great idea, I don't know if I have had the courage to just follow through without you but I did the very next day.

First, WOW. Did not expect this post to get so much attention. I originally planned to reply to all the comments, but theres like 500 on that post now, PLUS messages in my inbox. So, going to be that person and say a general thank you to everyone who took the time to reach out and weigh in. I read all your comments and messages and I decided to talk to Alan.


I texted him before he got done work and asked him if he had any plans after, and if not, I'd like to talk to him about something. He said he'd come straight home.

He got home and we sat down to talk. I opened with saying that I loved him very much and that he was so different from anyone I'd ever met and let him know how much he means to me. I then said ""But"" and brought up what happened at his parents' dinner. Like many of you suggested, I made it clear to him why it was hurtful/ignorant. I told him that in all our time together, he had never made me feel ""other"" and therefor it was a pretty bad shock to hear him say what he said. I told him that it's hard for a lot of people to be minorities in this country, because you always have other people expecting you to play the cultural-bound immigrant, even if you just aren't interested. 

For me, personally, I just prefer not to have to have one foot in two different worlds. I grew up here and that's all I really identify with. The fact that because I look the way I do, or have the last name I do, people *expect* me to be more than I am in regards to India. It's very frustrating when it's a damned if you do or damned if you don't situation. Even in the thread, I had people saying that I'm ashamed of being of Indian descent because I don't fucking care about all the cultural ties to it. To that I say, hey, did you think Alan was *ashamed* of being German/Irish because he's not calling himself German/Irish -American or keeping any norms alive from those cultures? So once again, it falls on me to have to play this part that I have *no fucking interest in playing*. So stop shoving this idea that people are married to their ancestors' culture down people's throats because it creates yet another barrier when it comes to integration.

And then I showed him the thread. 

By the time he got done reading everything, comments included, he look mortified. He apologized for the way he treated me during dinner and he admitted to me that his views had been ignorant. We had a long discussion about norms and attitudes he grew up with, and as many of you noted, Alan grew up with ""white"" being the default for American.  He said he never had thought about how caucasians get a free pass when it comes to being American, but someone with different features is immediately considered an ""other"" and needs a hyphen. I apologized to him for not explicitly spelling it out, but I told him that I assumed in this day and age it would be a little more obvious to him. We talked about future children and we both agreed to have them grow up American, and if later they chose to connect with other roots then that was fine too. He said he never wanted to make our kids feel like he made me feel with those comments.

And no, he didn't want the whole Bollywood wedding some people thought he wanted. He was just making sure I knew that i had that choice. But now he has promised not to bring it up again and we've finally laid *that* issue to rest. I also told him, albeit a bit more jokingly, that I wouldn't be making him any rohti so he can stop holding his breath that I'd become some indian housewife. 

We both agreed that this is probably not the last conversation we will have about race. But we also agreed that we wouldn't let it go under the rug again. He said he won't be hyphenating anyone else from now on, and instead let them set that identity for themselves. I appreciated that a lot and I could actually see that he took it seriously, that he wasn't just saying whatever I wanted to hear. 

So, wedding is still on. Yaay

Really, thank you guys so much. It was good to feel validated in this. It made me want to actually approach the issue instead of ducking my head and ignoring it. If I didn't know about this sub, I probably would have kept it bottled and so much resentment would have accumulated before I finally exploded. Like a firework. On 4th of july. :p

Hi everyone! Thanks for reading this update! I have added some extra details at the beginning to better explain what happened. Things took some M. Night Shyamalan twists.

**Details**

Shelly and I were not close friends. We were simply roommates with our own separate bedrooms and a connecting kitchen/living space. I have only known her since last December when we originally signed our leases. We have hung out, but the only real connection we had is that she likes anime/Japan and I am Asian.

The CraigsList ad that Shelly posted didn't have a photo. It turns out that she had used a generic photo of the two of us in an ad on our college's FaceBook page, but Shelly took it down before I got a chance to take a screenshot.

---

**Actual Update**


After I made my Reddit post, Shelly was locked in her room for three hours. I tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't come out of the room. She left her room to get food, and just walked past me as if I didn't exist. Everyone who I called told me that until Pete actually showed up, no crime was being commited so I couldn't report it until then. I just sat by the door and window watching for Pete's car. This continued until early Saturday morning when Shelly woke up for her morning jog. I was still on lookout for Pete's car (I stayed up all night on the couch).

Shelly tried to sneak out past me, but I woke up and blocked the door. I needed an explanation for why I was being forced to stay up all night waiting to call the police on Pete when she knew that I had a restraining order against him. Shelly's explanation was that the restraining order doesn't matter to her, that she has dealt with 'unreasonable people' like me before, and that she has never listened to any restraining order before now, so why should she just for me? The more I listened, the sicker I felt. *Shelly basically admitted to me that she is a cunt.*

I told Shelly that she was a real piece of work and that I was going to maintain my watch for Pete and that I would contemplate taking legal action. She told me that whether I liked it or not, she was done looking for subletters and that it was my problem. I told her to get out and go for her jog and she left and came back a bit later and locked herself in her room again.

Sometime around noon, I had accidentally fallen asleep becaue I had been awake 36+ hours at that point. I woke up and saw Pete helping Shelly move her stuff into her car. I didn't see him in the apartment, but he was helping her in the parking lot. I immediately locked them both out and called the police. Shelly and Pete came to the door again and when Pete saw it was locked and when he saw me watching from the window, he blew up at Shelly. He started to ask her why I was in the apartment and why Shelly didn't tell him that I was the roommate. He demanded his money back and I could hear them screaming at each other through the door.

The cops showed up, handcuffed Pete and Shelly. I told them my story and Pete said he had text messages and emails to back himself up. The cops checked his phone, saw texts from Shelly saying along the lines that her roommate wouldn't care about x,y,z because *he* was a chill *guy*. Pete had posted his own ad looking for a male roommate. That's right, Shelly is a liar too. The cops released Pete because he had proof that he didn't know it was me (I'm okay with this because I saw the emails/texts too). Shelly was charged with disorderly conduct and her mom came to get her.

Sunday evening, Shelly and her Mom come back to the apartment to finish packing for her study abroad. Shelly made some snide remarks about me 'definitely going roommate hunting' to find her a subletter as I said I would. I ignored her. Shelly left for her plane this morning.

You know the good thing about separate leases? I am only liable for my rent, not hers. So I'm going to sit on my butt for the rest of the summer while she gets evicted for lack of rent payment. :)

457,Weloveournanny,Non-Romantic,3omknu,2303,"So I am a single mom of 2 twin boys that well call Luther and Donovan (3). My husband died of cancer 4 months after they were born after being diagnosed for 48 hours. It was obviously a huge shock but luckily I have amazing family and friends that all rallied together and took care of me and my boys. I still see a therapist but the years are passing and can feel the pain fading more and more with each year. 

My husband and i were very smart with our money and waited about 10 years before trying for our boys and when he died I received a considerable sum of money in the form of life insurance and such. I also am a trained RN and went back to work about a year after he died and I felt like I could be away from Luther and Donovan. However, going back to work meant placing them into a daycare program. At first it was great but then it wasn't. To spare the details I had one of my boys come home with a cut lip and black eye and magically no one saw how it happened. Granted boys can be boys but that's a fairly large injury for no one to see happen. 

So I decided to hire a nanny. I went through a nanny service in my city and was paired with a couple but never really felt the ""click"" with anyone till I met Tabitha (24). Tabitha and I were instant connection from the moment we met. What's even more is the cnnection she instantly had with my twins, even Luther who is EXTREMELY shy. They all just instantly fell in love and I was so beyond grateful. I come home to a clean house, happy kids, and dinner. I more then make up in compensation to Tabitha in hopes that she'll stay with us for the years to come. 

But now my problem is this. Tabitha is stunningly beautiful. I mean the first moment I met her my jaw almost touched the ground. She is the kind of natural beauty that is almost sickening because it's just so unfair that a human can look that good without even trying. Her beauty was obviously never an issue for me at all since she also happens to be an amazing person and nanny for my family.

My husband and I moved into our neighborhood about our 5th year of marriage so these are all families I know very well. Some of them actually were a huge support during the time of his death. Most of the families are young husbands and wives and a few them have nannies as well. They schedule play dates on an app called Meetup and go to parks and fun activities with all the kids. I told Tabitha about it right away and she was extremely excited to be out and about with other adults and to let the twins socialize with other kids. So the first event came and went and I of course asked Tabitha how it went. She seemed a little.... Guarded as she told, ""Fine."" And didn't go into many more details. I just shrugged it off and honestly didn't think much about it. 

About a week later I got a notification for another meetup and told Tabitha about it. She got really really nervous and asked if she had to go. I said of course not but what was the problem? She burst into tears and said that the last play date she went to was awful. She said that the moms refused to even look at her or talk to her and when she asked a simple question of them snapped at her and said, ""obviously there's no brains in that pretty body, huh?""  She was stunned and decided to take the boys to the park playground since she obviously wasn't welcomed. I guess that the husband of one of these moms chased her down as she was leaving and told her that it was just petty jealously and that he would talk to these women for her since they obviously did not know her and any friend of our family was welcome in the neighborhood. Then he asked for her phone number to schedule more up coming play dates that would be without the drama. Tabitha said that he was really being nice and did not pick up a creepy vibe at all. 

Then I guess the texts started. I know this father personally as they are next door neighbors and I just can't believe that he would do this but Tabitha even showed me her phone and it was....sickening to say the least. There's texts asking for nudes, texts saying that he watches her from his wondows, texts that say he's falling in love with her, even a text saying he would pay her $1000 just to smell her hair?!?! What the actual fuck???? 
Not only that but hen she started recieving texts from other phone numbers, numbers I don't even have in my phone claiming to be from other fathers in the neighborhood that are ""secret admirers"" and saying lewd and disgusting things to her. 

I literally have no idea what to do. I am not about to give up the nanny that has been nothing short of amazing with my children, that much I know. I know I could probably go to the police for the messages but what can they do? She's not a minor and they never acted upon anything but some of these messages are really unnerving. Should I raise hell in my neighborhood and risk getting blacklisted? Not that I obviously want friends like that any way but I know it will cause a huge up roar. Or should i even consider moving? I just don't know what to do
 

tl;dr: My wonderful nanny has been getting creeped on by my neighbors and I don't know what to do.

I sat in a chair and felt sick and sort of passed out slowly but was still pretty concious. I heard my dad and his friends laughing at how drunk I seemed, instead of like, you know, worrying about me being sick. I heard my dad say ""shes always been a drunk, could never handle her liquor"" (interesting, considering ive never drank in front of my dad). He also said ""since she broke up with her boyfriend she put on a ton of weight, i suppose it always happens to women around her age, cant control what they eat"". Which is also interesting, considering I only gained about 20 pounds in total (I am 5'11, 20 lbs is nothing). He then went on this sort of like, sexist rant about how modern kids turn into awful people in their 20s, using my 'recent behavior' as an example. He said ""her apartment is fucked up because she did something stupid, so she just runs to her mom for help instead of helping herself"" not even mentioning to them that my apartment caught on fire as the result of a fire in the NEXT apartment over. He said I was sensitive, sheltered, lazy etc. He said ""I thought I raised her right, never thought she would be such a fucking failure, I mean look at her right now, jesus christ"". I literally earn more money than him at my job right now, but he has the audacity to call me a failure?

While I was drunk enough that I was basically slumped over with my eyes closed, at a certain point I could have gotten up but I was scared for some reason to let them know I could hear everything. So I just stayed there pretending I was asleep.

I am just so disgusted at my dad right now. I am actually genuinely astounded at the things he said about me, one, because most of it was just straight up lies, and two the fact that he would shit talk me in front of his friends that way?? What the fuck?

I honest to god thought my dad was a great guy but this just changes my entire opinion of him. Why would he do this to me? To brag to his friends? To make it seem like I am such a burden on his life?

459,lilithsdelight,Non-Romantic,a89tji,2298,"I faded out Nina because she was inconsiderate and self-centred. We were friends in school a decade ago and reconnected last year. For a year we were very close and she was great at some points (e.g. had me over to cry right after my breakup, always invited me over for dinner with her kids). 

However, she was also dismissive of me (most of our conversations were about her; if you told her something, her usual response is to ignore it and talk about herself), to the point of being critical or rude (e.g. told me after my breakup that she didn?t see me ever being married, also told me she didn?t think I was capable enough to ever switch jobs). She would also roll her eyes and be sarcastic if I mentioned I had been at the gym (she was very overweight then, though I never mentioned it). I think the final straw was that she kept bringing her kids along to our meetups and conversation consisted of entirely her life, while being dismissive of anything in mine. 

In short I began a slow fade and haven?t seen or spoken to her since January (her kid?s birthday party, for which she requested very expensive gifts). I explained a few times that I wouldn?t be hanging out because I?ve been busy and have a lot of stuff going on in my life, then basically stopped replying.

Since then, she has been contacting a large number of our school friends (who have not spoken to her for over a decade) to ask what I?m busy with and why she hasn?t heard from me. Recently, it has extended to her getting her 6-year-old daughter to call me on the phone, from a variety of unknown numbers. I pick up these calls because my mother is ill and I worry that the hospital may call - however, it?s mostly her kid calling me to ask why I?m not around, followed by a message from Nina that her kid misses me so she told the kid she could call me.

I feel really bad, especially as I think she is genuinely concerned. Even so, I don?t want to share with her what?s going on in my life because I don?t think she would be supportive. I don?t want to share, period.

I don?t want to block her because this would really incite warfare - I?m certain she would launch an attack on me to all our mutual friends and generally get really angry and hurt. How can I communicate I don?t want to resume the friendship on the same terms as before?

TL;DR: Friend keeps asking people why I?m MIA, is now getting her little daughter to call me.

EDIT: Updating at someone?s suggestion to say that another friend has previously asked Nina for time out because the friendship was too demanding.

460,Keshet279,Non-Romantic,5qtdu2,2299,"So I started seeing my therapist a few months ago and after the first session I decided I liked him and felt like I could trust him. We've recently been doing some work on my lack of assertiveness/ inability to call people out if they upset me because I'm scared of hurting their feelings.

I can't exactly remember how the conversation went but he suddenly said ""can I be honest with you? And I hope you trust me enough to listen and not take this personally but from the moment I met you I could tell you were very vulnerable. I knew that if I wanted something more from you than a working relationship, I could have had it. You're in a vulnerable position here, I'm a man who's stronger than you and I could see your vulnerability, I knew you wouldn't say no""

First of all this pissed me off because obviously I would say no, I'm engaged and also am not about to fuck my therapist regardless of my situation. Second of all I found it really creepy and unprofessional. I get the point he was trying to make, I just don't understand why he had to use that theoretical situation. 
Third of all, why the hell was he wondering whether he thinks he could take advantage of me or not in our first session?

Another important point is that I was raped in the past and he is fully aware of this. He brought it up and said ""I can see how it happened, you didn't give him the right signals that you didn't want to have sex with him. By the way I'm in no way suggesting that it was your fault"" I couldn't help but think that he totally was suggesting that and it really upset me. Also, that's not even true- my rapist was fully aware I did not want to sleep with him. I can't stop thinking about it but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. Maybe I just didn't want to hear what he said so I'm thinking he's wrong to say those things when in actual fact he's just doing his job?

He's said other slightly weird things in the past that I've let go and assumed I was being oversensitive but I can't stop thinking about this.

My sister, Laura, has always been a very sweet girl. She was always respectfull and kind, intelligent, pretty. She was great to me while growing up, and she loved kids.


Laura is adopted. We all are. Her biological parents died. Our adoptive parents are not bad people but they are very...weird. For example they do not say 'your T-shirt is ugly', they say 'you are ugly'.


Laura was studying at University. Had good grades. 2 years ago she got a boyfriend: Jens. He was an asshole. He cheated on her, told her how he wanted to beat her, was mad cause she did not cheat on him etc. He went out with other girls etc. After4 months he broke up with her.


Laura had never been the Same. She told us about how Jens would date all his ex's for at least a year. Even the ones he did not love. Laura felt like a loser. To top things of, she had been bullied by the girl he cheated on her with. She was threatening her etc.


6 months ago, Laura told out mother that she did not want to return to the city she studied at. We had seen it coming,for 2 weeks she only slept, did not eat. Our mother told her 'To think long and hard' and How she was going to be a 'loser working at a supermarket'. They got into a huge fight and Laura went to bed. 


The next morning she was gone. She took a train and further we do not know. She posted on Instagram 'Goodbye'. Police came and our mother was not able to answer a single question: her friends, hobby's, what she liked, the subject of her bachelorpaper,... Our mother could not answer a thing.


It's been 6 months. Police found her. But she told them she wishes to be left in peace. As an adult, they have to respect that.


I miss my sister. I am also mad. At her. But especially at my mom, and Jens. For being so mean and hurting her, while in fact she was so sweet. I don't get why she ran away. How she could do that.


I feel a lot of anger towards people. I would like to know how I could handle this? And if any of you know or could explain why people run away? Thank you

My original post didn?t get a huge amount of attention but some people were asking for an update when I had one so here goes. 

Long story short, I guess I wasn?t hiding my addiction very well (shocker I know) and my brother straight up just asked me what I was on. We had an hour long frank conversation where he told me he thought I was an idiot for thinking I could keep this from him (and he agreed not to tell our parents) and I agreed to go to detox at the hospital (we live in Canada so, free). 

I don?t want to talk about what the detox was like as I?m sure people can imagine and others who have gone through it can explain it better than me, but yeah, it wasn?t fun. 

Anyways, this was two months ago. I have been clean since then and I am on a waiting list to see a therapist. 

I didn?t tell him about the money for sex, and he didn?t ask me how I was getting all the money. I have been having problems with the more sketchy people I had coming around bothering me after I cut contact with them, but honestly there isn?t really much I can do about it. 

People will probably call me an idiot for this and I know I am being an idiot, but I still haven?t gotten tested for anything yet, not HIV or anything. It?s not that I can?t, it?s that I?m scared to death. The men who I slept with for money, some of them were super sketchy and were sick with who knows what. But I didn?t care back then. 

Either way, I haven?t gone to get tested, even though I know I?m being stupid. 

Just thought I?d throw this update out there. 

Tl;dr: Talked to my brother, did detox, still haven?t gotten STI checked.

My husband is a science teacher and NOT a jock. Though he happens to have a black belt in judo, which he doesn't go around telling people.


Sister and her boyfriend were watching football at our apartment last weekend. Talk turned to mixed martial arts, and my sister's boyfriend starts pontificating and humble bragging about how tough it is, and by extension how tough HE is. He goes on and on about how he is ""not a huge guy but can take down anyone,"" and that he has moves that are impossible to counter.


He's about the same height as my own husband (my husband is Japanese; sister's boyfriend is Irish-American) but much more muscular. My husband is fit but very slender. Anyway my husband innocently says that no move is really impossible to counter.


So, since his jock sensibilities were threatened, sister's boyfriend offers to demonstrate an unbreakable hold on my husband. My husband doesn't talk about judo with anyone and not even my sister knows he's a high-ranking expert, so her boyfriend tries to demonstrate the hold, and my husband easily breaks it.


So, he says he was going easy on my husband, and offers to try harder. My husband consents, and this time not only breaks the hold again, but counters the move and holds sister's boyfriend in a compromising, embarrassing position, and tells him to break the hold.


Sister's boyfriend is totally humiliated and eventually ""surrenders."" He is humble about it and shakes my husband's hand. Rest of the afternoon seemed to go just fine.


But later on Facebook my sister mentions to me that my husband was being a bully to her boyfriend. In fact my mom called me later and told me to tell my husband to stop showing off, and for him to stop messing with sister's boyfriend.


One would think my husband was stealing candy from children or something.


I texted my sister back and said that her boyfriend was the one bragging endlessly about what a badass he thinks he is, and out of nowhere challenges my husband to break an ""impossible"" hold, and so my husband humors him and does exactly that.


I personally think my sister is just butthurt because she knows my meek little husband would absolutely smack the shit out of her alpha dog if they had a fight, and she's processing it all like an immature ten year old instead of moving on with her job of... Unemployed.


Then she went into a long spiel about how teachers are all corrupt (I'm a teacher too, for history) and just collecting paychecks and doing a lousy job, and how I think that now that I married a foreign person I think I'm exotic now.


Ouch. Tell me what you really think, sis!


I told her that she was acting like some of the middle school kids at mine and my husband's work. Now she's saying that I'm bullying HER by saying that.


But is it true? Was my husband being a bully? It seemed like the other guy had a sporting attitude about being beaten, so I don't get why sister is so mad.
  

I realize she's proud of her boyfriend being fit or being a cage fighter or whatever but she should know that one shouldn't go around trying to act like you're tougher than everyone else, because eventually someone will check you.

I have what I consider to be a pretty happy update, but considering how many people would calling for me to divorce my husband in the last post, maybe you guys won't feel the same. 

We sat down and had long talk last night and again this morning.
I told my husband, in no uncertain terms, that this had been a huge breach of trust and I was in no way happy with the fact that he bought this house. I had called my parents before and figured out how much it cost them to renovate a lot of the rooms in their house, as well as how long they estimated it took. I showed him those numbers and I could tell that that made it really sink in just how much work he had signed himself up for.

All of this finally sobered him up and he apologized for doing this. He said he understands why I didn't want it, and he understood that I wanted no part in the renovations, but he still loves this house and thinks he can renovate it to the point that I will love it, too. And to be fair to him, the house does have nice bones. It's in a good area, and the idea of being able to hand-pick everything and change a few things around to exactly what we want does appeal to me a *little* bit. So I agreed to keep the house.

With that decision, though, comes the condition that he will be doing *all* the renovations by himself. It will come from his pocket, he will do all the work, deal with hiring any contractors needed, everything. We agreed on a few major things that need to be done by the end of this year to make the house livable without it being a total construction zone. The only involvement I will have in the renovations will be input on paint colors, flooring, and fixtures. If he has the major projects we agreed on done by the end of the year, we will move in and I have agreed that I will help a little, but the house will not take up all of our free time. As soon as it does, I am done. 

In the meantime, we will be keeping the apartment. That is where we'll be living for the rest of this year. We agreed on a maximum amount that either of us can spend without consulting the other person. He has agreed to go to marital counseling with me so that we can figure out a better way to communicate so that this never happens again.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still kind of pissed at him and won't be lovey-dovey for a quite a while, but I can be in the same room as him without wanting to snap his head off. He's still my husband and I still love him. Hopefully in 20 years this will just be something that makes me roll my eyes when I remember it. I'm not looking forward to the coming months of renovations, but I'm glad that I don't have to be a part of it. He can spend his weekends ripping up carpet and insulating walls. I'll be in the San Juan Islands whale-watching and getting drunk on vineyard tours. 

Thanks to everyone for your help.

Okay. I had no idea so many people would care so much about clay, I thought I would get like two comments. This really blew up. Thank you to everyone who commented, to all the people who told me how the process works, and for all of the general tips regarding clay, student financial aid, and general finances. A lot of people took time to read my stupid ramblings and type up a reply. I'm grateful. 

I also want to thank every single one of you who offered to buy me clay. You are all the kindest, most generous people ever. I just wouldn't feel right taking money to buy clay, when I don't even enjoy the medium. I also will go into more details below, but I'm not going to be taking the class anymore. 

To all of you who agreed with Mary and said that I'm not an adult because:

1. I don't have $10
2. I wasn't prepared coming to class (Gosh, if only I was psychic and knew my clay hardened)
3. I cried when someone yelled at me for not having money
4. I'm lying about not having any money, and I just wanted to be a bitch to my teacher

I would like to say that I'm glad none of you has ever been in this situation before. I put it clearly in my post (and my replies) that I didn't have $10 that day. I have money now! Fiance got paid, we're fluuuuuuuuuush with cash! I mean not really, but still. We're good! If I wanted to buy a shit ton of clay right now, I could. It just so happened that I ran out of money after paying the bills in the middle of the month, and I didn't see how it was a big deal because I wasn't expecting any purchases. It was probably a period of 3 or 4 days where I was OUT of money, and at that point it's easy to just hold out until one of us gets paid. I have an apartment, a computer, my bills are paid and I have food. I would say I am adulting, just by definition. For everyone telling me I need to sort that out, I AM. FFS I AM. Fiance got a better job, I'm looking for a better job. I KNOW I'M NOT IN THE BEST SITUATION, I'M WORKING TO FIX IT. JEEZ. 

For the clay, I stored it in my locker the entire semester with no problems so far. The outside would maybe be a little stiff, but being new to clay (at least, new to fancy high-fire sculpting clay), I thought it was normal. I would just spray it and squish it until it was manageable. This was the first time the entire block felt like a rock, and I couldn't move much of the clay. I didn't know what the procedure was here, so to all of you saying that it's easy to google and find out, guess who doesn't like phones in her class? Also, why would I google it when I have a supposed clay expert two feet from me? I picked up my bag, felt the clay, and asked Mary for help because my clay was hard. That was it. I didn't say, ""Mary. My clay is ruined. Get me new clay or I'm not participating in your stupid class."" I also wasn't taking her away from her lesson, because she had just finished demonstrating something. People were picking up their clay and getting started on the assignment, so I wasn't taking her away from my other classmates and I certainly wasn't disturbing anyone. According to many of the ceramicists(?) here on reddit, hard clay is an easy fix. She could have showed me how to fix the clay. She could have TOLD me how to fix the clay, and left me to do it on my own. She could have told me that without clay, I can't participate and my grade will be docked. She could have simply said, ""Can you go get more clay?"" And I would have probably said ""Not today, but if you want I can model for my partner today and I'll have clay on Thursday.""

So on to the update. I spoke to my other trusted teacher, who happens to be the chair of my major's department. I came up to him and said, ""I know it's not YOUR department, but as a department chair, I was wondering if I could get your advice. It's about a teacher."" And he just gestured me outside to where we could talk. At first I tried to be vague, and not single out who the teacher was since it's not his department, but I was struggling with what I was trying to say. He asked me to tell him who it was and what happened, so I did. I teared up a little bit, felt stupid, but he totally validated my feelings. He said she was unprofessional and classless, that she should NOT have done what she did. He said I confirmed what he already thought of the teacher. He also told me (he used to go to school for ceramics) that she is not even using the right clay for figure sculpture. She's using ceramics clay, and it isn't necessary or easy when it comes to sculpting people.

I asked what I should do, because it's his certificate I'm taking the class for. He told me we would find some other alternative for those credits, or I could wait it out until the department takes the class from her and gives it to someone who deserves it. He advised that I should drop the class, because as a teacher, you start to be in danger when your enrollment drops. You get looked at, you get questioned, evaluated. He basically said, fuck her. If she's going to be that unstable and treat me like that, she doesn't deserve to have me in her classroom. She thinks she's teaching us some big life lesson when she gets mad about a late student, or when she yells at us about having hard clay, but she forgets where she is. A community college. We're there to learn, to try and better ourselves, and we're doing it despite being in a worse-off financial position. I shouldn't let someone like her discourage me from getting a certificate or a degree. So I asked if a complaint would make any sort of difference, and he just said it wouldn't. Unless there are a thousand complaints, then nothing will be done. Her file will be flagged, but unless it's a pattern, then she won't be fired. Being new to the class, however, might get through enough to where they take the class from her. He also told me that if he hears any other student having problems with her class like this, he will take it off of his certificate and replace it with something else. This would hurt her, because over half of those students were in there because of the same certificate I was. 

When I got home, I got an email from her. It said: 

""Teacherthrowaway1313

I am so sorry if I embarrassed you in front of the class. Please accept my apology""

Heartfelt, right?

So basically I'm writing a letter to the dean and dropping the class. I know a lot of you said how it would be cowardly of me, how I should walk back in with my head held high, and pretend that she can't hurt me, but this was the final straw. I was not learning anything from her class. When it started, I was really excited to learn how to work in clay and how to make little sculptures, to learn about more sculptors and their techniques, and none of that has happened. The only reason I was there was a certificate, and if I don't have to go back, I don't want to waste my time on her. I can spend my time focusing on my other classes and looking for a better job ;) I've been working on standing up for myself more (my roommate's friends wanted to crash on my couch for a few days, which of course turned into wanting to stay for a few months, and I shut that down before he was even done talking. Set boundaries, set expectations. Felt like a bitch, but a boss ass bitch). You win some, you lose some. Next time someone starts to yell in my face, hopefully I won't turn red and stutter apologies. Let them know it's not okay to talk to me like that, and give them a chance to correct themselves. But this time, I feel better just leaving it behind me. Thanks for your help, /r/relationships, you guys are cool :)

TLDR: Writing a letter to the dean, dropping the class. Finding alternative credits for my certificate, don't have to deal with Ms. Crazypants anymore. Also, am now flush with cash.

So I want to quickly thank everyone who shared all of their personal gaming stories with me as well as some interesting debates as to what level of gaming is considered addiction. Also sweet shout out to whoever decided to pm me and say that this was all my fault for making my boyfriend want to escape reality and play video games so much. I hope Jesus finds you before Chuck Norris does... sorry my ""sick"" burns still derive from middle school. 




So on to the update. After submitting the post I read through a lot of material on how to quell gaming addictions and help me explain my boundaries without forcing an ultimatum on my SO. So a day after I went out and bought books from a second hand store. I tried to get two copies of each. I went on Groupon and signed up for a ton of couple courses (fitness, painting, anything). I also cleaned out our refrigerator of a lot of ready to eat meals/snacks and purchased a lot of food that requires some prep ranging from 5 minutes to 30.



When he got home that night I cleared off our kitchen table and asked him if he'd sit with me, no electronics. We had a pad of paper between us and I asked him if he'd write out how much time on average he spends on certain activities during the week/weekend. Work was 40-45 hours, carpool was about 8 hours, weekday gaming 36 hours (hour before work, at least two hours cumulated at work, hour on the way home from work, and average of five hours once home into the night), misc activities an hour (chores and household or grocery shopping). Weekend numbers for gaming were more or less the same fluctuating between 40-45 (saturday, sunday, monday). I asked him to count ""quality"" time between us for the week. As in minimal electronics, cooking together, coffee dates, hiking, dog walking, engaging conversation, sex... it totaled to roughly five hours a whole week, including weekends. 


I then asked him to rank important aspects of his life. They could be in a more important first manner, or just ""here are 10 things that are all equally important to me"". I was the third thing written. His family and security (financial, home, auto are all rolled into that) were the first he thought of, but I'm ok with that. I'd rank my family first too until we are together a lot longer or married. Our dog, traveling, learning, and health also made the list. 


I showed him the list vs. how he spends his time. 


So I asked him to compare the list of things he thought were important to how he spends his time. And that's when the tears started. He asked me if this was my way of saying the relationship was over, and I told him no, but I need attention too. Living with your SO seems like an easy way to spend quality time, and I suppose it can be, but it doesn't mean you should stop ""dating"".




I asked him if there was any reason his video gaming had been increasing as five months ago he didn't play this much. He said that it started as him being a little depressed about our finances, his job being so high strung, and not being able to go out as much wanted because of the finances (traveling, expensive sushi, what have you). He also felt pressure from some of his friends to play more as this was all they did. We talked about my gaming and how he would like for me to play more but recognizes that the fun is taken out of it if he begs me to play every day and is a majority of what he talks about.  In the end the gaming just became a weird solace for him. At first he used it to escape his financial fear, but later it just became a safe space that he was used to. He described it like going to your grandmas when you're upset with your parents only to really recognize how much you love being in her home and how she comforts you... So you try and visit her as much as possible, anything that can kind of trigger sadness and it's off to grandma's. They're out of my favorite kind of chips at the vending machine? Time to play video games real quick so I feel good. 




So we made a plan. I made it clear that I don't want to feel neglected in a relationship for any reason, that I like video gaming with him but I need more stimulation from him than quality time via coop mode. I brought out the books I bought and showed him the groupons I found and we reworked our weekly schedule so that during those free hours he has other activities to try that I'll be doing too. We didn't completely cut out his gaming time but we made set amounts per day. Carpool? Play all you want or read. At work? minimize it as much as possible by reading or working on work related activities so a promotion and raise are in sight to help quell financial freak out nerves. At home? Activities as much as possible with the promise that Sunday's we play video games together for around five hours schedule permitting. 






So far there's been one hiccup. Not major, he told me immediately that he overplayed and would be deleting his apps to get rid of the temptation. He's trying some therapy to help cope and though it's early I think he really is working hard to make things better. He cooks with me and a lot more in general, we play card games, we have our own read at your pace book club (we read a book a week at this point; onto book four soon), and through our activities stay as busy as possible. On our gaming days we make pizza together and make snacks and get ready to destroy on coop mode. He likes being able to do coop more than gaming alone and says that having a big day with him and I is makes not playing as much during the week worth it. 











I'm cautiously optimistic at this point. It's great that he's throwing himself so heavily into everything else, but moderation is still key. Thank you all very much again for help and ideas.

Please do not misunderstand me; I do not regret having our son. I am not pining for ""the way things were before the baby"". The baby was/is entirely planned and wanted. We were both eager first-time parents.  I feel that I adapted to parenthood well, while my partner just... kind of didn't. He did minimal adapting, and as a result I now feel like a single parent with a lodger that occassionally ""babysits"" our son, if I ask him to. I feel let down by him. 


At first, I thought it could be just that he lacked confidence in dealing with a new born.. Now our son is nearly two and my partner is great at being fun with him, when he's ""on daddy duty"", but is still absolutely clueless about the rest of the things that he needs besides play. Caring that he's clean, fed and how much he has slept are exclusively mommy's problems. When I try politely inviting him to consider caring about these things, because it would help me out, I get told, a) he's shocked that I think that he doesn't care..? And, b) not to nag him because he gets enough pressure from work.


We met each other through work. I know his job. I had no idea that it was so very stressful that one couldn't possibly handle also being a parent. Seems like something that he should have brought up for discussion before committing to the deal. I still work part-time since becoming a mom. I do not, however, come home from work and think ""*feed and bathe my kid...? Nah... think I'm gonna ignore the kid and play on Rust for six hours, because I worked really hard today.""*


Aaand that's how he has been for nearly two years and he is not about to change. I have asked him to help more, do more. He might say that he will, but never does. A while ago I spent an unexpected four days in hospital.. I realised how much of an idiot I had been for not insisting on ""training"" daddy, because he did not even know how to feed our son. Completely oblivious to something that we do every day, he had to ask me what he eats. He also wants us to have a second child in the next year or two. I am close to telling him that I would have to be fucking insane to have another baby with him. I always did want 2 or 3 kids someday. He is reason why that plan is now out the window.

469,worriedmom92,Non-Romantic,448019,2273,"Before I elaborate I just want to say that neither me nor the rest of my family share my son's beliefs. I have no idea where they came from but I'm certain when I say it has nothing to do with how my husband and I raised our son.


My son went to college across the country and graduated last spring, and thankfully he got a very good job close to home o now he's back and living with us. On all fronts, he's doing great in life and is shaping up to have a very successful future. I've always considered him nothing short of perfect but recent events have taught me that my son holds incredibly disturbing beliefs.


My son has always been very protective of his younger sister (18F), she's currently in her last year of high school. Well, he found out a few days ago by looking at her texts (he said he wasn't snooping, but saw an unsavory text pop up and read further) about my daughter's sex life. Now I don't pry into what my daughter does in her adult life nor do I feel the need to, as my daughter practices safe and responsible sex. My husband and I both know she is sexually active but as she's going about it as an adult, in a healthy and safe way, we have no problem with it.


My son blew up and called my daughter all manner of horrible words, particularly ""filthy whore"" and ""putrid slut"", demeaning and humiliating her without mercy. I've never seen my daughter cry so hard, she was absolutely devastated especially since she adores her brother and looks up to him. He refused to apologize and then berated both me and his father for ""letting your daughter become a whore"".  


We were all shocked by this and didn't know how to react, really. It seemed so surreal like a scene in a movie, and his father asked him how he could say things like that. My son explained his beliefs and we learned he's frighteningly misogynistic and sexist and violent. For example, he believes all adulterers should be stoned to death and praises ISIS for doing so. He thinks modern women are all disgusting sluts and that there's no good women left. I don't want to list his other beliefs because just typing this makes me upset, but you get the idea.


We tried to reason with him but he simply won't budge on these horribly ignorant and harmful beliefs. Worse, he won't entertain any conversation about this issue with us as he believes he's completely right about these ideas. So for the past few days the atmosphere in the house is incredibly tense. He's carrying on like everything is normal but both my husband, my daughter and myself are constantly in disbelief that he could be like this. I have no idea how to even broach this topic again without him shutting me down instantly. I've raised my son to be open-minded, a true gentleman and I'm saddened that he completely abandoned that. What do I do? How do I even go about restoring the family life we used to have?

So, I don't really know where to start. It's almost a decade of my life and I could write about it for days, but I'll try to pick out the unimportant bits.
I [23F] have been with my boyfriend [28M] for 8 years. 

I know it's pretty much impossible to paint a good picture of someone through a few paragraphs of a story, especially considering I'm mostly pointing out problem areas, but please keep in mind that he's a good person. He's loving, gentle, cares about me than anything and absolutely devoted to me. But we have tangled this relationship into quite a mess.
Like everyone who posts here I have countless reasons to want to stay, but I'm having trouble taking off these rose-colored glasses. Please help me, Reddit.

**Backstory:** 
When we started dating I was going through a lot of shit, and he was the first guy I have ever been with. I was the one who was always compromising and always finding ways to go see him. He very rarely came to see me, and if he did he would get irritated and complain that he shouldn't have to. He would ask me to come over every single night, saying he missed me and he couldn't sleep. I lived about an hour away, and I didn't even have a car, so when I'd find rides to his house (bus, friends driving me, etc.) I was excited to see him. I'd get there early in the day, and instead of seeing him, I'd sit on his couch alone for HOURS while he played video games. It was infuriating, because I played games too, but he always told me not to bring my console because I could use his (he had literally zero games for it), but I always ended up just pacing around his house, waiting for him to give me a second of his time. As bad as this sounds (and it was), he was so sweet and sincere when he would finally get done, he told me how glad he was that he could keep up with his legion and still have a girlfriend (he said although he ended up breaking up with his last three because of fidelity problems, they hated him gaming.)

I was young and stupid, and caught up in being the cool girlfriend.

I used to have a lot of fun, going to clubs and parties and all kinds of things. I had a ton of friends, mostly male. He would get upset if I talked to them, even the ones I had known since I was a toddler, and he said that since he didn't talk to girls then I shouldn't either. (Little did I know, he actually was talking to a few girls all this time.)
	
He said I love you two days into dating, and proposed after a few months. I told him I wasn't ready, that I loved him but I was too young and I needed to get to know him better. He was different after this, like it hurt him for me to say no. 
After a few months together, I'd tell him I was about to do something (like walk to the grocery store since I had no car) and he would SCREAM at me over the phone. He said I was an idiot, going to get myself killed, women can't walk alone, especially near nighttime. I know what you're thinking, why would I stay with a sexist asshole?? Well, he had never made it seem like he was sexist before, and would deny saying it. He would say he never said any such thing, and that he was only worried about me. I'd ask why he screamed, and tell him it wasn't okay to treat me like that, and he'd say ?I have never and will never yell at you.?

At this point I'm already doubting my sanity, but the other 75% or so of the time, he's so incredibly sweet to me. I moved in with him about 10 months in because my mother died, and I had no where else to go. I had a job, but didn't make enough to support myself. His family owned farm land in the south, and had bought him his own house.

About a year into our relationship, I found out that he'd lied about every single thing he'd told me about himself. The way I found out was the worst part; he just told me. He forgot that he'd lied in the beginning, and he'd start randomly telling me things like, ?I almost married my high school sweetheart, but she changed her mind last second? and ?my tenth or so girlfriend calls me every weekend to say she wants to fuck.? This is after telling me that he's been with only three others before me, and that he doesn't talk to any exes. None of this would've mattered to me if he'd been upfront in the beginning, but because he lied and was using the whole ?I don't talk to girls, you can't talk to guys? bullshit to keep me from having male friends, I was pretty upset. 

A few weeks after that, I told him I was going to the movies with a female friend for her birthday. I told him the movie was at 7 and I'd be back before midnight. We wouldn't be drinking, partying, anything like that. Well,at about 9:30 I start getting horrible texts. I'm a ?lying bitch,? I ?better enjoy the dick I'm getting because I'm never getting [his]? again, and that he doesn't want to see me when I get home.
I was crushed. It was the first time I'd seen ANY friend since we started dating, and she had never met him, but she saw what he was sending me. I ignored him and ended up getting home at 11 pm. The house was trashed, and he was up waiting for me. When I asked what the hell he was talking about, he slammed the door in my face (literally, it hit me really hard in the nose) and screamed ?fuck off!?

I slept on the couch. The next day he left without saying a word to me for a softball game he'd been planning with his friends. I was still pissed, so  I called him as soon as I woke up (btw, he was OUT OF STATE, and would be sleeping in a motel room with multiple single girls/guys for the next five days) and I told him he's an asshole I'm done. He was absolutely desperate over the phone for me to give him another chance, but I hung up. I packed everything I owned and tried to leave, but he showed up right before I could and was very sincere about getting help. 

The next day, he stayed out until 5 am at a strip club and came back without his promise ring on. He said he'd put it in his pocket so he wouldn't lose it, but he smelled strange and was acting strange and I just know that he cheated. He vehemently denied it, saying I was insane for accusing him and that we should just break up if I wasn't going to trust him. I said okay, and started packing AGAIN. Then he said he'd never said any of that.

After the fight earlier, he said he'd go to therapy, stop punching holes in the walls, pay more attention to me and even let me go to clubs again and resume contact with my male friends. Well, he did start therapy. He went for three months, and nothing changed. He continued to punch and break things, scream at me, tell me everything was my fault and that he couldn't stand me. He turned to drinking and when he'd get violent and drunk, he said I was the reason he was forced to drink. Because I was causing him so many issues. Well, things got better then they got worse, they were up and down for a while but we had a good period of about four years. 

There were several large fights over the years, here a few that stand out:

The day my favorite aunt died, I was with her at the hospital. I drove a shitty vehicle there that was known for breaking down. After she passed I was a mess. I told him I was leaving and would be back soon. We lived only a few minutes down the street, but my car broke down and I was about 15 minutes late. I got home and he was furious, said I was cheating on him and that was why I was late, screamed that I was a cheater and the landlord who was our neighbor heard the whole thing, he always hated me after that. No apology after he calmed down, instead it was my fault for causing him to worry.

I was feeling depressed about the amount of porn he watched versus how often he was interested in me. We used to have a ton of sex, we had six different FFM threesomes with multiple girls he chooses and I tried everything to satisfy his kinks. But then I just stopped being enough. Hint; he preferred porn and good ol' Jennifer Haniston. (hmm it's not very funny in this context huh?) 
Guys, I have zero self-esteem at this point, and I'm just dreading waking up every single morning. 

One day, after a month of no sex, he locks himself in the bathroom and I can hear him in there, I get so sick to my stomach and have an anxiety attack (I'm a very in-shape, busty girl. I'm in gymnastics and have always been told I'm generally attractive, so it's not a weight issue or anything. I suspect porn addiction). I'm hyperventilating on the floor when he comes out, and he's sweet for a moment, asking what's wrong and to please talk to him.

Well, I trusted him and I shouldn't have. I told him in the most calm voice I could that it makes me feel sad when he chooses porn over me, that we've had sex 4 times in three months and I wish I had more from him.

He completely lost it. He grabbed my shoulders so hard his nails dug in, he shook me and screamed that he doesn't even watch porn, that he is so whipped by a stupid bitch, that his life is shit because of me.

I have always been very sensitive and I cry at the drop of a hat, I know that makes him feel like I'm trying to manipulate him. But even if I lock myself in the bathroom to cry, in private, it's still my fault and I'm using it to control him. I don't have anywhere to go, and I cannot NOT cry sometimes, is there something I could have done to show him I just need to cry sometimes?


**That brings us to now.**
Most of the year was good, but the past few months he's been screaming a lot more. He's told me that I am a horrible person for trying to leave him years ago, and that I don't deserve him and will never find another guy who'd put up with me. He always denies things and tries to make me sounds crazy, so this time I recorded it. Later when he was more calm I played it for him, and he accused me of inviting guys over the pretend to be him so I could get him in trouble. What the fucking fuck???

He's done much more. He's gone through every file on my computer and set the only dirty one he could find as my background to humiliate me because he knew his family was coming over. He wanted them to see the filthy shit I look at. Remember earlier how I said he has a porn addiction? Yeah, he's at a level of hypocrisy that I just can't understand. 

I know this is incredibly toxic and I am so sick of feeling suicidal.

I just wanted to know one thing; am I the one who is abusive? I know I didn't give very many examples of things I've done, and maybe if he posted his side you'd agree with him, but what about my trying to leave? Was that a horrible act of betrayal? Because he is convinced it's worse than cheating, and says he is abused and is a victim. I am just so confused and feel constantly devastated and lonely. I have no one if I lose him :(

Please, send help

TL;DR: Toxic relationship becoming too much for me to handle, and I'm confused about my role in it. Am I a horrible person? What do I do?

**Edit:** I guess it doesn't really make sense for me to ask if I'm being abusive since this is from my point of view and for all you know I could just leave what I do out, so I don't really know what I'm asking. I guess I just want to see what others think. I feel like I'm crazy.

471,jhasfkg,? Locked Post ?,3i02ws,2272,"I was home for the weekend when I received a text from Eric, my ex-boyfriend from high school. He and I attempted long-distance when I left for college last year, but I ultimately ended the relationship because I didn?t see it going anywhere. But I did still care about him, and breaking up with him wasn?t easy. 

He invited me over to a small party at a mutual friend?s house, so I went. I didn?t know what to expect. Maybe I would see him and change my mind about the whole thing, maybe I wouldn?t, but either way, I still decided to go because I missed him.

It was nice to see Eric again. A little while into the party I was fairly certain that I wanted to reconcile a friendship with him. As far as a relationship or anything of the sort, it still didn?t feel right. But catching up was nice.

There was a lot of alcohol and a lot of weed at this party. I?d never drank and smoked at the same time before, but I was with people who I trusted, so I thought I?d be fine. I was wrong; I smoked and drank so much that I lost track of how many drinks I?d had, to the point that I vomited and then passed out in the host?s (old friend from high school) bed. Or maybe it was just a really deep sleep. Either way, I was completely out.

I woke up with my dress pulled up and my ex having sex with me. It hurt. I was completely dry. It took me a moment to register what was happening, but once I realized, I tried to push him off. He was heavy and stronger than I was. I was still having trouble even keeping my eyes open. I told him to stop (slurred, more like) and he acted like he didn?t hear me and just kept going. He finished (pulled out and came on my dress) and left the bedroom without saying a single word to me. I was laying in the bed, my dress still hiked up, trying not to pass out again, but I did. 

I woke up to him bringing another girl into the room and having sex with her while I was half-conscious in the bed next to them. I felt so disgusting. When I completely woke up around 6:00 AM, everyone was still sleeping, and I just left. I?m home now, with a hangover from hell.

Emotionally I?m a mess. I don?t know what to do. I don?t know if I should tell someone. I feel like I should, but I don?t know who. Not to mention that I was drinking while underage and on drugs when it happened. And he was drinking, too. A part of me just wants to forget about the whole thing, but this really doesn't feel right.

TlDr: Ex invited me to a party. Got very drunk and very high, to the point of passing out. Woke up to him having sex with me and wouldn?t stop. Passed out again. Woke up to him bringing another girl into the room and having sex with her as I lay next to them in the bed. Woke up again, drove home, at a loss for what to do now, or if I should do anything at all.

Putting this up top because the post might get lengthy: 
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend continually insulted my lady parts. I tried to talk to him, but he just made excuses and blamed his behavior on me, so I broke up with him.

This morning I decided to sit my boyfriend down and explain how hurtful his comments had been. He became very defensive and stated that the labia comment was meant as a compliment. Furthermore, he expressed that he thinks I'm far too sensitive, lack self confidence, and that nobody else would be bothered by his ""negging"". From the responses friends have given me when I've mentioned this (and from the comments on my previous post), I really don't think that's true. Constantly picking apart your significant other's appearance is the abnormal behavior. 

His reaction really drove home for me how selfish and insensitive the dude is. I could name numerous situations during the course of the relationship where he played the martyr, disregarding my needs and feelings entirely. 

Cases in point (All entirely true- sadly):
* He managed to break a sex toy (that he had purchased and that I hadn't even wanted to use) so forcefully that it cut me ""down there"". I got to go to urgent care bleeding from the vajayjay and he texted me saying how much it ""sucked that he hadn't gotten off"". 

*He demanded to use my laptop to play video games while on vacation, caught the charger cord with his foot while he flailed around playing World of Warcraft, and smashed it to the ground. He had a fit when I asked him to pay for the repairs and went home 10 days early (without me).

*He wore threadbare gym shorts to my grandfather's funeral and watched porn on his phone during the service.

Point being, the guy's a selfish, disrespectful jerk. I put up with it for far too long and I'm just done. Nobody's significant other should make them feel as crummy as he did me. I hope that he is able to change his behavior and find happiness in a relationship in the future. As for me, I will take my ""lady garden"" somewhere that it will be appreciated in future. Thanks to all who commented. Your kind advice helped me see what I needed to do.

I remembered posting here, and decided to give an update after 1.5 years.

TLDR of last post: Brother did crimes which got him sent to prison and that was the start of a chain that destroyed our family and left my parents dead. He's out now. Not sure if I should start contact.

I decided to go and see him. I talked to my uncle first and he told me that my brother is acting great, doing good work and is being very reasonable about everything. He also said he's asked about me but kept his distance out of respect, since I stopped visiting him in prison.

When I met him it wasn't easy. I had some unresolved feelings and I ended up shouting at him a little, but also eventually ended up crying in his arms. We talked for hours and hours that day. The more we talked the more I realized how much I missed him and having him in my life, and also how little I knew about our parents. They were horrible to him, really abusive.

Our father used to hit him. I remember him crying in his room sometimes. I always teased him and mocked him for it. I was a lot younger and didn't know what was going on, but I have vague memories that I mostly hurried but now they made a lot of sense. I even remember our dad went to his room with a belt. My mom told me he wanted to see if it fits on my brother's pants. I was 12 I think. I believed it and ever thought twice. No wonder he was acting out and was troubled. I know it doesn't excuse what he did that left him in prison but it adds some context.

When I visited him in prison early on, he would always ask me if our parents are treating me well. They were to be fair, they never abused me. Or if they did I don't remember. I thought he was trying to badmouth them but he was worried about me. He apologized to me that his stupid mistake ended up separating us because he had promised himself to keep me safe and to help me when I turn 18.

Our grandma confirmed the abuse as well when I talked to her. She knew about it and did nothing. She told me my mom didn't kill her self because of what my brother did or my dad's repulse, it was over guilt for not doing anything to end the abuse that my brother suffered for years. My view of my parents have changed completely. 

To make it short, we decided to restart our family with a clean slate. We promised to love each other and take care of each other. We've both been to therapy as well. We missed a lot of years but we have a lot of time ahead of us. 

It's so good to have a family again! I've had friends in these times but never had someone who knew everything about me. Someone I could trust and always rely on. And being that person to someone else. Now I have that and it's amazing. We talk on most days and see each other at least once a week. He's still working in the farm with our uncle and is doing a good job. But I convinced him to go back to college and get his degree. He began this semester. He's also staying away from alcohol completely and I'm doing the same. Both our parents had an alcohol problem and he did something horrible while drunk and our uncle has also been having DUIs, people in our family should not be drinking. I never had a problem with alcohol but I think doing it together is just easier for him and me.

So overall, life is good. And I'm really hopeful for our future! Thanks for your help especially those who gave me the courage to step up and meet him.

475,Ringdrama34,Non-Romantic,4umydj,2263,"I've been with my fiance Michael for almost four years now and it's been a great relationship so far. He proposed a month ago and we are both really excited to start our lives together. Hes truly wonderful. His family, well... :/

Michael does not live in the same state as his family anymore and as a result I've only met his family a few times. He has said before that some of his family members can be weird and he was even hesitant for me to meet his siblings. 

His siblings (both girls) are apparently really spoiled rotten individuals. Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in  at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more) Michael was rarely allowed to attend social events at school or go out on weekends. he did all chores and his parents treated him very different than his sisters. His sisters were incredibly mean to him as teenagers. Basically he was pushed around like a literal peasant until he had enough money to move out and was able to receive grants and scholarships to go to school. It was a lot of luck that played a part in his being able to attend undergrad and grad. If not for outside help, I believe his family would have left him to rot whilst giving the sisters everything they ever wanted. 

Michael is now an engineer while his sisters have basic minimum wage jobs (nothing wrong with that) however his sisters have done all they can to pester Michael about borrowing money, making him feel ashamed that he makes more money than they do, and even going as far as to claim that they deserve the money more than Michael does. They ask him monthly for money, which I just learned a year ago after Michael confessed to me in shame that he had been giving them money to help them through a rough patch for the past few months. 

Apparently their mom and dad has refused to continue to support them to the large extent that they have been the past several years (maybe they finally got fed up, who knows) and now the sisters are looking to Michael. 

Tina, Michaels eldest sister, is being really difficult lately. Apparently, she is bitter that Michael has not been giving her anymore money. And she is acting very strange about Michael's engagement. Apparently, Michael ""should he thinking about his family first"" before thinking of getting married and spending a bunch of money on a wedding and a wife. His sisters should be put first, apparently.  Now, supposedly she is pissed over my engagement ring. 

This past weekend Michael and I went to visit the family and Tina and the whole family obviously learned about our recent engagement. I had never even met Michael's dad before because he travels so much for work. His mom seemed passive towards me and his dad kept asking me what my name was. It made me sad tbh. 

Tina remarked on the large size of my engagement ring. Later in the day, she pulled Michael aside and told him that she was really suffering financially along with the rest of the family, and basically said. She was shocked Michael was forking over thousands of dollars for my engagement ring and the wedding rather than help out his own family. She said ""you've only known this chick for what, a few years? You're already giving her everything while you give your own family nothing."" 

Well, Michael then informed her that my ring wasn't real diamond. It is moissanite, which I specifically wanted instead of a diamond. Michael could easily afford a diamond but we are saving our money and I liked the idea of moissanite. 

But, Tina didn't believe that and expressed such. She stalked over to me in the kitchen and made a huge scene in front of everyone asking to see my ring, and examine it. She tried to play it off jokingly but I could see through it, and at one point she made a grab for my left hand. I refused to hand over my ring and Tina got emotional and the other sister, Hannah, soon butted in and asked what my problem was, Tina just wanted to look, what do I have to hide, etc. I just tried to calm the situation down as best I could and Michael kept telling them to mind their own business.

Honestly, the whole thing was infuriating. We left after dinner to go stay in a hotel. Michael then told me how he thinks his sister is also jealous of me and my ring. Tina has  been engaged for over a year now with still no wedding planned, she was given a tiny ring. Albeit with a real diamond but it is very tiny. Mine, though fake, is big and sparkly and she remarked to him once that he had better not get me a prettier looking ring than she had. (Wtf?) Michael and I will be getting married fairly soon and she seems bitter that her own fiance has still not expressed a desire to start planning the wedding. She has also remarked in the past to Michael how I am too beautiful, and that my looks are somehow suspicious, and I'm just out to get his money. 

I make my own money as a nurse and I definitely am not using Michael for his money. 

Now, Tina has started creating all sorts of drama over this, posting on Facebook about how real men should know where their priorities lie, how real men stick by family and don't play with little girls who are gold diggers who only care about having a huge rock. One status said ""show me the paperwork and I might believe the ring isn't real lol"" and another one was some stupid quote about being distracted by shiny things that turn out to be coal in disguise. (Me I'm guessing lol) she commented ""lmao ???"" on my instagram picture of my ring. I deleted the comment.

I only know this about her Facebook statuses because Michael showed me through his account. Tina deleted me off of everything and even blocked me. She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me and then listing all of the reasons. (I don't really love him. I'm a gold digger, Michael doesn't care about his family anymore) 
However at the end of the email she said she may consider believing Michael if she saw proof that my ring wasn't real.

Reddit, I'm at a complete loss as to what to do here. Michael is also shocked but not really because he is so used to his sisters' antics. He took my side and I appreciate that but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant. I think he just doesn't wanna create more drama. But I need him to draw hard lines here.

The thing is, I don't want Tina and Hannah coming along every few months asking for money and judging us. I don't want my marriage to involve their pettiness and begging. I won't give any of my hard earned money to them, that's for sure. I don't want Michael to either but I guess I can't force him not to. I just worry because that could be money our future children need. Or money WE need. 

How can I handle this situation? At this point I never wanna see the sisters again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44czp3/hubby_of_10_years_35m_just_told_me_hes_planned_a/

The tl:dr of the initial is: husband had a ski trip planned for a long time, guy he was going with cancelled at the last minute. Husband asked his life long family friend who is 22, gorgeous, Instagram model to fill in. I was upset, husband cancelled the trip. I felt guilty and got trip back on with the room upgraded to a suite. And they went.

**update**

So Graig and Shelby just drove up to the house. Graig is getting ready for work and Shelby is actually taking a nap in our guest room since she drove most of the night. 

The trip went very well and they both had a great time. As for me being insecure, Graig did everything I asked of him to reassure me that there was nothing at all inappropriate going on. He called multiple times a day and we skyped for maybe 15-20 minutes a night almost every night. I got a good idea of the room lay out and saw that even though they were sharing a suite, they both had plenty of privacy. 

I did have one moment early on where the reality of my husband sharing a hotel room with an Instagram model in her 20s sort took my breath away but it wasn't Shelbys faullt. Me and our 9 year old son were on Skype with my husband and I saw Shelby in the background wearing a swimsuit getting ready to go to the hottub. When she realized my son was on skype (they have a very playful, almost ""flirty"" relationship) she leaned over my husbands shoulder and said something like ""Hey AJ, I'm going to destroy you in HALO when I get back."" But her boobs were basically right on graig's shoulder with her ample cleavage in full view. In my brain I was thinking ""buster if your eyes so much as look left...it's over."" But Graig didn't even flinch which made me realize that to him seeing Shelby in a bikini really is like seeing his sister or cousin.

So all in all they had a great time. Graig has since left for work and I'm sure I'll chat more with Shelby when she wakes up for her drive across town. 

As for me I've spent the last two weeks really dedicating my self to lose weight, get healthy and be passionate about something again. I've signed up for a 60 day challenge at our local hot yoga studio and have been going every day. I've started using myfitnesspal to count calories (I'm astonished at how much I was actually mindlessly eating for years). And in two weeks I've lost just under 5lbs which makes me feel really great.


**tl;dr**: husband just got back from his ski trip with his young family friend. I was super insecure about but it turns out it was a good experience for them and hopefully a transformative experience for me


Edit (about 1230 original post was at 7am) I had no idea this would blow up again but thank you again. Shelby just left to go to her apartment after we sat and chatted a bit. She is an amazing girl and I get zero hint that anything went on (just adding this for the people who think she and Graig are shady). She was so appreciative and she's going to baby sit for us whenever we need it and do a girls day at a spa in Denver with me when the ski season is over and her weekends free up.

What's crazy is how this and my last posts comments are so split down the middle. To just answer the most common questions comments:

1. I was really kidding about him looking at Shelbys bikini...if he looked he looked but it was still a little shocking to see another woman's more intimate parts so close to my husband. The hot tub pool was for the entire hotel so as far as I know they were never there alone, at least for very long. I should add that Shelby had a towell around her waist.

2. I didn't go or have the option to go because we have kids in school and Graig booked this trip last summer. They were leaving Sunday and his friend cancelled Friday so it was far to late to make two week child care plans. He asked Shelby (as opposed to other people from that group of friends) because she's the only one really on his level of skiing. 

3. Upgrading to the suite cost me $50 a night extra and...which was not cheap but trying to get two rooms would have been $450 a night extra. This was the best compromise I could come up with. 

4. I'm still insecure but I'm working on it. I'm not sure if I need therapy or need to just get something in my life other than kids/husband to look forward to. I was in quite a rut. The hot yoga has really helped because it's challenging and I've made new friends. 

Thank you again for all the comments...the positive and the negative. I'm not a great writer so the people who like how I handled this will continue to and the people that didn't like what I did won't--just trust I handled this the best way I knew how.

Well, it looks like many of you were right.

She has a personal trainer.

Yes, thankfully, it actually WAS a personal trainer.  I'm so relieved and you guys are way smarter than me.  

She came home from work last night and I told her I needed to ask her something, could we sit down and talk.  She looked worried but agreed right away and asked me what was wrong.  I told her I had read her message and asked her to please explain it to me.  Comprehension washed over her face and then a look of pity.  She said she had joined the gym down the street because her work gym is terrible, and she signed up for a personal trainer because they were having a deal and she wanted to be held accountable.  She showed me her sign up sheets and keycard and even pulled up the gym website and showed me her little calendar spots for her training sessions with her personal trainer, whose name is of course Jeff.

She apologized profusely and said she didn't mean to scare me.  I asked her why she hadn't said anything and she said it was because she wanted to make some progress first, which honestly, is very much like her.  When she's trying to do a project she does not like to draw attention to it until it's done.  I think that ""ta-da"" moment motivates her.

So everything is ok because I asked her what was up.  I would've updated last night but we went out with friends.

HOLY JEEPERS that escalated quickly!!!

I've never broken up with anyone before. I've been dumped or parted ways mutually but ... I summoned up all my courage and called BF to meet up. 

To those of you who warned me to be prepared for gaslighting...you were spot-on. Thank you for the warning.

I told him I was tired of being pimped at home, tired of arguing about whether it was appropriate for him to pimp me at home, and that I'd spent far too much time fighting him over the issue. I told him while the questions were annoying as all hell, the fact that I'd repeatedly explained to him that it was stressful for me yet he continually disregarded that and tried to shame me into doubting myself was the bigger problem, and that his lack of respect for my comfort was a dealbreaker.

He informed me that:

1. He knew this was coming because I've always been an intellectual snob and his family had warned him about me from day 1.

2. He'd been wanting to dump me for months but he knew I needed his support throughout med school so he couldn't leave. Because he's a good guy and he would have felt so bad abandoning me.

3. Everyone in medicine either suffers from narcissism, autism, or OCD, so he's glad he doesn't have to interact with me or any of my friends anymore.

4. Law school is harder than medical school, lawyers are smarter than doctors, and he will always be needed but I'll be replaced soon by Watson.

5. He wishes me luck dying alone and becoming one of those sad lonely old lady doctors who has to resort to banging my residents for sexual relief.

My mind is fucking blown. I went home and cried and threw up. What the fuck piece of shit did I fall in love with???? I've never seen that side of him. I'd seen anger but not .... that. I don't know guys. I'm overwhelmed. I really thought when I posted the original question that there'd be more of a debate. Like expected some people to say oh he's just curious it's innocent, and expected to find some people be like tell this dude to STFU. I was really blown away by all of you being able to identify and verbalize and validate what had been feeling so goddamn confusing and shitty over here.

Hasn't been the most productive study day, but I'm going to go try and get some work done and at least enjoy the peace and quiet.

479,ellmairm,Relationships,7dueah,2254,"My husband is annoyed because I've decided not to attend Friendsgiving. It's a tradition among our friends and we've participated in the past but this year I'm not up for it. 

The main reason is that our son is only five weeks-old. I'm pretty much recovered physically from my c-section but my mind and body are still **tired**. Our pediatrician said it's important to make sure people wash their hands before touching him because we're entering cold & flu season. I don't want to have to worry about it all night or be ""that mom"" reminding everybody to wash their hands. 

There are other, less significant, reasons too. Most of our friends don't have kids yet. I can't/don't want to drink alcohol, which is always a major part of our Friendsgiving. Being the only sober person by the end of the night will definitely be annoying. The couple hosting this year also have two dogs and three cats, the house is covered in pet hair and the animals climb all over people and the furniture. It's uncomfortable for me because I'm allergic to cats and I don't care for animals climbing on and/or licking me. I wouldn't be happy if one of the pets was all over the baby and it's possible he has allergies too.

**I just don't want to go.**

During my pregnancy my husband frequently reminded me he didn't want the baby to change everything or become the center of our lives (lol). I believe this is why he's annoyed about Friendsgiving. We got into an argument earlier and I brought this up, I told him he's being unrealistic, which apparently really bothered him. I told him he can do whatever he wants but I'm staying home. I have no desire to attend this year and I think he could try harder to have some empathy, I just had a baby FFS. He's so paranoid about our lives *god forbid* changing that he's failing to recognize he's being inconsiderate and causing me to feel some resentment towards him.

I love my husband and I don't like feeling this way about him. I don't know what to do here. I understand his concerns but holy shit, he needs to back off, our son is **five weeks old**. 

Do you think I'm wrong to want to stay home? 

How can I help him see this from my perspective? I want to spend Saturday night relaxing at home, snuggling with my baby, and maybe preparing for actual Thanksgiving. Socializing is the farthest thing from my mind and actually sounds overwhelming and stressful. But he doesn't see it this way. It's all about me being a boring mom now and not trying hard enough to be the 'cool' wife/mom/friend. 

**Update**: We talked a little last night when he came home. I acknowledged his feelings and concerns and assured him I think they're completely valid. However, the way he communicates with me on this issue needs to change (and he agreed). I told him he's pushing me away and I'm growing resentful. I also mentioned how I'm afraid to be vulnerable with him because I worry he'll just criticize me. It was late so we didn't talk long but he seemed to understand. He apologized for being so hard on me about this and he said he didn't realize it was taking such a big toll on me. We'll definitely have more in-depth conversation about this soon. **Thank you for all of your help, reassurance, and kind words.**

Also, because people asked about these things:

- I do take the baby out. I think fresh air is good for babies. I tend to avoid taking him to places indoors with a lot of people, though.

- My husband is a good dad. He takes care of our son and spends time with him. He has him on a blanket in the backyard right now (doing tummy time).

- Maintaining a social life is important to me. Being a mom is part of who I am now but it's one aspect of my life. Our son needs a lot of my time and attention and I *want* to give it to him. But that doesn't mean it will be like this forever. I don't think it's unreasonable to give a new mom time to enjoy loving on the baby and that doesn't mean that's all she'll ever want to do going forward. I actually said this to my husband last night and I could tell it resonated with him.

Since a lot of you were wondering what happened. 
After not being home since 11am till the next day at 7pm, I went to my moms place around 5ish because I was so shaken. I was going to have a panic attack. I called everyone who I thought would know where he is but no one did. I was thinking about filing a missing persons report like some of you said but by that time it was 7 and he called me saying he was home and literally hung up the phone. I got there as fast as I could.

I get in the house and most his shit is packed, so I assume he came in before. I started crying and he just sat on the couch while I yelled at him. He said absolutely nothing . just when I started feeling bad, the friend we saw at the wedding comes out my bedroom holding boxes. I lost it and yelled at him. Called him every fucking name in the book. My husband tried telling me stop but I told him I wouldn't until he told me what was going on. I told him to tell his friend to get out of my house so we could discuss it. So he left.

I asked him if he was gay and he said he is but didn't know how to deal with it. Apparently, he married me because I was in love with him and he ""felt bad"". When I asked if he cheated on me, he said yes, with the same friend. They met at a bar and slept together. The friend didn't know he was married and wanted a relationship. My husband said he fell in love with him and wanted to be with him but couldn't so they drifted apart a year later. The wedding was the time they met after all that time and That's when he realized my husband was married.

He told me he initially left to give his friend (Matthew) a piece of his mind for telling me, but I'm assuming he went there , fucked him, and then they took a shower and slept together because he was dressed in someone else's clothes and clearly looked well slept and fine. Better than before actually. While I looked like an absolute mess with bags under my eyes and my face was fucking breaking out.  I have never been so infuriated and sad in my entire life I have absolutely no energy left in me. I told him to take his stuff and we're getting divorced. And all he said was ""I'm sorry it has to be this way but at least be a little nicer to Matthew for forcing me to come out so we can each be happier"".  So he clearly cares more about him than he ever did about me and I'm apparently a pity case. He left with his new boyfriend and I'm certain theyre moving in together now. I have been sitting on my bed crying my eyes out and having a massive headache since then. I really don't know how to live without him, I love him and despite all of that, hes done so many amazing things and I honestly can't let go. I don't live at our place anymore even though he said I could have the house. I've been staying at my moms place because everything reminds me of him. Before he left he told me he did love me, just in a ""different way"". I don't know what to do anymore...

Thanks for all the kind words and advice, it was comforting to read.

We live together and mostly live off my pay while he stretches what he makes in the summer. Neither of us have ever owned a car because it isn't necessary where we live. 


We both walk or take the public everywhere to save money. In the morning we stop at a corner shop shortly before splitting up for the day. He buys cigarettes and coffee. I buy fruit for my lunch and, on the weekends, lotto tickets.

The day I won he answered me with ""Fine, keep it all! It's not like I'm crying over a penny of nothing over here.""

I used to dress like shit, I was perfectly content wearing my gym clothes everywhere and stretched the dress code as much as possible for work. My girlfriend works in the fashion industry so she helped me buy some clothes that fit me better and looked nicer without being out of my comfort zone so I was really thankful for that. I kept all the same gym clothes, sweatpants, Panama pants, old t shirts and sweaters and jeans etc as well as all of my shoes because I figured they'd be fine to wear around the house or to work out because I don't really care how I look for that. I told her she could buy clothes for me if she wants because she knows what I like which is maybe where I went wrong. 


Last week I went on training for work and it was my birthday while I was gone. I got back and my girlfriend had  donated all of my old clothes that she hadn't picked out and replaced it with new stuff. I tried to act grateful at first but honestly I'm fucking pissed off. I don't want to wear shitty stiff jeans that stain the seats in my truck blue and the running shoes suck for actually running. Even the sweatpants are kinda tight which in my mind defeats the purpose of wearing sweatpants. She got rid of all my old t shirts that I bought at games and replaced them with plain colours but now I have barely any tshirts at all. And she spent a ton of money doing this. I know the jeans alone are over $300 and and the shoes probably cost over two grand. She gets a small discount on this stuff but still, she probably spent upwards of 5k on all the new clothes, I looked up some of the brands and it's all really high end. 


I told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had to but offered to go get it back from the thrift store. Well the thrift store apparently sends their donated clothes away to get wasted and then they get sent to various locations throughout our city so basically no one has any idea where my clothes are and they're as good as gone. 


The reason I'm posting is she's now mad at me for being ungrateful and says I'm being shitty and should respect and appreciate her more. But yeah I'm not really that thankful because she got rid of all my shit. Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find but it caused a huge fight.

I logged on this afternoon to find 300 + replies and messages to my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uj509/my_26f_fiance_28m_slept_with_my_sister_32f/). I am unbelievably touched by the all people who reached out to me, particularly /u/fractalfay's incredible response which spoke to me on a level I didn't think possible from a stranger. I'd like to thank each and every single person who took the time out of their day for me; I was so overwhelmed that I've not responded to a single one as of yet but it is truly truly appreciated.  

Now onto the update.

It has only been a day or so since I made my post, but it feels like I'd been in that hotel room for weeks, crying in the dark buried under the covers. At some point this morning, I decided to draw the curtains open and let the sunlight in. I went and sat on the balcony and switched my phone on for the first time. It started ringing within 30 seconds. It was my mother, who burst into tears as soon as I answered. Her and my parents had obviously been desperately worried (this is the longest I have ever gone without contact) and had even contemplated calling the police had I failed to contact them by this evening. 

My mom informed me that as I was walking out of Sara's room, down the stairs, and out the front door, Sara was screaming and wailing that she's sorry. Funnily enough, I didn't hear this. I don't know how. I think I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't process anything around me. Honestly, I can't even remember the drive home. After I shut the door behind me, my mom (who was the only other person at home) rushed into Sara's room to find her trashing her room and attempting to slash her wrists with a blunt lino cutter of all instruments (Sara used to do a lot of art). Obviously, this barely caused a scratch but jump started my mom into action. She drove Sara to the hospital, where I understand she underwent some sort of assessment and was kept overnight. She has, incredibly, agreed to undergo treatment for whatever it is that is wrong with her. My mom was surprised she was so complaisant on the drive down, willingly entering the car and saying nothing other than asking where I am. 

Sara seems resigned and completely deflated; my mom spoke to me at length for the first time in my life about the hardships they had undergone during Sara's childhood. I am unwilling to go into detail and am still in shock about some of the things I heard. Sara is not devoid of responsibility; she has long surpassed the age where she can blame her childhood for her behavior, but my mom admitted through tears that not sending her to therapy at an early age was the biggest regret of her life so far. 

I asked my mom if she knew why I had left; she admitted that she had known SINCE SARA'S EX LEFT TWO MONTHS AGO. At this point, I had to struggle not to hang up and I suddenly felt myself going back into that pit, but she begged me to listen. After her ex Harry (I am too drained to invent a name...hi Harry) left, Sara told my mom exactly what had happened. It was not the reason for Harry's departure, although he did know about it. Rather, he had had enough of being Sara's carer, and years of begging her to seek help had fallen on deaf ears one too many times. When Sara informed my mom, my mom told Sara I have to know immediately. Sara refused to tell me, and I still don't know why she changed her mind in that moment. My dad doesn't know for anyone wondering, and thinks I've left as I've also finally had enough of Sara's behavior.

Now here is where the home truths came out. I asked my mom if she knew the details. She was reluctant to tell me anything, stating that it had happened and that was all I needed to know. But I told her I refused to step foot in the house until I knew everything. She then proceeded to tell me that a few months before they slept together, Sara and Jake had kissed at my dad's 60th birthday party. It was a large family gathering with a lot of alcohol involved. I remember Jake getting very drunk with my cousins. Sara had a crying tantrum prior to arriving as her and Harry had an argument and he refused to come (she called me sobbing before she arrived). At some point during the night, Jake asked her if she was okay and hugged her, and once again ""one thing led to another"" and they shared a kiss in the kitchen. Sara told my mom that they were both immediately remorseful and vowed never to speak of it again, but Sara deliberately sought him out the night they slept together knowing he was unlikely to turn her down. She openly admitted she did it to get back at Harry, who had cheated on her during one of their many infamous breaks. I don't think I even entered her thoughts.

At this point, I'd heard enough. We'd spoken on the phone for over four hours and I felt mentally drained and physically sick. Any hope I had of salvaging my relationship with Jake has completely gone. I feel the last 3 years have been tainted by their betrayal, and the many years before that I wonder: did he like Sara this whole time? Part of me doesn't even want to know.

It's worth noting he has made absolutely no attempt to contact me other than a single TEXT stating ""I'm sorry. Take as long as you need"". As if it's inevitable I will come back to him.

Things are still up in the air. I don't feel ready to check out of the hotel as I don't know where I'm going to go next. I feel my relationship with my mom has been rocked by these revelations. I don't know what's going to become of Sara. I have no idea what I'm going to do about me and Jake's flat, where I'm going to live. I don't even know if I have a job anymore. I just haven't showed up to work. 

But I know the truth and the smallest part of me is grateful for that. The rest of me is consumed by a pain I never imagined possible.

I guess there's nothing else to do now except wait and see how things unfold. But reading through your comments and messages have been more help than you can imagine, thank you thank you thank you. 

And for anyone who has have ever experienced symptoms like Sara's, or has been around someone who is so visibly troubled, I beg of you: seek help before it's too late.
  
**tl;dr**: I had a four hour conversation with my mom, who not only knew about Sara and Jake, but informed me that they had shared a kiss a few months prior to the event. I am still in the hotel, still heart broken, and have no idea what to do next. The only saving grace is that Sara has agreed to treatment and will not be in my life for the foreseeable future.",1448832903.0,[UPDATE] My (26F) fiance (28M) slept with my sister (32F).

Hi.

My dad got a phone call yesterday afternoon from the police department where my brother lives.

He shot himself and was pronounced dead at the scene. He left a note, saying that it wasn't anyone's fault and that his time had come. That was it. 

I'm not really..sure. My dad is flying up there tomorrow to claim the body and bring my brother home.

My mother is destroyed. Not really that much to update.

tl;dr - suicide, nothing on his note.",1444229354.0,Me [22m] my brother [23m] did not come to my wedding [Update..bad],0.92
485,woozlefangirl,Updates,4m36af,2248,"Hi everyone. Sorry I took so long to post but I got very busy, part of which was spent graduating college so I'm glad THAT's finally out of the way. Here is the link for those who need a recap:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j727c/i_22f_am_getting_married_soon_my_mom_had_an/

WARNING: This is a VERY long update. Also this post is probably going to get flamed. Judging how the comments went down as more time went on the longer my post was up, this is probably going to anger many people. But there were also lots of nice and helpful people too, especially u/RememberKoomValley.

So I was reading all the comments and the more time went on the more angry and upset I became. People eventually started saying why should parents always have to sacrifice for children, some said I was being a bridezilla and only caring about my day (of course I care! It's my wedding! It's supposed to be a once in a lifetime event that I want to share with everyone!), many people said my dad had depression and my mother's actions were so evil he was forever off the hook for good. Everyone was giving suggestions on how I could meticulously plan the days to rotate everyone and I felt like screaming.

Steve eventually told me to get off of Reddit because he hated seeing me so upset. I couldn't even say exactly WHY I was upset. I just was. Steve said maybe I should go back to my old therapist that I had when my parents got divorced and talk it out with her. To me, this seemed like a great idea. I called her up and asked to have an appointment, despite finals being right around the corner.

So I went and EVERYTHING came out. How much I hurt still from what Mom did and how we can never be close again. And honestly how ANGRY I am at my father. I never really realized it, but I've gotten so furious and resentful of him. How he never even TRIED to get out of his funk, how dejected he acted if mom somehow came up, how he never said anything DIRECTLY bad about her but subtly made me feel so guilty for loving her. Acting mopey, going from fine to depressed if she somehow came up, how I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him and how he gets a free pass because he got cheated on; Something that happens to tons of people every day.

I talked and talked and talked. I made a couple more appointments. I got through finals (I want to shout out to Steve here. He is the only reason I got through it all, passed, and got my degree. He is an incredible human being.)

The tipping point was my graduation day. Once again, my father made it clear Mom couldn't be sat near him and he couldn't be near her at all. I had to text her when she could come talk to me and had to text him once she left.

Her boyfriend was, of course, not invited. But it was so embarrassing having to contact the officials in charge of the ceremony and ask if my tickets could be changed so my parents could sit far away from each other. They were kind and understanding but that's when I began to get very very angry. My mom has no problem with my dad. She doesn't mind being near him even though she doesn't love him. I began to think how I'm going to have to rearrange ALL my milestones. My marriage, when I have children, my children's christenings and birthday parties...etc.

Graduation was miserable. I couldn't look in any one direction to see my family as I got my degree and walked the stage because they had to be spread out.

I had to make sure my phone was on me and fully charged so I could coordinate my mother and father's locations. It was so awkward mingling with one group and then my mother, knowing both groups were waiting to have their turn.

My brother interacted with my mother and he was kind of cold but cordial nonetheless. My mother made no complaints, didn't try to argue or force herself in there, and patiently waited for her ""turn"" even though I could tell she was dying to spend more time with me. Pictures had to be rotated. I couldn't have ONE with all my family in there. My father was constantly texting during my time with her asking if she had left yet and if he could come back now.

It seemed so...CHILDISH. Honestly, the rest of my family could tolerate my mother being around. After all, the divorce was YEARS ago. It's time to start getting over it and moving on with life. It was only because of my DAD that I couldn't relax and just be happy and enjoy my graduation with my family.

I was supposed to go to dinner with my dad, boyfriend and other family after graduation to celebrate. I told them I felt very sick and I needed to go home. I just didn't want to be around anyone anymore.

Steve just held me while I bawled my eyes out. I hadn't cried that hard in years.
I met with my therapist a couple more times. This is turning into a novel so I will summarize what I came to realize in therapy:

While the initial anger and hate I felt for my mom was real, I never stopped loving her. But, I felt like because my dad had been wronged, I had to take ""his side."" My dad has always made me feel guilty for loving my mother still. While his actions have never been overt, it has been very subtle manipulation. I felt like I had to give my dad cart blanche whatever he wanted because if I didn't I felt like I would lose him too. That he would reject and have nothing to do with me if I didn't practically ostracize my mother. My mother was at one point my best friend and that's gone. I couldn't stand losing BOTH my parents. So dad has gotten whatever he wanted. And I'm realizing that in a subtle way, Dad has been manipulating my brother and I to treat our mother terribly for years to punish her. My dad has always been a super passive aggressive guy. It's nothing new. He's always guilt tripped people and made these little comments that twist people up and hurt them. It's his form of control.

I love both my parents. My mother did a terrible horrible thing but my dad is no saint either. My mom was just more upfront about her awfulness.

My therapist and Steve also pointed out that if my dad IS truly depressed or emotionally damaged etc. he has never sought to get help for it. Instead he has projected his problems and pain onto everyone else and made it their burden instead of taking responsibility for himself and attempting to go on with life and that is not ok.

I called my mom and asked her over for tea.Steve left to give us privacy. I could list everything we said and talked about but it would make the post longer. Basically my mom never loved my dad and should never have agreed to marry him. My dad knew mom didn't love him but didn't care and insisted she would love him eventually. Some very eye opening things were said that made sense.

My mother never trash talked my dad (never has) but she gave insights as to why the affair happened. She says she understands it's no excuse for what she did and she is so very sorry for her own selfishness and weakness.

Basically both my parents are human and mistakes were made from both sides. My mom had the affair yes, but it's not like my dad was the perfect man either.

While I still will never again be close to my mom perhaps I don't need to be quite as harsh with her as I have been. We will still be low contact but I did decided I DO want her there for the wedding and for the birth of any children I have, etc. I love my mom. Always have and always will. She may not have been a good wife but she WAS an excellent mother and I don't want to cut her out completely. I think my kids lives will be more enriched having her in it.

My mother started crying when I told her she was invited to the wedding (even though I made it clear to her her boyfriend is not invited. She didn't argue with me on that at all) and said she thought I had asked her to my house to tell her I would NOT be inviting her and she had been prepared to accept that rejection and understand it. I did tell her that if dad was there she was to stay away from him and not try to mend any fences at my wedding. She says she understands completely and will mingle with my grandparents (her parents) and my aunts, uncles and cousins (her siblings and their children). I made it clear to my mother that if she even attempted to talk to dad or any of his family she would be thrown out. She agreed without question.

Steve and I had a final sit down before I called my dad. I asked him to please give me his honest opinion. Steve relented and said while he thought my mother had done the inexcusable, she actually seemed remorseful and willing to accept the consequences of her actions and to move on and that my dad, while a nice guy, came off as way too sensitive and just weak. He said that my dad didn't cheat but he had caused me a lot of pain and anxiety since the divorce and it made him very angry and it was getting hard to like or tolerate my dad and that his family felt the same way, that my dad was actually a master bully in disguise as a super nice guy.

I called my dad and asked to come over and that I needed to talk about something. I sat him down in his living room (so this talk was in his space where he could retreat if he needed to) and said basically
""Dad. I love you so so much. You mean the world to me. But after the fiasco of my graduation I've come to realize I have had enough of feeling like I have to pick sides for you and mom. I'm sorry what happened Dad. I really am. But that was 5 years ago. You lost a wife, but I didn't lose a mom. I'm sure you don't mean to, but you've been making me feel like I can't be close with you if I want to have any kind of relationship with mom.If it's still impossible to even be in the room with her dad, then maybe you need to talk to someone so you can start feeling better and not be in so much pain. Is there some kind of abuse that happened that you're not telling me about that makes this impossible?""

My dad seemed shocked and then started to get REALLY upset and basically said mom had never hit him or anything but that ""she cheated and broke his heart and that was reason enough to cut her out""

Dad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on, I didn't know what real love was and also implied it was MY fault and my brothers fault because ""if we weren't a part of their relationship he could move on"" but we always remind him of her and what they had, how because of us he can't make a clean break since she's in our lives etc.

I'm sure many redditors will disagree but this is my dad being typically passive. Insinuating that because my brother and I exist he can't get better because we are reminders of mother and it's our fault we exist so he can't cut her out totally. I realize that my dad thinks that if he can get me and my brother to cut my mom out, not only will he succeed in punishing her but he can have us all to himself and not have to share with her and deal with his hurt. He's getting us to do the dirty work for him so he doesn't have to take responsibility.

I told my dad that I loved him and wanted him at the wedding but Mother is invited. Her boyfriend isn't but she is. I told dad that I had talked to her and I promised him she would leave him alone and stay away from him and his family and could he not just put aside differences for a few hours to celebrate with me and Steve on our day?

He said absolutely not and that I was being unfair and insensitive and that my mom had poisoned me against him. That he wasn't the cheat and she needed to deal with what she had done and not come and by inviting her I was clearly supporting her cheating and that we couldn't be close if that was the case because I was being too much like her.

I had had enough. I stood up and said,
 ""Dad, Steve and I really want you there. You are free to come or not. I love you. But if you don't come, it will absolutely affect our relationship going forward. I am not doing anymore separate celebrations or events. People can either come or stay home for weddings, parties, births and whatever. It's getting ridiculous and I'm sick of being in the middle. The rest is up to you and Mom.""

Then I left. I haven't heard from my dad since. That's been hard, but I feel like I did the right thing.

I also called my brother and told him everything that happened. My brother was very quiet. He then said while he still hates our mom for what she did and thinks she's a whore that maybe there is more to this than he realized and that he thinks our dad is being a selfish jerk and needs to get over himself. He said it's fine mom is coming to the wedding and that he would be nice to her.

So that's that. I'm sure many will disagree and be angry with me but Steve and I feel we made the right call. Steve loves and supports me and that's all that matters. I talked to my therapist about it and she said it's possible I was harsh but that maybe my dad needed to hear that since he has been coddled and enabled for five years.

I am fully prepared for my dad to not show up. If he doesn't it's his loss. Thanks again to everyone who gave me input, some of your comments were very eye opening. I may post an update in the future after the wedding but I haven't decided yet.

**TL;DR Broke down and went to therapy. Realized my dad is very passive aggressive and manipulative. My graduation day was horrible but a catalyst to realize things can't continue this way and I'm tired of being in the middle. Had a heart to heart with mom, realized my parents relationship is not a case of saint vs. sinner but two people who are human and made mistakes. Told mom she's invited but boyfriend is not and she will be asked to leave if she approaches my dad or any of his family. Talked to dad and told him he's hurting me with his behavior and it needs to stop. My dad is not speaking to me and there's a good chance he will boycott the wedding. Talked to brother and he supports me and says dad is being unfair. I'm just happy I get to marry Steve and that I don't have to be stuck in bullshit drama anymore.**

EDIT: wow this blew up! Thank you everyone who commented and offered a POV. Except for the people sending PM's of death threats. I've gotten at least half a dozen of those, plus calling me a whore (ironic since I'm a virgin) and hoping Steve cheats. You sound like lovely warm people full of happiness.

I wanted to point out some things that keep coming up:

1. Remember I come from a religion and culture that is very different from most people here. Divorce is shameful for us. It is humiliating. The only justifiable reason for divorce is an affair for our people. Divorce ""because you're not happy"" is not an excusable reason. An affair is the only way out. However, that being said, the person who commits the affair has just crippled themselves. Sex is very holy and pure in our religion and culture. It is to be between husband and wife only. That's it. And if you break up a marriage because of it you are forever blacklisted. While my mother could/should have gotten a divorce without having an affair, she STILL would have had a scarlet letter on her chest for getting divorced for ""no reason"" which is an ultimate act of selfishness. Marriage is very holy in our culture. To divorce for any reason other than an affair is ""to be like an unbelieving sinner"" which is, quite simply, not acceptable. I don't necessarily agree with this as I'm a little more liberal than the rest of my family and most people but it is what it is

2. My mother did NOT get off Scott free. She is no longer welcome in her church and none of her friends associate with her anymore. Her family, her friends, her church, her entire community has shunned her. She also lost her job because dipping your pen in company ink is expressly frowned upon at her former work place. Both she and her lover lost their jobs and had to find new ones

3. Many are saying I need to start including my moms partner in things and saying the fact she has been with him this whole time shows they have something special. It actually does not. I didn't put this in my post but my mom and I actually talked about her boyfriend for the first time. They are on the verge of breaking up and their relationship has been rocky for awhile. ""P""'s family and friends have disowned him too. He is not of our religion or culture (double bogus for my mom for taking a lover outside the faith) but no one wants anything to do with P. His ex wife has made their lives hell and will not let him see his kids. When he does see them they treat my mother terribly and make their hatred known. P is also sick of being not invited to every family event on our side and says Mom needs to start demanding he be invited to things. Mom is of the view point that they brought misery on themselves and need to accept the consequences of their actions and furthermore knows that if she insisted on bringing P she would burn the last of the bridges she has with us and will not do that. P is sick of her ""not putting him first"" and their relationship is falling apart because of it. The only reason they have lasted this long is because my mom and P only have each other because no one else wants them. And they both know it. My mom actually does love her boyfriend but he does not love her anymore and she knows they aren't going to make it

4. Many are saying (even explicitly hoping) Steve cheats on me so I understand my dads pain because I clearly don't since I haven't been cheated on (hey that's what my dad said!). This experience has actually taught me the opposite. If Steve were to cheat I would be out of my mind with pain and hurt. I wouldn't be able to function. I don't blame my dad for being unable to be around my mother. At first. If I had children with Steve, as much as it would SUCK, I would put on my big girl pants and do what needed to be done for my kids. I've gotten plenty of comments and PM's from people who WERE cheated on and heartbroken and devastated...and they did what needed to be done. Since I now know what it's like to have parents that pick their pain over their kids I know I would NEVER want to put my kids through that. It's just basic human decency.

5. I am not on any parents side. I don't love either of my parents more nor do I think either should be demonized and bashed or out on a pedestal and coddled.My parents are human and imperfect. They are both great people. And they both have done some really shitty things. That's it and that's all",1464810776.0,UPDATE: I [22F] am getting married soon.

So this morning, as I was leaving to go fishing with my buddy, Melissa said she wanted to talk.

She didn't beat around the bush, she got right to it. She said that she has been unhappy in our marriage for months and feels like it can only get worse from here. She then said that she felt like a divorce was on the horizon for us, and that it would be best for both of us. 

At this point I lose it. I tell her ""WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME FOR A DIVORCE BEFORE YOU STARTED FUCKING ANDREW?"" (sorry for the caps).

At this point she becomes a deer in the headlights. She stammers for a couple of seconds, then starts bawling her eyes out. She says she's sorry, that she didn't want to break my heart. Well, sorry bitch, you wanted a divorce, you're going to get one.

Literally minutes after she said she wanted a divorce, she contradicts herself by saying we should try to work things out, and that we should head to counselling.

I tell her that she has to have all her shit out of the house by Sunday afternoon (when I return). Or else I throw your shit onto the street. I've already secured my valuables, so she can't damage anything of mine.

So yeah that's about it. She thought she could just get away with cheating and request a divorce.

NOPE.

487,Dogornotdog,Updates,3o9qgb,2241,"I want to start of by thanking everyone so much for your comments, they helped me a lot. This is a messed up update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o3443/me_24_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_5_years_he_wants/) post


It's been the most intense day in my entire life and I feel drained and sick and every other messed up emotion. Please bear with me, this is probably going to be all over the place. 


So yesterday after reading all the comments (not to mention some other threads for other more general advice). You guys were right, I was looking at this issue as a single problem rather than the entire relationship as whole. Basically, this update isn't really about a dog at all, we had way bigger issues.


I left the house for a bit with the dogs and thought about what I wanted from this relationship. I figured that we could use some alone time with no distractions to talk so I left them with my aunt and went back home. I get back to my boyfriend - I'll call him Dan from here on out. He was playing a game with his headphones on. I asked if we could talk and the conversation went like this:


**Me:** Hey, I need to talk to you, can you come off the game next time you can save?


**Dan:** Why?


**Me:** We can talk properly after you've finished on the game.


He can sometimes be awhile depending on what he's doing in a game so I started cleaning up around the house while I waited. He comes over after about 30 minutes or so and just stares at me.


**Me:** I've been thinking about our relationship a lot lately and there's some things I'm not really happy with and so I was hoping we could sit down and talk through it?


**Dan:** Okay


**Me:** For awhile now I feel like i've been doing the majority of the housework, cleaning and taking care of the animals for awhile and it gets really tiring when most of my time is taken up by that but you still have loads of free time. I was thinking we could get up a chore schedule to give me a bit of a break?


**Dan:** But I'm happy with how things are.


**Me:** You're still happy even knowing how unhappy I am?


**Dan:** That's your problem to solve, not mine.


He just walked back into the living room and put his headset back on. I followed him in and asked why he was walking away but he ignored me and just went back to playing games. I went upstairs and called my brother, Sam.

I didn't really know who else to call. My dad worries too much and my mum means well but everything gets round the family quickly if you tell her anything. My brother though, he's the best. He's 4 years older than me but we were always close. Whatever pride and dignity I had left at that point were gone as soon as he answered. Just a mess of words and crying.


I wanted to tell him what happened so bad but I've never ever told anyone the bad parts of the relationship. Maybe because I knew what other people would say? I don't know. But when I was trying to tell Sam I just felt so beaten and at a loss. I stayed on the phone with my brother for a few minutes but I didn't even know where to start so I just told him that I was breaking up with Dan and I needed help to get some stuff out if he had the time. He said he'd be right over.


I calmed myself down and started getting some of my things together. Dan come upstairs to use the bathroom and saw me packing some clothes. He came into the room and asked if I was leaving. I said yes. To that, he said okay and went back downstairs.


After I'd got some clothes together, I went downstairs and started getting the animals things together. He saw me and told me that I was not taking the animals. I said that he doesn't look after them anyway so what does it matter to him if I take them? I went to move around him to pick some other stuff up but he pushed me into the wall and said ""stop being fucking stupid, you're not leaving and even if you did you can't have the animals"".


I just mumbled excuse me and went back to the bedroom and just sat. He came up after me a few minutes later and started apologising. I asked him to leave me alone and that I needed some space but he got in my face again and started shouting about being ungrateful and a bitch... and a lot of other names. He started getting physical again and pushed me down onto the bed. He kept yelling about how I should be happy and just take it. I was screaming and trying to get him off me but he's way stronger than me.


I am so so so lucky that Sam turned up when he did. He said that he could hear all the yelling and screaming from outside. He couldn't get down the front door so he had ran around to the back and broke the glass on the patio doors.He ran into the room and before I could even ask him to help, Dan was pinned on the floor and Sam was over him. My brother is not a violent person. He's pretty much a chilled out hippe without the long hair but he punched Dan really hard a few times and said that if he ever came near me again then he'd kill him. We called the police and he was taken away, he'll probably be let out soon but I'll be working on getting a restraining order asap. 


For now I'm staying with Sam and he's been... there's no words, the best brother in the world. He helped me back my stuff and he's okay with the animals staying with him too.


Sorry this is really long.. I don't really know what to do now. I'm really scared that Dan will turn up again but Sam has put some extra locks on the front door and on the spare room so I feel safer and I'll be the landlord tomorrow to explain in case he tries to destroy the house and blame it on me... so yeah, messed up. How the hell did I even get into this situation. But thank you again for your comments, even if it was a shit situation, I'm out of there now and hopefully I'll never see Dan again.

   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with boyfriend, got attacked, brother to the rescue. In shock and feel beaten.


**edit:** I woke up this morning and just cried. My brother came to check on me a few times and then brought some breakfast to me - yes, my brother is amazing and I will have to find him the best Christmas presents ever.


Luckily, or unluckily whichever way you view it, I bruise really easily and I can already sort of see some bruises coming up. Sam suggested going over to the hospital once they've come up and getting them documented just in case Dan denies it all.


I cannot thank you enough for all of your support, your advice has been so helpful and I will be following through on the charges and seeking legal help for my pets. You've helped keep me sane in this whole situation and even though I feel like shit, I'm so glad I'm out of there.

So I already wrote a short update in the comments of my previous post but I thought I would do a new post since it's probably easier to follow.

I knew that I had to tell Eric about what happened. He told me to come by his place after work to order in food and watch the taping of Survivor from Wednesday night (lol don't judge us!). I got there at around 6 and he asked if I wanted Chinese, pizza or Thai but I told him we needed to talk first before carrying on with our night.

I sat him down and explained to him that I loved meeting his family yesterday but I needed to tell him something. I explained that year, before I met him, I met his brother at a bar and we had a one night stand. I told him we never exchanged numbers, don't have each other on social media and never saw each other again until last night. I made sure to tell him that I didn't want to bring it up yesterday since it was his birthday and all, but he had a right to know and I understand if this is something that makes him uncomfortable. 

He looked pretty surprised and was kind of quiet for a few minutes. He then said I must have felt a little awkward yesterday but I definitely didn't show it, to which he thanked me for. I asked him what his thoughts were and he said ""well, I'm not going to lie and say that this isn't weird, but it's not exactly a deal breaker. I just need some time to think."" I told him that I would give him some space tonight and he agreed and thanked me for being honest.

I left and we didn't talk for the rest of the night. He did take it better than I thought he would but I for sure thought that this would end things between the two of us, especially with the silence. We both had the day off work today and he called me this morning shortly after I woke up and asked if he could come over. He showed up about half an hour later and told me that, after thinking about it all last night, he realizes that it was just a one time thing, the past is the past and he really likes where we're headed, so he would like to continue to pursue things, as long as I felt comfortable. Eric said he also talked to his brother last night and his brother definitely recognized me but again, said it was a one time thing and that we make a good couple and there's no lingering feelings of lust or anything. Eric then made a joke about his brother having good taste, which led to him pushing me onto the bed and having sex with me, haha (asserting dominance? marking his territory?)

All seems to be well now! I have the next four days off, which is rare for me as a flight attendant, so we're actually going on a spontaneous weekend trip :) 

Thanks for all of your advice guys! I appreciate it!

TLDR: I told Eric that I slept with his brother and he was ultimately cool with it. All seems well now!

Hey all :) Some of you helped me out a while back, so I'm here to give you a short update! 

The night started off pretty great with Jake being super cool and all. We went to dinner with some of our friends, got a shared ride, and all that fun stuff. We got to the dance and danced for a while, and he didn't do or say anything creepy. His friend, lets call him Paul since I have no idea who he is, showed up and said something in his ear, and Jake told me that there was a party and we were going. I said no, mostly because I am not comfortable with going to a stranger's party filled with people I don't know. Jake tried to convince me to go, and I kept saying no, until he was really upset. I told him I don't mind him going, and he got pretty mad. He said that I was boring and everyone fucks on prom night so I should too, which was pretty random since sex wasn't even on the table, and that I was making him look bad. He tried to pull my arm but a group of girls next to us told him he needs to leave, and he did. 

So overall, it was an okay night. It sucks I couldn't hang out with Jake all night, but I did meet some pretty cool girls who let me hang out with them the rest of the night! Overall, it was pretty fun, and I didn't die or get pigs blood dumped on me by John Travolta!

I just wanted to give an update. I forgot I had even posted on here with everything going on. 

I ended up going to my auntie's. She came and packed up my whole room with me and drove me to her house. It was really hard, because my mom was already talking about selling the house and moving to some other city, so she could start her life. 

I still have a lot of pain from what she did, but living with my Aunt and Uncle has been a great experience. Mr. B (my boss) got me a job at a Subway where my Aunt lives. I really like the people I work with. 

I started dating someone at my new school and we have been together for 5 months. Dan (17m) is great and we are in the same grade (he just turned 17), so we had the whole year together. School is ending in a few weeks and we have plans to go to the beach with my Aunt and Uncle for a week. 

I met some new friends and got involved with Volleyball and took part in drama. I also am Assistant Treasurer, because I was able to talk to the teacher in charge of the group and said I wanted experience. When she saw my transcripts, she said I could assist the girl who got the position. The girl (Joleen) is actually really cool and we became pretty good friends.

I still keep in touch with my friends from home, but I really feel like I have a great support system now. I haven't told anyone why I moved here just yet, minus my boyfriend, because its too embarrassing. And I don't like to talk about it. 

I was doing really good and had decided I didn't really want to see my mom again. Because who abandons their own kid? 

My mom came up last week and she has been waiting around to see me. I didn't know why until Saturday because my aunt finally told me, because my mom barged into the house and refused to leave. Auntie asked if I wanted to talk to ""her"" and I told her I would. 

My mom said she was so sorry for the way she treated me, that she wanted to know if I would move back for my senior year. She said we could pack up anytime I wanted. 

She then asked my aunt if she could stay in the guest room. 

My aunt said the room was mine. 

My mom said ""Lucy doesn't mind sharing."" 

My mom tried really hard to get me to chat with her alone, but Auntie stayed with me. It came out that my Mom wanted me to come home because her boyfriend left her and she blew through her money.

Auntie told Mom she needed to leave and then told me that my mom had been calling her about the check my birth father sends her. I guess she contacted the lawyer, said I was in her custody, and my mom signed the papers my aunt asked her to. Mom didn't realize it meant the check was coming to Auntie, who said she put most of it into a savings account for me. 

There were some things she needed money for and I am grateful she is paying for me and keeping me. It could have been so much worse. 

I guess the checks were pretty big. 

So I just told my mom not to contact me again. It hurt, a lot. The only reason she wanted me around was because of a check. 

That said, I guess my aunt has my father's number. She said he wants to talk with me when I am ready. So there is that.

I am not sure what to do now? It just hurts.

Original post.

So I'm back not sure if anyone remembers me but I took everyone's advice to heart.

So my wife was in our room still in bed crying I wasn't sure what to do but I had an idea. I went in to our room and, sat next to her and held her for a little bit and calmed her down.

After I asked her to get dressed because I wanted to take her somewhere special. (The restaurant I took her for our first date surprisingly I remembered after all this time)

She didn't know where we were going but once we got there she got all giddy and happy. We ate and, talked for a bit and listened to the music she seemed happy which is all I really want.

We went home and I told her I wanted to talk to her.(I wrote down what I wanted to say)
   
Here's what I said.

""Ever since I first met you I knew I wanted to be with you forever, I just couldn't find the words to express it.

Your my world there's nothing that could ever replace you out of the billions of women your special. Because your one of a kind, sure there's other women out there but in my eyes they don't compare.

Your my companion my partner my teammate, and I'll always be here to pick you up when your down.""

She cried a lot more and she she calmed down she wanted sex but it was different. It was slower and, calm we looked into each other's eyes until the end.

I reassured that I'm not going anywhere and that I married her and made a commitment to her. We cuddled the whole night after.

I talked to her more the next day about some therapy and she agreed as long as I go with her. (She doesn't want to do it alone) 

As for the whole ""children"" subject I'm going to wait a little bit until she's feeling better. Right now I don't think talking about kids would benefit her anyway.


We also talked about traveling in the future seeing some places and experience things together. Other than that she seems okay now I know she's not fully feeling better but she's happier a little.

Honestly having kids didn't really matter to me as long as I have her I'm happy. But there's the update not too long but that's what happened these past few days.

492,relationshipsthrow99,Relationships,4vqlov,2235,"I've been with my fiance for 3 years, 8 months engaged. We've had our ups and downs, but for the most part things have been pretty great, until she moved in 6 months ago. We've been combining our lifestyles and finances, basically easing into merging our lives together.

The problem is she's a ""people pleaser"", in her own words. She's been in therapy for 6 years, and I guess I never knew how bad it was until moving in with her, a lot of which she's hidden from me. I don't want this to get too long, so here's some of the highlights in no particular order:

* She recently was promoted into accounts payable at her company and realized she is the lowest paid person on payroll. She didn't negotiate a good starting wage, and has never asked for a raise, or had one, despite multiple promotions.

* She inherited a car a few months ago and sold it. She had offers online from $18k-$25k, but sold it to the first person who showed up for $10k.

* She caught someone stealing her bike at college. The woman stealing the bike managed to convince my fiance that it was actually her bike and my fiance just let her take it, despite the fact that she caught the woman cutting her bike lock.

* Last spring was my 30th birthday and she ordered a giant chocolate cake for the party. The cake normally comes with nuts, but given my allergy for nuts she ordered it without them. Well when she went to pick it up and it had nuts on it, she just paid for it and brought it home. I couldn't even be in the same room as the cake.

Which brings us to tomorrow. My father recently passed away and I need to fly to the other end of the country to get things sorted out with family, attend the funeral, etc.. Meanwhile, we recently had a pipe burst in our home, and the contractors will be out tomorrow to fix it. My flight's at 6am and my fiance will have to handle it, including all the negotiations because we don't know the extent of the damages.

I've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners? I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.

We've talked about it a few times before, but it's been unproductive. She's convinced she's just being nice and doesn't like confrontation, then brings up examples of extremely confrontational people. I think she puts her aversion to conflict above her/our long term goals, and she needs to find a happy medium. She doesn't understand how negatively this is impacting her life.

But at the same time, we've had some amazing years together and she really is a great person. We're compatible in almost every other way. So is this over like I think it is? Is there any way I can get through to her? Should I tell her I'm thinking about leaving?

tl;dr: Fiance is a self-described ""people pleaser"", it's caused her to make a lot of terrible mistakes and I'm thinking about leaving her.",1470110023.0,"My fiance [27f] is a ""people pleaser"". It's causing problems and I'm [30m] thinking about calling off the wedding.",0.96
493,Housesitterisapsycho,Non-Romantic,4f1fqv,2238,"A week ago my husband Rory and I returned home from a two week vacation. We had hired a house sitter (Clara) to come over every day and feed our cats, check the mail, and also water my plants every three days. 

&nbsp;

When we entered our house I instinctively turned to drop my keys into the key bowl and they hit the ground. We turned on our lights and our foyer had been completely rearranged. Our first thought was we had been robbed and we began to move through the house checking every room to make sure we were home alone, ready to dial 911. 

&nbsp;

What we discovered was just bizarre. All of our furniture had been rearranged, our living room, dining room, tv and stereo system, office, bedroom, my craft room, the den, my husband's game room. Even my piano has been moved!!

&nbsp;

Back in the kitchen we were looking around and I noticed that my pantry door was open. When I went to close it I realized my entire walk in pantry had been completely rearranged floor to ceiling. I started opening cabinets and all my baking supplies, pots and pans, cutlery, and even my silverware and junk drawers have been moved.

&nbsp;

As I was frantically looking through the bedroom and office making sure nothing had been stolen and our safe was intact, Rory found a note from Clara. In it she stated that she'd enjoyed house sitting for us and she hoped that we liked our new living space. That she has been taking a course in interior design and she decided to ""allow us to become her first client, pro bono"" (her words!). She placed pieces from other rooms in different rooms so it wasn't as easy as just switching each room back to how it was. She took down pictures and artwork, *patched the holes in the walls*, and hung my artwork in different rooms!

&nbsp;

Reddit.....we do NOT like our new living space. What she did completely messed up the flow of our home. Rory and I spent over six months rearranging furniture and trying pieces in different rooms until we found exactly what we liked best. It was our first home together and it was important that we design it together as well. It really made us feel like our home was truly ours. 

&nbsp;

I really did not know what to say to her so I haven't talked to her yet. Clara is my friend and so Rory is leaving it up to me to deal with this. We spent three days putting our home back together again and I don't know how to deal with this. She has emailed me and asked what I think about the house and asked if I'd write a review for her new interior design business!! The level of entitlement was just mind boggling and then for her to expect a pat on the back and a review as well?

&nbsp;

I do not know how to address this with her because honestly I'm afraid that if I don't have a script in mind, I will just begin screaming at her. I feel incredibly violated, almost as if someone had broken into the house. Both Rory and I are OCD, and I have GAD. I'm having difficulty sleeping at night and I am so uncomfortable in the house ever since we got home. How do I explain that this was unappreciated and highly violating? Should I even mention that it was a really, really shitty design job? 

&nbsp;


She is a SAHM and she is often bored and then ""opens a business"" and six months later drops it and never does it again. She's been a photographer, a caterer, a cake decorator, and now I guess an interior designer. Always unlicensed and she always leaves someone in a lurch. She was supposed to cater a wedding. She got bored, quit doing it, and didn't tell the bride until a month before the wedding. Same with doing baby photo shoots and a few people's cakes for birthdays or baby showers. 

&nbsp;

She seems to enjoy the thrill of new business cards, buying all the equipment, making a Facebook business page, and then once she starts getting jobs (because unfortunately she's one of those people that are great at everything they pick up) she gets bored and quits. 

&nbsp;

Please tell me what to say and how to address this!!

&nbsp;

**TL;DR After going on vacation for two weeks, my husband and I returned home only to find all of our furniture moved around. How do we address this?**




**UPDATE**

&nbsp;

First of all thank you to everyone who replied. I've read every single comment on the thread, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Thanks to everyone that decided to private message me and tell me I was crazy and a whining *insert curse word here*. 

&nbsp;

A little clarification, Clara does know about our medical issues. The first few times I went to knitting group I had mild panic attacks and it was quite obvious I had issues with my yarn tension due to my anxiety. Our entire knitting group really rallied around me and appointed themselves my surrogate ""grandmas and sisters"". This is one of the big reasons that I didn't think twice about having her housesit, as she knew about them.

&nbsp;

I showed Rory the thread and he agreed with me that we did need to address it soon so I wrote an email to Clara based on the comments of /u/tingiling and /u/illinoiscentralst.

&nbsp;

>Dear Clara,


>I'm so very hurt and angry about what you have done. We let you into our home because we trusted you. We trusted you to respect how we put our hearts into making it our home. We trusted you to respect how important it is to us to have our own space where we can feel safe and comfortable. Mainly, we trusted you to respect our home and what it meant to us in the short time you would spend in it alone.


>When we came home, we thought we had been robbed and panicked! When we realised that nothing was stolen, but that our entire home had been rearranged to fit someone else's idea of a house without our permission or knowledge, we didn't feel much better. You are aware of mine and Rory's medical conditions and what it means to us to have a safe space.


>I'm hurt by your actions. But, I also think people can make mistakes. I was wondering if we can meet up for a quick coffee/lunch to discuss what has happened here when you housesat for us. 


>Amy

&nbsp;

We're set to meet up for coffee on Tuesday afternoon at the local coffee shop. All she replied back with was ""I'm so sorry and I would like to explain."" I have what I want to say charted it out and I've practiced it with Rory until I'm blue in the face. I'm not sure what she could explain to me but I'm interested to hear what it could be. I called a few women from the knitting group and I asked them if they'd heard that Clara had done anything to my house. They had not. I asked them to tea on Thursday to speak with them. So that is also set up.

&nbsp;

If anyone has any new questions I'll try to answer them here. Thanks for all your advice, I'll try to update when I have something new.

Hi reddit. I'm here with a very sad update.

When I wrote my original post, I was about 18 weeks pregnant with Ethan. In the middle of December, at 26 weeks, Ethan decided to come early. Unfortunately he did not make it. He was the most beautiful little boy. The two days my husband and I got to spend with him were the best of our lives. I have a picture of him on my desk and I'm looking at it right now as I write this. I miss him every day.

Chris and I were in a state of absolute shock and heartache. I don't remember much about the period immediately following losing our son, but I do remember just feeling absolutely crushed with guilt and sadness. I blamed myself for his death and I still do, although time and counseling have helped a bit. Most of the time I feel like I'm in a dream and soon enough I'll wake up and my belly will be big again and I'll feel Ethan kicking...Chris and I are leaning on each other as best we can, but obviously it's put a strain on our marriage. Any advice from anyone who's experienced the loss of a child would be greatly appreciated. I love my husband dearly and I have no idea how to support him while dealing with my own grief. We are seeing a counselor both together and separately, once a week.

Now I guess I should discuss my father's response to losing Ethan. After he passed, we obviously let our immediate family members (parents and siblings) know what had happened. We asked them to keep it to themselves and that we (Chris and I) would make the announcement when we were ready. As you may expect, my father didn't respect our wishes. Less than an HOUR after we told them Ethan was gone, he sent out a mass text to his side of the family letting them know that ""Jake Jr."" had gone to heaven and asking people to keep Chris and me in their prayers (for the record, Chris and I are not religious and my family has a history of not respecting that). Soon after that my phone was bombarded with calls and texts from people I had never even met expressing condolences that ""Jake"" had gone home to Jesus. Maybe I'm ungrateful, but I was livid. I had just lost my son and my husband and I had *expressly* told our families of our desire to keep it private until we could announce it the way we wanted to. And to add insult to injury, my father couldn't even acknowledge Ethan's name even in death.

I called my father and EXPLODED. I took out all my grief on him, and goddamn it felt good. Long story short, I am no-contact with both of my parents (my mom defended my dad's actions), and I have no plans to allow them in my life ever again. I feel much better for it.

So...here we are a month later. Things have gotten a little bit better since much of the rawness has eased a little bit but I won't lie, the pain is always there. If anyone has any coping mechanisms, or advice on how to keep my marriage strong, I would really appreciate it. Also if this post was a bit jumbled or I sound like I'm ""distant"" then I am sorry. I'm in a perpetual state of numbness, like i'm in a dream. My therapist has told me that I often describe what happened like it happened to a friend of mine, not to me. She says that's my mind's way of protecting myself from the depth of my grief, and I'm sure she's right. Anyway, I just wanted to throw that out. Thank you for reading guys.

**tl,dr: Our son was born prematurely and lived for two days. My dad was disrespectful following his death and I'm NC with my parents. Husband and I are coping as best we can, would appreciate any advice.**

**Edit: I went to bed shortly after I wrote this and woke up to an outpouring of support and kind words. Thank you to everyone who sent me PMs or who left words of encouragement, Chris and I truly, truly appreciate them. I will try to respond to each and every one of you but it may take some time.

While I was taming a shower, he looked through all of the photos on my laptop and yelled at me cause I still had photos of me and my ex. I didn?t even remember, cause I don?t look at those photos and I guess I was too lazy to delete them. Also, I don?t use that laptop so often since it?s slow, soooo yeah, I wasn?t being sentimental.

I?ve always been a nosy person and I admit I stalked his wall, his exes, even his parents, BUT it was all public info. I?ve been alone with his laptop/phone etc. but I?ve never ever even thought about reading his private conversations. I wouldn?t do that to anyone. He doesn?t care, though. He memorized my ipad password and he read everything, including some really private posts here on reddit. He yelled at me and broke up with me. 

He occasionally lurks in my facebook account, because I?m dumb and I?m always like ?No, he wouldn?t do that again? but he always does. Today I was logged on our shared laptop and I saw in my fb app that there was some activity going on 40 minutes ago while I was taking a shower. I looked the chrome history, but he had deleted everything. I lost it and I started crying and he had the audacity to blame me for his trust issues and said that there is something I?m hiding since I?m reacting this way. I tried to explain I have nothing to hide, but it?s just horrible to feel uncomfortable at home. I can?t even sleep properly anymore because I?m nervous if he?ll decide to randomly read my messages. He scrolled maybe months of my fb searches which is really embarrassing and yelled at me again. He said I must be hiding something since I?m so upset. I don?t hide anything and I never gave him a reason not too trust me. Once he dumped me and I grabbed a beer with an old friend and he found out, blamed me for cheating on him and even complained to my mother. I go to therapy every week (not only because of him, I have other issues). There was this group session and I met a boy who has similar problems to mine and I felt that finally I?d have someone outside therapy to talk to. He?s not my type and I didn?t like him in a romantic way, I just felt we could be friends but my boyfriend found out we?ve talked once (because he was snooping again ofc) and again yelled at me. He said I was a cheater and that?s why he had trust issues. I?ve always been faithful and I didn?t deserve this. 

I changed all my passwords but I?m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. He went out and told me I deserve this and he?s right to invade my privacy and I have no right to be mad. I don?t know what to do anymore.

As stated before, her actions are relatively recent. She hasn't been a bad friend since I met her. She's one of those ""SuperWhoLock"" theatre push-over tumblr gals (her words, not mine). So this took me by surprise. 

I decided to sit her down in a public place and speak with her about the issue. I told her that I don't have a lot of money and I won't flip the bill on trips she invites me too. 

Of course, she got angry. She stated that I shouldn't *use* her and I was a bad friend. 

I ended up giggling in reply, as I do this when I'm nervous. This infuriated her. 

She went on a long winded monologue about how she knows my *type* and how since she's from Long Island I think she has money. Blah blah blah. 

When she finally stopped, I informed her that that was not the case. I explained that I don't care about her parent's money, but our friendship. After further discussion, she started to tear up. 

Turns out that though Mommy and Daddy bought her the car AND was providing her with gas money (an allowance, per se), she was saving up for something she wanted. This *something* was a five thousand dollar trip to have her online boyfriend fly up this summer and to put him in a ritzy hotel. Her parents didn't approve of her relationship, so they would not fund it. 

Apparently, she has been hustling people out of their money in order to fund the trip, while continuing her luxury lifestyle. 

I believe she expected me to feel some sort of sympathy for her. She was teary eyed and sniffling about *true love* and how she is doing this to meet the *one*. But I couldn't take it. 

I ended up explaining to her that she cannot use people as human ATMs. And that even though she is a nice girl, I don't appreciate her doing ugly things. 

She babbled on about how I wouldn't understand because *love* or some shit. 

I sighed and ended my friendship with her on the spot. I've spent a lot of time with this girl and collected several good memories, but someone who refuses to see their own wrong doings is not for me. 

TL;DR: Confront friend about using me. She denies it, saying I'm using her. She reveals why she was using me (and others). I end the friendship when she refuses to see the error of her ways. 

EDIT: Wouldn't really classify her as a ""Tumblrina"". She likes tumblr culture, but she isn't as radical/insane as the ones I've seen online.

Yesterday's update

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dd1kd/update_me_42m_with_my_wife_32f_3_years_shes/


Today's conclusion.

I read all of the comments and I must say, you had me convinced that she was cheating. I know most suggested spending money on lawyers/gps/private investigators and stuff but I needed to know for myself so I stuck with the original plan.

As she was getting into the car I came out and said ""hang on, I'm coming too. I've been thinking about losing weight and you don't want to be married to a fat fuck like me.""

She laughed and said ""don't be daft, you're not fat! But it will be brill if you join too, then we can do the sauna '  stuff.""

So we set off in completely a different direction of the gym. I asked her about the local gym and she laughed again and said ""How much money do you think we have!"" apparently the gym near us is really expensive.

Then the best bit: she then pulls over and out of this house comes the guy ('Steve') built like a boxer and climbs into the car and another, slightly smaller. As soon as they get in all my worries disappear. This was Steve pronounced 'Thteven'; as camp as they come and then proceeded to flirt WITH ME! The other guy was his boyfriend.

When we got home later I asked her about him on Facebook and she said ""if I said I'd emptied the bin he'd like it!""

Then I showed her the Reddit posts and she laughed and said why didn't you just ask me who he was. And then she laughed again when she read I went to the wrong gym.

She said some unflattering things about one or two messages but I don't care. All is well.
---   
**tl;dr**: Wrong gym, gay dude.

Edit: I'm a little overwhelmed by the massive response this got. I thought there were just a few people following the story. My gut feeling was that there was nothing wrong because everything else just seemed so normal like I said in the first posts. I feel a bit bad (and a bit daft) about checking up and misleading her but she just found it funny.

I had been with Carrie for 10 years, best friends since we met at the age of 12 in high school. We had tons of amazing memories, we've traveled to several countries together and made long term work for 3 years while separated due to studies. (Though now I'm having trouble believing anything was real).



Last Thursday I proposed to her in St Lucia, (Not in front of anyone mind you, I wanted it to just be private). She didn't say anything and I was thinking, oh shit, did I say or do something wrong? She started crying and said she had something to explain to me. She didn't want to marry me because she'd been sleeping with the co worker she said was 'just a friend' for around 3 months. 



She said she rationalized it was just a thing that would pass but it's continued and she said she loves me so much, more than I'll ever understand, that I've helped her so much and she doesn't even know why she has done this. She said she loved me too much to marry me knowing she'd done what she did.


She doesn't love the guy, it was just sex and she had been trying to stop the affair but I proposed before that happened and she said she knew when I was kneeling that she couldn't marry me, not after everything I'd done for her, so she told me.


I feel like my whole world has shattered. We had an awkward flight home on Friday evening and haven't spoken since. She has tried calling me but I haven't answered and I have until Monday off, so I'm just here.


I've barely eaten, I feel like there's a black hole in my stomach draining everything I have mentally. I can't wrap my head around the fact that she was cheating, that she lied, that she hid it from me.


My sister apparently had some words for her. I'm trying to pretend I'm okay but I'm not. Every morning that I've woken up since last week Friday morning has just been bleak.


I love her so much but I've no intentions of getting back together, I don't think I would ever be able to trust her again much less forgive her for a very long time. My best friend brought a six pack yesterday and we drank in the evening, I cried my eyes out in the shower last night. I never cry, not even when my mom who I was extremely close to passed away, but I was sobbing like a child last night and honestly I would have loved if my mom had been there to tell me it'd be okay.


My sister brought over some breakfast this morning and basically made me eat because she knows I haven't really been eating lately, zero appetite.


Anyway, I'm sorry this post is so incoherent. Any tips for someone on how best to move forward and where to go from here? Because I've got nothing, no ideas, no clue. I feel like a zombie.

I wanted to thank everybody for the kind words in my first post.  Honestly it meant the world to me.  Trying to balance new feelings against the guilt of feeling like I'm betraying my wife is still a struggle but I am getting better at it.

The reason for this update is to let you know how Saturday's date went.  If I wasn't at the center of this I would probably find this funny but as it stands I am embarrassed (but I will admit looking back I still find it funny).

Stacey came over about mid day Saturday and we were going to watch a movie that both of us wanted to see that was on Netflix.  One of the posters in my first thread suggested that when I was sitting next to her on the couch that I should put my arm around her.  I thought this was a good idea and a way to just see where things go.

First of all a giant thank you to the person who wrote that, can't remember the name right now, it was perfect.  As we were sitting on the couch she sat down right next to me.  I slipped my arm around her and she immediately laid her head on my shoulder.  We watched a little of the movie then she started to hold my hand.  I looked down at her and we started kissing.  Well one kiss led to another and things escalated from there.  Just before the big event was about to occur she asks me if I have any protection.  D'oh!!!!

I then tell her I don't and this is when things went from playful to dead serious in a matter of seconds.  She ask's me what have I been using for protection.  I then explain that I haven't been using anything because this was the very first time I had been with someone in almost 4 1/2 years.  I guess she had no idea.  This then led to a me explaining she is the first girl I have even dated.  For whatever reason this made her tear up a little which freaked me out.  Believe me the last thing I wanted was to upset her and mind you I am sitting on my couch in only my underwear and very excited.  I start to apologize and tell her I'm sorry for upsetting her.  She tells me not to be silly and that she just got overcame with emotion because it made her feel very special and we hugged.  She of course is in her underwear as well so the hugging did not help my excitement any.  

She of course is finding this funny.  We both get dressed to go to the store as I then had to confess I've never worn a condom in my life.  My wife and I were just very very very lucky when we were kids.  I used to just pull out early which after I got older I realized how dumb that was.

Anyway we go and she picks out a box and we head back home.  She kisses me as I am coming through the door and we start all over again.  She has figured out that there is a place on my neck that she can kiss that makes my hair stand on end on my arms and obviously make another part of me very excited.  We hit the couch again and this time the underwear comes off and I am ripping into the condom box and tear open the package and put the damn thing on and just as I'm about to enter her my door bell rings and we both realize that it is now 7 and my BIL & SIL are there to meet us to go out for dinner.  Yes this was pre planned and yes we both totally forgot.  

I am about to scream out of frustration at this point but we both quickly put on our clothes and she is sitting on the couch laughing hysterically.  I go answer the door and they come in.  My BIL starts talking and my SIL sits down on a chair next to Stacey and they start talking, now mind you she is still giggling.  My BIL God love him is a great guy but totally oblivious to things sometimes (even when he was a kid he was like this) and he just talked the entire time to both of us.  I sat down next to Stacey and held her hand.  Then there came the moment I realize that there is a torn open box of condoms on the floor and an open condom wrapper on the footstool.  Before I could cover it up with a magazine my SIL notices it and the look of (I'm not sure what, horror maybe) on her face was something to see.  She then makes eye contact with me and we both turn three shades of red.  All the while my BIL is going on and on about something.  Stacey is again laughing hysterically.  We pile into their car and go off to dinner.  Stacey is taking great delight in tormenting me.  Every now and then she leans over and kisses my neck and start whispering things in my ear and honestly I'm about to lose it (hey its been a long long time).

We get to the restaurant and I have to go pee so I leave to go the bathroom only to find out that I am still wearing my condom.  The guy at the urinal next to me was traumatized for life.

Anyway I don't think I was great dinner company as all I could think about was seeing Stacey without her clothes on.  I tried to pretend to care about conversation but not really sure I succeeded.  We then went and saw the new vacation movie and then they took us home.

After they leave Stacey tells me that she is tired and is leaving to.  I am sure I looked like a beat puppy dog at this point and she starts laughing again telling me she is teasing me.  She walks over grabs the box off of the floor and takes my hand and leads me upstairs.

Without going into great detail let's just say I am glad I bought a box and not just one.  I woke up the next morning holding her in my arms and honestly nothing has felt this right in years.

We spent all day together on Sunday as well.  I just came out and asked her what she liked doing and much to my surprise she listed off several outdoor things, who knew?

I am really starting to have very strong feelings for Stacey.  Honestly when we are apart now things don't seem right to me.

So it's been about a week. I told her everything. I told her how much it was eating me up inside to tell her this. It could not have possibly gone any better. She feels the same way I did. Our friendship seems to have gotten so much stronger and no matter what I told her, she told me our friendship was solid. I thanked her for always being there for me when I was going through rough times as I did the same for her. She told me age does not matter to her at all, she is 20 as I just flat out asked her cause I really needed to know. No boyfriend. She told me she's always felt some kind of strong connection between us, a ""weird, but good weird connection"" her words. I asked her if it was possible she had a stronger than friendship feel towards me and she said yes and I couldn't be happier. At the same time, we decided to see where this goes and whether it becomes something we both want to pursue so time will only tell. I thank everyone for their kind advice. Thank you fellow redditors.

I know not many people saw my other post but I wanted to update anyways. She took all of my food out of the kitchen and put it in my mini fridge which she unplugged and left shut in my bedroom so the whole fridge became a disgusting mouldy mess. She did that because she said she didn't want me in common areas of the apartment anymore if I couldn't dress appropriately (and I was just wearing normal shorts!) yet somehow she thinks it's perfectly fine to do coke with her friends off our kitchen island. She also wrecked my lululemon leggings with her nail file because they're apparently too provocative to be worn anywhere outside of the bedroom. She's insane. Her boyfriend broke up with her after that incident and I think it was for the best, he could do so much better. She went extra crazy after that and kept texting me that she knows I'm sleeping with him and that I asked him to break up with her.  


So I moved out. I really didn't want to because I loved my apartment but I didn't want to put up with her anymore and I found an even better apartment with friends I can actually live with. 


Thanks for the advice with my first question, to be honest I was a bit surprised so many of the comments were blaming me but nothing I did made her happy anyways so whatever.

First off, let me thank all you guys for all your wishes and blessing and valuable advice. I may not have responded to each and every reply, yet I can assure that I read every single one, so thanks.

The biggest thing I took away from /r/relationships was that I need to balance her medical needs and her emotional needs. You guys were right. I was being more of a house-nurse than a husband. So, I needed to do something to fix that.

You people were right. She made the offer for me to sleep with other women because she was afraid that she?s not enough. So, when she talked about it again, I resorted to an old trick of mine. I act childish. You know when little kids don?t want to eat broccoli or asparagus and they just cross their hands and act petulant, well I, a 25 year old man, do that. And yes, it works. Why ? Because its a unique combination of persistence and comic effect. But in all seriousness, I first went to her and held her hand and told her a very sincere ?I love you? and that she?s the only one for me. She insisted once more and I switched to baby mode. I crossed my hands and put on a baby voice and I told her that I will not talk to her until she stops talking about this. She said with an incredulous chuckle, ?Are you serious right now??. I looked away from her, and let out a childish *hmph*. I stayed there like that for 2 hours. She went from talking seriously, to angry screaming, to laughing her ass of, to silence, until she finally said, ?Sorry. I won?t bring it up again?. I smiled, kissed her, then ran off to the bathroom (those 2 hours were torture). This issue was resolved. But there were more problems.

Many of you may not agree with me here, before I even thought of doing anything on the physical front, I had to check with her doctors. So I talked to the doctor who first took over her case. This guy is seriously the best doctor I have ever known. Even though he behaves professionally, he is so open and friendly that I felt no problem in talking about sex. I told him plain and simple that my wife was craving intimacy and that its affecting our marriage and her emotional health. He gave me an understanding smile and then said plain and clearly what he wanted to. He reminded me that he had told me when she was in the ICU after the accident that our marriage will go through a very tough phase. And that it will test every bit of our self control but we have to, if she is to make a full recovery.

Then again he told me that he agreed that something needed to be done. He said that oral sex on either side is completely, completely forbidden. If I stimulate her, her pelvis might thrust. If she stimulates me, her neck will move excessively and as as result that might put pressure on her spine. 7 months is not enough, especially not with the damage dealt to the bones in her case. What he did say is that if she is lying down, she could probably use her hands a little. But the pivot should be her elbow and not her shoulder. So, that certainly opened up some possibilities for us. Other than that, the doctor warned me very seriously that we should not try anything stupid. She?ll have to live with the consequences forever.

So with this in mind, I headed home. She was reading a book, and I told her that I had talked to the doctors, and this is what they told me. She was beyond ecstatic. So, I immediately took her shirt off, got her off her bed and helped her to our excessively large futon. It has float cushions so it didn?t affect her posture. I lay down on my back, and she lay down on top of me with her back on my stomach. Using a few pillows we were able to fix her head pointing towards me. A small pillow below her hips and she was comfortable. This is the position that we were able to find that worked for us. Now we just lay like this and make out for hours on end as soon as I get home, and she is able to use her hands on me. This way there is no strain on her back nor her shoulders. We switch up left/right position to make sure her neck doesn?t stay bent one way for too long. Ever sine we started this, she has been extra cheerful and happy. We got back to the routine where we would have this sexting/dirty talk build up till I came home from work and though we don?t have sex right now, it still helps us to feel like we?re heading back to normalcy.

A couple of times, while we were getting really into it, I started sucking on her breasts and started touching them. Now she has come from such stimulation before so I had to be careful as it might cause some sudden movement. So because I didn?t want her to come, I had to go slowly and she felt like it was torture and she ended up feeling more frustrated because I had to let go just as she reached the brink. So, we stopped that for now.

This is again a short term solution and I know that very soon she?ll want more, but I?m taking small steps at this point, in what I hope is the right direction. You people were right that I was trying to contain her. But please do understand the spirit that was done in. She?s my wife and I don?t want to see her hurt. I want to see her walk and jump again. I don?t want to see her in pain and I want all this to get over so that we can be back to normal. She keeps asking for more but instead of flat out saying No, I plead with her to wait for a little while. I ask it as a personal favour and she reluctantly obliges, which I?m thankful for. She?s getting better everyday and I feel like we?re at a better place in our relationship now.

To those of you who are in such a situation, here?s some advice : These are trying times. They?ll push and pull your bond to the limits and you will feel helpless at times, and you might want to shut yourself away from it all. The tunnel might seem too long and you might not see the light yet, but just believing that there is light at the end of it all helps a lot. You need to keep that special thing about your relationship alive. How we do it, you ask ? Every night, we read our marriage vows to each other. A month ago she had been in terrible pain and the doctors had done their work and left. I felt like shit because I couldn?t help her. The next day, for some reason she was extremely cranky and rude and I was frustrated. I went out of the room and slammed the door shut. I heard her crying inside and I felt terrible. I just wanted to run away from it all. Then my eye fell on the plaque that we got engraved with our vows. I picked it up and read them again and again. I realised why I had to stick through it all, why I had to wait for these 2 years, why I had to be stronger. It was simply because I loved her more than I loved myself.

*In sickness and in health?*

She was asleep when I entered the room that evening. I sat next to her and started reading our vows out loud. When I looked up, she was smiling at me with tears in her eyes.

I have to postpone that because my mother passed away last month, my father passed away to blood cancer a few years back, and my mother to an aneurysm a month ago.

This happened the same month but I haven't been in the best mindset to deal with it so I've put it off until now. 

My mother passed away on the 6th last month. She lives in the UK so I went to be with my family and support them and myself for a while. My girlfriend didn't come along as it was a last minute flight and she had just flown out to Vancouver for business.

I was with my family, essentially just my 2 brothers and some cousins, for 2 weeks, I came back to get some belongings so I can relocate there for a month or so. My girlfriend knew I was coming back and was going to come with me.

I came back on the 21st but was supposed to come back a day after. I took a taxi home as my girlfriend was still, according to her, in Vancouver. There wasn't any car in my driveway or shoes on my porch, I wasn't expecting anyone to be home anyways. I came home around 1am and walked straight into our bedroom and she was sleeping there with some other guy. 

I didn't wake her up or anything and I've been at a hotel every since. She's been calling me for weeks but I can't answer. I really don't know what to do, my family wasn't very close but my parents meant everything to me. Seeing my girlfriend there made me realize I don't have anyone right now..

I'm not sure if you can see it or not, but the tl;dr was I suspected my husband of having an affair with our mutual friend (Jade, who is married to Fred, who was a friend of my husband's), but I had no physical evidence.

So yesterday I tracked my husband with gps and watched where he was going during the day. When I saw that he was in a car (travelling fast down a road to out of town), I casually texted him and asked what he was up to. He said he was walking to the store, which was in the opposite direction of where he was headed. I watched him all day. Stopping here and there, going out to eat with her, travelling all over the place. I would periodically text him to make conversation, and he would lie the entire time. At one point he said he was just walking around the neighborhood thinking about ""us."" My blood was boiling. I knew he was with someone who had an iPhone because there were no calls or texts made that morning, so he must have communicated via iMessage. Jade has an iPhone. I highly suspected he was with her, but I had no proof. After he was dropped off at home he texted me saying he was sorry for being distant today, he was just doing a lot of thinking. I didn't tell him I knew he was lying the whole day because I had planned to gather more evidence.

Later in the evening I couldn't take it any more. I asked him where he was all day, and he said ""What do you mean, I told you I was walking around."" In my rage I said ""I know you are lying. I know where you've been."" He admitted to spending a little time with Jade, that they went and grabbed something to eat. I told him I knew about everywhere he went. I knew about the late night phone calls (while I was watching him yesterday I checked the phone records and saw an unbelievable amount of calls going back and forth between them. I don't know why I didn't think to check the call records on Monday). I knew about the secret private messages on social media. I knew about it all. He confessed that he and Jade have gotten really close and spend a lot of time together, talking. At first he said it was innocent. I told him if it was innocent, he wouldn't be lying and sneaking around. He agreed and admitted he knew what he was doing was wrong.

I texted Fred last night and told him everything I knew. He said he had been uncomfortable with their friendship for a while, but didn't know if I was or if I even knew. We talked for a while, but I don't know what they are going to do. All I know is I am getting a divorce. My husband claims their relationship was never physical but I can never trust him again. No matter what he does or where he goes, I will always question who he is with and if he's lying to me. I cannot and will not spend my life tracking my husband and making sure he is where he says he is, and isn't sneaking around with other women.

I deleted and blocked Jade off of all my social media accounts. I didn't text her or say anything to her. I know if I even tried I would end up saying some pretty foul stuff to her, which she deserves, but I'm better than that. So not only did I lose an extremely shitty friend in this whole thing, I am also losing my best friend, the love of my life, and the father of my children. I am destroyed.

Since she told me she didn't want me many years ago, it's not like I've been lusting after her, but the feelings were still there. I know that everyone told me that it was a bad idea, but I had to try. I took everyone's advice and made sure that I didn't pay for anything that was extravagant or over the top.

Anyway, last week we went on two dates. We did the whole dinner and a movie thing and we also went to the museum. Earlier this week we went to a play, which sucked, got some food after which we had sex - which has been a long time coming. All was good. Great, actually.

Yesterday I went over to her house to bring her lunch. I knew she was home. I picked up some Chinese food and drove to her apartment. I have the spare key to her place, so I opened the door and went in, and see her fucking some guy on the couch. We made eye contact, then I just walked out. She called me like an hour later and told me that we weren't exclusive and that if I didn't want her to be with other guys, that's fine, but I needed to tell her in advance. I told her to get fucked.

* Husband - Tod ( this is shorter than husband, I'm lazy.)

So,  the day I posted after we went over the texts which started after we missed their call and went up until we sent the email... all just... spiteful shit about how we waste our money, time, and life volunteering and don't spend enough time with their children/cousins/cousins children/family anymore. It started out telling Tod he was being a 'candy ass bitch who is whipped' by his 'cold harpy child hatin wife'. And just degraded from there. Tod only sent back a few saying he'd email him about it and asking him to not talk about me.

So we sent the email here is basically what we sent I semi edited it. Tod send it as if it was just from him, we almost added in his parents but decided we'd just forward it to them if it really got out of hand, NP Timmy did it for him!

> Tim, I'm sending you an email so we can talk about what happened on Thanksgiving. I think this would be better for us both since when we are heated we say things rashly. You didn't give me much time to really think about it so here it goes.

> I don't understand why you volunteered us to buy gifts. We are happy to buy gifts for your children as we have every year. Is there something going on? Is someone having financial problems? While we would gladly help anyone who asked (As we have before, you should recall Cathy and Kiki 2 years ago. you helped too!) being set up in front of young children was rude. Not to mention you telling us we aren't allowed at Christmas now. 

> The texts and angry voicemails were also uncalled for.

> Please take some time and get back to me. I hope we can work this out as our family is very important to us. Tod


Yes well that went over about as well as water on a grease fire.

For one Timmy forwarded the email to Rhonda and Keith, Kira, and Ben. That was rude but we were going to do the same thing either way. Ben sent us a email letting us know what Timmy did and said he was sorry he wasn't there to jump in but would try and talk to Timmy. Timmy and Ben are actually really close so it was nice to see he thought Timmy was being unreasonable as well since they are normally very close/like minded. 

I'm not going to put his email here I'm just going to highlight what he said and then tell you what Keith and Rhonda said in their email/visit.

* I am a cold, child hating, harpy, and I sleep around.
* I'm an atheist, or a muslim... or something, he never really picked.
* I am dragging Tod from the church and his family.
* We don't spend any time at all with the family anymore. 
* We never spend any time with our niblings.
* We are wasting our life/time/money volunteering with animals.
* Helping/wanting to help refugees was un american and this is my fault since I am a first generation american and don't understand what it means to be one/deserve to live here. 
* I'm rude and never talk to them unless it's about animal rescue/animal rights


Yeah so... um. At this point we're kinda laughing and kinda crying and kinda shocked. We spent the rest of the day cleaning up our house and talking about what we wanted to do/reply back. We hadn't checked our email and we'd stuck our phones on vibrate and were just trying to enjoy our day off together, they're pretty rare sadly. So suprise! His parents drove all the way out to talk to us.

I say talk, but it was more like being talked at. They asked me to leave so they could talk to Tod about 'his actions/rude email'. Tod said no, said I was his family and his wife and we were handling this together. They then tried to convince us we had said fuck in front of the family. We didn't. That we had mentioned buying gifts for everyone before. That we didn't love Jesus anymore since we hadn't been going to church. And some of what Timmy has sent in the email too. When his Father started to insult me and then in turn my Father, Tod was done. He stood up and said ""Thank you for coming to visit us in our home for the first time but we have errands to run and you need to leave now."". They refused, he told them they had to go, now or he'd have to call the police. They left. He cried, I  cried, our cats knocked over their cups. 

We ended up calling my Dad and telling him everything as well as showing him both emails. He told us they have before talked shit about me/us to him. ""You should be able to fix your child still we're still working on ours."" was something he told us had been said. We decided we aren't going to their Christmas either way. I told Tod I can't go back there again, nor can I look at any of them the same again. I knew they'd always not liked me as much as some of the other daughter in laws but I didn't know it was to that extent. They have always been nice and polite to my face. Invited and included me in all events. No one had ever said anything to Tod either.

As it stands I'm waiting for my Dad and brother to get into town and then we're going to sit down and decide what we would like to do. Tod said he just wants it to be small and doesn't mind where Christmas happens and said he felt closer to my Dad and brother anyway.

We told Ben what happened and shipped his gift to him. I haven't decided yet what I will do with the niblings gifts but I already donated all of the adult gifts. 

TLDR I suck, Tod is pussy whipped bitch, we are blind, fuck it. All hail the red squiggle for making this spelling look less stupid. 

Edit TLDR: Sent email, got email back. Email sent around. Parents showed up, BS , all my fault, we aren't going to xmas or talking to them until after holidays are over. 

I'd also like to add I am not of another ethnicity. My father is German and moved to the US when he was 20 to marry my Mother.

510,dumbstruckhusband,? Locked Post ?,3ch6pe,2201,"Using a throwaway because I'm pretty active in some other subs and don't want this associated with my main account. 

My wife and I have been together since college and got married a little while after she graduated. When we first got together she told me she didn't really like kids and while I was a little disappointed, I didn't care too much about it. I didn't feel very strongly about it either way. We were very in love and things were perfect for a good while. Her birth control failed six years ago, and I told her that I would support whatever choice she made. She scheduled an abortion, but backed out the day before and we became loving and enthusiastic parents. Later on down the road, she decided she wanted another child and so we had our second daughter. They are five and three years old, and absolutely perfect. They are both very well behaved and ahead of the curve for kids their ages. 

Another thing that's worth mentioning, my wife is a SAHM. My job is very demanding and I am out of town for weeklong stretches at a time once a month, and then 9-6 the rest of the month. I've had this schedule since we were married, basically. I make good money, in the low six figures, and we've never had any kind of financial struggles.

For the past few months, I've known something was up with my wife. She is obviously the primary caretaker of our daughters, but recently she's been completely hands off when I'm at home. I don't mind spending the extra time with my daughters taking care of them, but it's more than that. She will completely ignore them while I'm around. If they ask her for anything at all she tells them ""go ask Daddy"" and will go in our bedroom and lock the door to get away from them. I've been asking her if she's alright, and she had been insisting everything was fine until last night. 

After we put the kids to bed, she came to me and sat me down at the table. She started talking about fun things we had done right after we got married, what a great adventure everything had been, just generally reminiscing. She was being sweet and funny and loving and my guard was down. She said ""back before we had the girls, we could do anything we wanted. I wish we could go back to that."" I asked her what she meant. After much prodding she admitted that she regretted having kids. I said that there were times where I felt overwhelmed too, but that I would always love our daughters. She got quiet. She mumbled something and I asked her to say it again. She yelled ""I DON'T LOVE THEM"" and then started sobbing.

I sat there with my mouth hanging open. She composed herself and then started talking again. She was saying how she had been looking into adoption agencies and foster care. She had contacted one agency already. She was making plans to give away my CHILDREN. I continued to listen, too dumbfounded to say a word, as she babbled on about how amazing it's going to be to have our lives back, how great our relationship will be when we don't have kids anymore.

I didn't know what to do. I let her talk herself out, and when she went to bed I went and got my babies, packed some things, and drove to my mother's house. I called in sick to work today. I told them I'd probably be out the rest of the week.

I have a ton of missed calls, voicemails, and texts from my wife. I haven't looked at any of them. I've spent the day talking to my mom about things and keeping the girls occupied. My mom doesn't know what to do either.

I'm thinking I have a couple of options: start calling lawyers or start calling mental health professionals. Maybe both. I don't know if she's having some kind of psychotic delusion or if she's just that awful of a person. I really don't want to go back home to her now. Ever. I'm thinking divorce is the best choice, but I can't take care of my kids on my own. What should my next move be? Should I try to call my wife?


   
**tl;dr**: Wife went off the deep end, tells me she regrets having our daughters (3 and 5) and wants to give them up for adoption so we can go back to our old life. I do not know how to proceed, in any regard. Please help me figure out how to handle this.

**EDIT: Additional Info

 She's not at home all the time with them. They go to pre-k for six hours a day four days a week. My mom takes them pretty much every other weekend. She gets a lot of time to herself, even though it could be more, and on nights when I'm home she goes out with her friends often, and lately when I'm home she doesn't see the kids at all... It's still possible that she's overwhelmed, but she's not the isolated 'barefoot and pregnant' chained to the stove woman you're picturing here.

We've both always been pretty low libido, I would say we have sex once a week and we try to have a date night every other week (leaving the girls with my mother). We are very affectionate towards one another.
She graduated with an art degree. When we first got married she was working as a teacher, she taught english and art in a local high school. She hated it, and she quit when she was pregnant with our first. She has a ""studio"" in our house, basically an extra bedroom with all her art stuff in it that the kids aren't allowed in, and she paints when the kids are out of the house. She feels like her degree is useless, but told me she wasn't interested in going back to school.

We used to pay for a weekly maid service, but my wife decided she didn't want to spare the expense.

I'm just looking for input right now. Honestly I feel like her response to this situation was completely out of line and nearly unbelievable, and I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship with someone who considers giving away her kids before even asking for help. She has consistently denied that anything was wrong and apparently put up a front to make me think that she wasn't struggling.**",1436305758.0,"Me [35M] with my wife [33F] of 9 years, wants to give up our daughters for adoption",0.94

Thanks to everyone who gave me great advice. I basically ended up breaking things off with him after he, once again, was acting very rude towards me. I briefly let him know it is because I thought he was disrespectful and didn't feel like he even liked me.

He acknowledged that some of his treatment towards me was ""unfair"" but said he ""wouldn't have spent time with me and talked to me if he didn't actually like me."" There was also some other BS in there about how he doesn't feel good about it and tried to tell me that it isn't a good place to be in. Nothing he said really made sense, as usual. Lol.

All in all, I am pretty happy about my decision and although it didn't last too long, I should have called it quits one week in. Lessons learned!

Thank you guys so much for your advice! Monday he was off and I had a job interview anyway, so I left my son with him.  He seemed very anxious as I was leaving, but I just told him he would do fine and if something drastic happened to call me. After my interview (which went very well, on a side note ) I called to check on him. He was laughing and telling me about the funny faces our baby was making! I told him since he had it under control I was going to run some errands while I was out. Long story short, I was gone for about 4 hours, and when I came home he was happy and cuddling the baby on the couch. It totally transformed him! He even took the baby with him to run errands on Tuesday by himself and gave me a couple of hours home alone! He is helpful and playful with the baby and it just makes my heart sing!

Before I get into this I want to thank everyone who messaged and commented, it really means a lot and the support was overwhelming and very very helpful, if I didn't reply I'm sorry but I tried to read every message. Thank you!

A little more backstory. 

(You can skip this if you just want an update on what happened) My family wasn't the closest. I do love them, but growing up as the oldest I was the one who always had to strive to be perfect and a role model. As soon as I started to try and be myself I was shot down and hurt, physically and mentally. I do still love my mother and father, they raised me in a really bad time and even through that I appreciate them. 

I met my girlfriend, C, in middle school. She was instantly my bestfriend and the one who made me forget about my home life, even if people made fun of her for hanging out with a kid. We started going out in my last year of highschool and through Uni. She was always the more mature and rational person throughout our relationship, while I was the one who over reacted and worried too much most of the time. Throughout our relationship she was always the one helping me, through depression, family problems, stress, anything. We never really had any bumps in our relationship, maybe we were holding stuff in but we were inseparable. 

There were times when other guys her age tried to make a move onto her but she always told me and was very adamant in telling me that she wasn't interested in anyone else and she did turn everyone of those guys down. Sometimes it felt like I was even a burden to her, making her feel like something I used only for comfort in tough times. Even then she would get mad if I tried keeping it to myself and urged me to always tell her, she did the same to me. Basically, our relationship was perfect to me, she was my best friend, I trusted and loved her more than my abusive family. I'd like to think I mean't the same to her.

Now to what happened after the original post. After updating I spent the early day at the motel reading all of your comments and trying to figure it all out. I called my buddy N and told him the gist of it. He was very kind and offered to move me in with him until I could sort myself out and by 12 pm the next day (When she left for work) we were at the flat gathering my things and moving it to his. The flat was very clean, cleaner then when I found her with someone else at least. She obviously tried to hide any evidence that anyone was there. 

After we finished moving I started figuring out what to tell her, if I did tell her anything at all. Some of you very generously sent me messages and comments helping me write a message. This is what I eventually sent her: ""I caught an early flight back and came home early. I'm going to go straight to the point, I saw you sleeping with someone else. We were supposed to spend the rest of our lives together, the fact you would do this to me, really shows me how you felt about me. If that's what you really want though, I'll move out. I'll keep paying my half of the lease, the landlord should fill you in on everything else. Please, for my sake at least, don't contact me ever again."" The rest of the day was a drunken blur and nothing much happened until the day after.

She came back home the next day and saw the message and flat. She didn't know where I was, but she did try calling me and texting. N wouldn't let me see at first, but after a while I eventually saw what she wrote back. It was mostly a jumbled mess of questions and apologies, but she did then this after she knew I wasn't replying, ""I'm sorry, and I don't expect you to forgive me. Yes I cheated, yes I lied to you. I still love you. I'm not asking for a second chance, but I felt lonely. I know that's selfish from me because of all you went through, and I know I'm a horrible person. I felt needy, you were away and when you came back you never talked about it. I needed someone to show me they cared. I know I'm selfish stupid and a bitch. I fucked up. I still love you. I'm sorry, goodbye."" That was the last text she sent me, two days ago. 

For the last two days I've been shamelessly bawling my sorry eyes. I know I shouldn't be the one crying, but I feel so alone. I have no one right now. She was the one person I trusted with my life, if she disregarded me so easily then what am I? I honestly feel like shit and I can write pages of how shitty I am right now. I actually don't know how I should feel. You guys really wanted and deserved an update and thank you for all the help so far, it really means so much.

We have a healthy sex life, we both have decent jobs that bring in decent money. In the past we talked about marriage a lot and would often joke about what our wedding would be like (yes i know how stupidly lame this sounds), however we always agreed we needed to settle down first. 

We bought a house about a year and a half ago, and were finally able to settle down. Our work schedules normalized, we were able to remove a huge waste of time from commuting, and we were finally able to take various activities after work (e.g. Dancing classes, cooking classes, etc). We were able to finally settle down. 

Finally we decided to take a week off and unplug on the week of 12 year anniversary. She wanted to go camping and hiking, and do the things we used to do when we were first dating. Unbeknownst to her i secretly decided to pick the exact same area where we met to do our hiking/camping trip. 

Two weeks ago as we are leaving she realizes where we are going and becomes ecstatic, and gushes about how romantic i am. More or less everything seems perfect. We do our hike, and we unpack, setup and by sundown everything feels perfect. So i decided to pop the question. 

This is where everything kind of falls apart, i ask her, and she just says ""no"". We literally went from ""i love you's"" to the single most akward silence i have ever had in my life in the time span of about a minute. We sat there kind of not saying anything before she says she is tired and goes to bed. She basically proceeds to cry her self to sleep while i sat there doing nothing. I basically didn't sleep and the next morning, she says she wants to go home. So we pack up and have a really awkward 3 hour hike back to our car. There were a few times where things kind of felt normal and we were joking around like we used to be for a bit. 

On the way back home, we are talking and chatting normally, but it just feels akward. At one point we stopped for coffee, and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened and all i got was a curt ""no"". This is followed by another extremely long silence for the rest of the drive home. We finally get home and i unpack everything while she goes off to bed she is going to bed.

Cue more crying, i tried really hard to talk to her but she pretty much told me that she just needs time to be alone and think. The next day she tells me she is going to take some time and see her family (which is literally on the other side of the country). 

It has been about two weeks since i dropped her off at the airport, she sent me a few messages to tell me she is fine, and that she needs some more time to think. Her best friend has been asking me every other day about what is going on with her, since she hasn't really been responding at all. I know she is okay though due to her posting some pictures of her and her family on Instagram. But it just feels really weird.

I am an absolute giant mess, i just don't quite understand what is going on. None of my friends have really offered me anything of value. I just feel if i didn't ask the question everything would be absolutely fine, and i don't really understand what is going on. 

I keep wanting to grab her laptop to try and figure out anything. I am not close to her parents at all, but i trust her and want to respect her space, but I don't know when she is coming back. I even sent her a message this morning and i know she saw the message and received it. But hasn't replied. 

Also her work has called me this morning asking about where she is. Apparently she had taken an extra week off last week, but she was supposed to be in yesterday.
   
**tl;dr**: Asked my girlfriend of 12 years to marry me, and she said no. Now everything feels like it is falling apart and i have no idea what to do. What should i do?

P.S. I am sorry if this comes off really rambly, i am just trash at writing, and have rewritten this half a dozen or so times. 

*EDIT* To clarify a few things.

The reason why it took so ong for us to get married, is we both agreeded we wouldn't move to the next step until we finished the following:

* We both finished school, for her that wasn't until 2 years ago
* We both had stable jobs
* We had a place where we could agree would be good enough to take stuff to the next step
* We both had decent working hours, for a long time she was doing her residency and we more or less worked opposite shifts.

We did talk about marriage, and kids and both agreeded it would be part of the next step after we got settled.

If you can't see the OP, try googling the title.

That thread blew up wayyy more than I thought it would. I had originally posted it before six months ago when the incident originally happened and didn't get any response - so I truly thought I was underreacting and kind of swallowed my concerns.. but over time they kept creeping up.. and I started noticing more and more that everything was my fault in his life so I decided to re-post it again. This post really affirmed what I knew but didn't want to accept for whatever reason - that the relationship had to end.

The thread made me think a lot about my life and what our life together would look like. All I could think about was this (his pissing himself) happening again in the future. I thought about us having children and how he would deal with them. I thought about having to make tough decisions with him. I thought about making tough financial decisions. I thought about having to go through tough life events like losing a parent. I realized that I would always be blamed for things that went wrong, even though they were not my fault or in my control and that he wasn't someone I could truly rely on for support. It just took him to literally, and purposefully, lose control of his own bladder for me to see this.

I broke up with him a few days after the original post. I told him I wasn't happy with the relationship anymore and that I wanted out. He didn't really fight or ask why, so it was a surprisingly easy break up. He has had other issues in his life and refuses in general the idea of therapy, so I didn't even suggest it for whatever issues he has going on when I ended it. Not really my problem or concern anymore.

Despite being together three years, I was surprised with how relieved I felt when I let it go (pun totally intended!). I think I mourned the relationship for a day or two, and I've been totally fine since. I've been hitting the gym almost every day at lunch and have had plans every night with friends or family (I generally am a social person) so I really haven't let the loss of this relationship get me down.

I guess if anything, this whole thing has really opened my eyes to trusting my gut and my instincts. I knew him pissing himself was fucked up, and I knew and felt like he was blaming me. I should have trusted my gut and ended it right then and there when he truly showed me who he was.

**EDIT:** People are messaging me saying they can't see the original post; I guess it got deleted. I'm going to repost it here, I hope that isn't against the rules.


My parent's have been married for almost 30 years. Their marriage is not great. My dad's the kind of person who will come home from work and get angry that there isn't dinner on the table. Growing up, my dad never treated my mother like an equal. She was expected to do all the housework and look after the children, and dote on her husband at all times. 


My parents have been empty nesting for a few years now. I have one younger sister, and we are both out of the house and have our own lives. Neither of us kids have particularly LIKED our dad. Like, we love him in the way that you love family, and we are grateful that he provided for us and helped us pay for college. But my dad is an asshole who treats my mom poorly, and I never respected him for this. 


I recently got brunch with my mother, and she dropped some pretty heavy news. She's planning on divorcing my father. I was honestly relieved and happy for her that she's finally doing this, but her plan to do so is rather troubling. 


My parents are Chinese immigrants. My dad's best friend growing up (Daniel) and his family have been saving up for a trip to the US for years. They will be visiting my parents over Christmas. My dad, naturally, put the burden of this whole trip on my mother. He told her to organize their whole vacation, planning meals, reservations, activities, etc. Basically my mom is expected to be the complete tour guide and handle all the stress and organization of their visit (including picking them up from the airport) while my dad just gets to hang out with his childhood friend and not deal with anything. My mom doesn't even KNOW these people.


Apparently, however, this was the last straw for my mom. She is retaliating. She has only been pretending to organize this trip and faked a bunch of reservations and stuff to appease my dad. My dad thinks everything is organized and Daniel's family is being completely taken care of. Her plan, instead, is to serve him with divorce papers the day she is supposed to pick up Daniel's family from the airport. My dad will be out of town on business up until the day Daniel arrives, so she will be moved out by then. Daniel's family will be stranded at the airport, and my dad will come home to an empty house and no family. 


While I support the divorce, I can't help but feel like this plan is a little too cruel. She can be as vindictive towards my father as she wants, but to drag another family into this seems unfair. My dad completely deserves this, but Daniel didn't do anything, and his family doesn't deserve to fly into the US and face this level of commotion.


Is it my place to say anything? I voiced to my mother my concerns and she basically was like ""fuck it and fuck him."" I barely talk to my father, but I don't know who I should reach out to or who I can talk some sense into. 


My dad has never been violent towards my mom or anything, but I'm also nervous about what would happen if I told my father the truth before my mom has had a chance to gather herself and move out of the house without him being present. It just seems like an explosive argument waiting to happen. 



**tl;dr**: My dads family friends are visiting. My mother was assigned the responsibility to handle their whole trip, including picking them up from the airport. Instead, my mom is going to do nothing and serve my dad divorce papers, leaving this visiting family stranded and cause a lot of commotion.


----------------------------------------------------------


**Now, on to the update...**

Thank you to everyone who replied. It's been about a month since my post. Reading everyones responses made a few things to me very clear, that I especially had not thought of before:


* It is highly unlikely that Daniel's family being ""stranded"" at a large international airport in the US would be that big of an issue. They speak good enough English, they have cell phones, they have money, they have my Dad's contact information. 


* My mom's decision to wait for him to get his news until he returns from his trip is a strategic one, so she can move out calmly and safely. While my father is not physically abusive, he certainly would not let my mom leave comfortably. She doesn't need that stress. 


* While some suggested that I step in and take over her duties, others claimed that it was risky for me to take over this role--my father may then just see me as replacement for his wife. This may set a bad precedent. 


* While I initially found her plan to be cruel, some of you rightly pointed out that surely this act of cruelty pales tremendously compared to the years of mistreatment she has dealt with. 


So, Reddit, I opted to know nothing and do nothing. Here's what happened. Around the time Daniel's family was to be picked up, I get a phone call from my father. I decided (especially since this was the middle of a workday) to ignore it, because I frankly did not want to get wrapped up in the commotion. He called again and then sent me a series of texts, demanding to know the whereabouts of my mother. 


Now, if you recall, my father had been on a business trip this entire week. His first chain of messages/calls was when had a layover in Denver. He was to be in Denver for 3 hours before he could get on his connection home. This means that, at this point, my dad is aware that Daniel's family has not been picked up (because Daniel obviously called my father) and that my mother was not answering her phone, but he did not know why. He also called my younger sister, who said she genuinely had no idea what was going on, but also lived out of state so was unable to help (I later find out that my sister was also briefed by my mother about what might happen so that she wouldn't get caught off guard, and she was just playing a fool to help my mother along). I eventually text my dad back saying I have no idea what is going on, but I'm very busy at work and won't be able to get back to him for a while.


My dad, unable to find immediate answers, told Daniel there must have been some miscommunication. He told them to get a cab from the airport to the house and just make themselves at home until my father could get to them. He gave Daniel the keycode to the house, told him to call back once Daniel and his family were safely at home.  


Here's where things get a bit theatrical. My mother apparently attached the divorce papers to an easel, with a nice big DIVORCE label and note, and placed the easel right at the entrance hall to the house so it's the first thing you see once you open the door. So, as you guess it, who get's the divorce news first? Daniel and his family. Daniel then has to tell my father that my mother is divorcing him. 


This is precisely what happens (Daniel recounts this in private to me later, which is how I know). But apparently my father went through a range of emotions, from disbelief, to a fumbling stutter, to anger, you name it. This, by the way, is happening while he is at the Denver airport, surrounded by his colleagues. He then has to, presumably, give some sort of explanation to his work friends and deal with an awkward and uncomfortable plane ride back home. 


Long story short, my dad was incredibly embarrassed and flustered. He had no idea what to do or how to help himself or anyone. Daniel actually ended up coming to the rescue, because he is apparently quite the meticulous planner and had many suggestions for activities and sightseeing. Basically, Daniel took charge of his own vacation, while my dad fumbled around like a lost puppy, just tagging along their trip while being completely discombobulated. 


I expected my dad to put on a farce for Daniel and his family and pretend things were fine, but he was unable to do that at all. I think he legitimately and honestly believed that my mom would never leave him, and was too much at a loss for words to even be angry. 


Later on, I stepped in to help out Daniel's family and make sure they were doing okay, giving my dad some time to himself. Overall, while they weren't wined and dined in quite the way the probably expected, Daniel seemed like a good and understanding friend, and they managed to have a productive vacation. Daniel said towards the end, when the shock had worn off, my dad and he were able to have a little fun. It was probably a good thing that Daniel was around to help my dad through it. 


As for my parents, in general, they are only communicating through their lawyers. My mom moved out to her own apartment. She hasn't told my father where she lives, and I am completely staying out of it. My mom seems like a brand new person to me. I am incredibly happy for her for being so brave and finally taking charge of her own life.


My dad is pathetic and completely helpless. He's been wrapping himself up in his work and eating lots of takeout. I've been careful with my involvement: I will be supportive enough so he doesn't feel completely alone, but I am adamant to not become some sort of caregiver for him. I refuse to answer questions about my mothers whereabouts, but I do express sympathy for her. It's important for me to make sure my father recognizes that honestly, I am on my mothers side, and that I never agreed with the way he treated her. That being said, I am also careful not to antagonize my parents towards each other. I want this breakup to be as clean as possible.  


**tl;dr** I didn't intervene. Daniel had to get to the house on his own, where he found my parents divorce papers. Daniel had to tell my father that my mother was divorcing him. Daniel ended up taking charge of his own vacation, my dad tagged along, I helped a little.

I have found myself in an incredibly strange situation. I live in a large city in the United States, and take the subway/metro to work every day. A few weeks ago, I was finishing up my breakfast outside the train station, and a little piece of toast got stuck in my windpipe. I tried to cough it back up but I couldn't breathe, and started freaking out. I ran to the nearest people, two men in their 20s/30s, and made it clear I was choking. One of them had a water bottle and I was able to drink some and dislodge the piece of toast. The two men were very concerned and made sure I was okay before I left, which I appreciated very much. I thanked them profusely and went on my way to work. I thought I would be done with this whole situation, but then things got weird. 

A few days after the choking incident, I was walking home from the store and all of a sudden a man runs up to me to stop me. I realize it was one of the men who helped save me, and he introduced himself (let?s call him ?John?). We started talking and I thanked him again. He then started telling me he?s been thinking about me every day and talking to me about religion and how he thinks God put me in his life. He then asked where I lived, to which I gave a very vague answer, and said ?I?m not going to ask for your number right now, but I would like to get to know you.? I told him that I am in a relationship, but that didn?t really seem to sink in. I told him I had to go, and the conversation ended with him saying ?I know I?ll see you again.? 

I saw him again the next morning. He was standing outside the subway/metro entrance I normally use (and where I choked). I realized it was him and tried to quickly go past him so he wouldn't recognize me?but once I was almost at the end of the escalator, I heard someone running down the steps. Sure enough, it was John. He had run all the way down the escalator to catch up with me, and he said ?I?m glad I saw you again. I?ll always be here for you.? I was really shocked, and said something like ?oh? before I turned and hurriedly walked to the train platform. 

After that incident, I started taking a different entrance to the train. I hadn?t seen him for a week?until I saw him again today. I was walking home from the store with my boyfriend, and all of a sudden I saw someone come up from behind my boyfriend. I realized it was John but acted like I didn?t see him, and kept focusing on talking to my boyfriend. John got weirdly close to my boyfriend and was staring at me, seeming like he was going to say something to me, but then he pulled back and my boyfriend and I walked away. After I told my boyfriend that it was John, we checked to make sure he wasn?t following us, and used the back entrance to our apartment. 

I am at a loss regarding what to do or what to think. I?m grateful to John and his friend for saving my life, but his behavior has become very inappropriate and weirdly threatening. From speaking with him, it?s clear that there?s not something quite ?right? about him, and I have no idea if he would have violent tendencies if I were to tell him to leave me alone. I hate feeling so trapped, and RESENT that this is the reality of being a woman in this world (can?t I just have a near death experience and have it not turn into some stalking situation??!?!). How should I approach this? Should I confront him or tell him off? Is this the beginning of behavior/stalking that is more sinister? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. 
  
EDIT: I should have made this more clear, but I expressed my disinterest in him multiple times during the second encounter. When he said he wanted to get to know me, I told him that I wasn't interested, that I needed to get on with my life, and that I am in fact in a relationship. The other two encounters happened too quickly and caught me too off guard for me to say anything, and as many others have pointed out, there is always the question of safety when faced with a man who can't seem to take ""no"" for an answer. Thank you for all the words of advice and support; I really do appreciate it.

519,nothanksgivingleftov,Relationships,79iolm,2192,"5 months ago, my BIL passed away from a heart attack. Since his death, my in-laws have been beside themselves, statements like ?they never saw this coming? and ?he was SO young, it could happen to ANYONE? have been common. The thing is, my BIL was not the paragon of health. Frankly, I?m surprised he made it to 34. First, my BIL lived with his parents and worked as a library assistant. He worked from 11-7, would get two large pizzas on his way home, eat the pizzas, leftovers at home, drink 1 or 2 2L sodas and smoke probably more than a pack of cigarettes (20 regular cigarettes) an evening. He hadn?t eaten a vegetable in more than 20 years ? something he was proud of ? had diabetes, a bad back (which is why he couldn?t exercise) and would help wind-down every evening with about a gallon of cheap beer. He?d wake-up at 8:45, microwave himself a few breakfast sandwiches/burritos (7 or 8) and would smoke another 10 cigarettes. He?d toddle off to work. He did that M-F, on Sat & Sun, he laid in bed till 2, watched TV, chain smoked cigarettes, ordered either Chinese take-out (meat only) or burgers, would drink beer from 4 until 1 or 2 AM and then pass out. He literally never left his room. 

BIL was warned by numerous doctors to get healthier, cut the smokes, stop drinking and to clean up, but he never did. Even when he got diabetes and spent almost a week in hospital, it didn?t phase him. He had begun to walk with a cane ? he was only about 5?7 but well north of 350lbs. He didn?t drink water, he didn?t eat a vegetable, he lived in his room and was never, ever healthy. Last year, he suffered a major heart attack and required emergency bypass surgery. He barely made it through the surgery, he was so unhealthy that he nearly passed away many times during surgery/recovery. He spent 3 weeks in the hospital. 

He got home and immediately resumed his habits. Just days after he got home, he was in bed, with a bag of cookies on his chest and an ashtray next to his bed. The home care workers tried, his surgeons tried, everyone tried to break him of his habit? Except his parents who didn?t want to upset their son?.

Anyway, a couple of months after surgery he died in bed. He had deteriorated rapidly, could barely move, had no energy, was white & gaunt and had trouble breathing. He refused medical attention and finally passed away. It was tragic, and everyone mourned. Since then, my in-laws have had their eyes-opened to the fragility of life and have been booking the ENTIRE family on events. I went along with it for a while, but it?s gotten excessive ? we?re expected to be with them every Saturday (even when they just sit around telling stories about someone who never existed?); we?re expected to be there when they need support and they?ve began booking us for every holiday: Thanksgiving & Christmas are being renamed ?BIL Remembrance Days?. No celebration but rather informal wakes will be held in his honor. 

I get they are sad and upset, but this is beyond crazy. My wife [28/F] has another sister [34/F] and brother [37/M].  They & their partners think this is getting out of hand. They?ve all pulled out of these events, but my wife won?t stand up to her parents. She?s the baby and doesn?t want to disappoint them. The thing is, it?s gone way beyond. My birthday involved my in-laws coming over and making a ?speech? (more like a lecture) about how deceased BIL would love this party. It went on for well over an hour, attempts to stop them failed and finally my mother had to physically remove them. They apologized when it became obvious everyone was so uncomfortable that they left. 

They need therapy, but they think this is all part of the grieving process. They refuse to talk to someone; they refuse to get help in any way whatsoever leaving my wife to carry the burden and for me to deal with their shit. They both informally ?retired? but can?t afford it; they didn?t really do their taxes (so I?m dealing with it) and aren?t keeping up with bills, so I?m their financial advisor. I haven?t had a weekend to myself in 5 months and I don?t want to give up holidays with my folks, so my in-laws can make-up stories about their son. I've had to help my FIL apply for jobs; I've had to give my MIL prepaid visa gift cards to prevent her from going wild on spending. I've structured their finances in such a way that they are okay, but what they need is long-term mental help to get them working again. 

I know it sounds cold & callous, but I?ve hit my limit. How can I get my wife to take my side and deal with her parents who obviously need therapy and support?

520,gawsharon,Non-Romantic,5lms23,2184,"I met my friend Chuck (29M) about 1.5 years ago. We were both part of an online local group for single parents, and eventually met offline with other group parents. I have known Britt (25F) since high school. 

Chuck's wife died of childbirth complications the day their daughter was born, more than two years ago. Britt is a few months out of a 9-year relationship. Both of them have expressed wanting to meet other people, and I thought they'd be good for each other because of common interests and we all have kids of similar ages. 

Two days before Christmas, Chuck and Britt went out on their first date. I kept Chuck's daughter at my house so the two could have some more time together without him having to worry about the baby.

The plan was for her to spend the night (she's done it before and gets along great with my 3 year old girl), but Chuck knocked on my door at 11pm to get his daughter. He barely said a word to me and I could tell he had been crying, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. 

The next day, I asked Britt what happened. She said that they had dinner and a couple drinks, things were going excellent. She said she felt like they had great chemistry and were even getting physical at his house, but he suddenly told her to stop and to leave immediately. She swears that she has no idea what she did wrong and is really hurt by the whole thing. I believe her because she is really sweet and social, I've never seen her do anything to piss anyone off. 

I tried to talk to Chuck at the same time to get his side of the story and see what went wrong. All he said that he ""wasn't feeling it"" and didn't want to discuss it further. I didn't push it, but when I went to wish him a merry Christmas a day later, I saw he had deleted me from his social media. I texted it to him instead and asked ""you okay?"" but no response. 

I am seriously hurt and don't know what to do. Chuck has become one of my closest friends, and our daughters are the best of friends too. I am really worried that this has something to do with his wife, and I want to apologize if he felt like I was pressuring him to date after her death. At the same time, I don't want to overstep boundaries and bother him when he's having a hard time. It's been over a week and I'm worried/upset. 

**tldr: I set my two friends up on a date. Things were apparently going well until my guy friend suddenly called off the date. He has now deleted me from his social media and will not talk to me.**

**EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.**

**EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your advice, everyone. I think I will give it another week before I speak with him again. If he hasn't reached out by then, I will tell him that I am still here if he needs to talk but I will continue to give him space if he needs that, too. I am almost 100% sure that this happened because of his wife's death. Another one of my friends who is still on his Facebook saw that he had changed his cover photo several times since Christmas, and all of them were from his wedding.**

My Boyfriend - Max
My Ex boyfriend - James 
Max's Ex girlfriend - Brooke

2 weeks ago I received a text from an unknown number, claiming they were my ex boyfriend James. I believed it was James as he did write a status on Facebook saying he had a new number. It was just casual talk ""how are things?"" ""How's your new boyfriend?"" I replied platonically and friendly as we did end on good terms. 

My current boyfriend Max said if I am talking to my ex then he should be allowed to speak to his ex Brooke.
I said that's fine, you can speak to who you want although you know I won't like that. I wasn't happy because the only reason I ever stopped him talking to Brooke is because their messages were always flirty and she still sent him nudes. So I asked him to block her, and he did. But He said he would talk to her anyway because I am speaking to James. 

That was that.

A few days later, Max went to make dinner, and I was up in the bedroom. I was looking for some socks from Max's drawer, and I found a cheap mobile phone that I never saw before. I looked on it and it was the texts I sent to James. I was livid. He was pretending to be my ex boyfriend?

I confronted max straight away, and he admitted that he wanted to get back in touch with Brooke, and he thought if I spoke to my ex James, he could use that as an excuse to be able to talk to Brooke.

I am pissed off. I am really angry that he had to do this behind my back. I asked to see his messages between Brooke and they are all flirty and just borderline inappropriate.

Tldr ; my boyfriend pretended to be my ex so he could speak to his ex. We live together, + own a dog. Is this salvageable? where do I go from here?

My boyfriend really likes Facebook. I have had no reason to not trust him 100% with it. He's definitely a like every photo/status kind of guy and just thinks that it is fun. I don't have a facebook, and my presence on his is nonexistent besides the mention of fun things we are doing here and there. I realize now that I could easily be mistaken for a friend/sister/cousin/etc. 

About 3 months ago, I got tipped off from a friend that he had been a little flirty with a girl on Facebook. I did a quick cyber stalk of her and she was gorgeous, and I noticed instead of the typical like he had been ""loving"" and ""wowing"" her pictures. I called him and told him I felt a little bit crazy, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any funny business. He assured me he is just being nice, and they've never met (she is a friend of a friend apparently?) and it is no different then me upvoting something on Reddit. They had messaged a few times but it was totally innocent and looks any flirtations were nonexistent. Ok, I dropped it, but my spidey senses told me to bookmark it, instead of completely discard the thought of her forever.

A new movie is coming out tonight, and conveniently our favorite dive bar/dinner spot is RIGHT across from the movie theater. We just have to walk a few feet or so and there we are. We have both been stoked for his movie, and talking up our date night ALL week.

I was going into a work meeting and texted him ""Hey I'll probably be tied up till after 5, so i'll see you at *name of place* at 7!"" 

He texts me back (verbatim, to show how weird this was). ""Hey umm is there somewhere else?"" 

I don't know what it was, but after a few months of not even thinking of this mysterious facebook enigma, something shouted at me to look at her profile. Her profile is absolutely 100% open, there is no privacy. She geotagged how excited she was to see the movie and go to the bar. Hmm....Ok that is a little convenient. Did a little more digging, he's loved even more of her pictures.

Shortly after, he asks if we can just have a night in (which is weird, because my place is being remodeled and the only access at my house is the bathroom and bedroom, and he just had his fumigated and is staying at his moms). I'm like where da fuh are we staying in at?? I have already bought the movie tickets and I told him that I didn't want them to go to waste so to please come we can go eat at another nearby place.

I just think this is all awfully convenient. Am I being a total loon in thinking he doesn't want his girlfriend and side piece running into each other at the movie/dinner?
  

Update!!!: first of all, you guys rock. It is nice to have an army of wonderful Internet friends. So long story short. After the movie I went to the bathroom and Facebook girl was also in there. I told her I loved her hair and then we were just girl chatting, and I was chatting with her out of the door where my boyfriend was waiting for me. He looked like he was going to faint. I was like ""babe! Meet my new friend!"" He was cheating on me with her. They had been having sex for a few months, and he said he was just in a casual relationship with me. Right a casual relationship with a house being built and joint finances???? Good hell. She told me since I have fake boobs I just wasn't enough for him and that was her justification for being ok with it, because I have fake boobs. It was weird like she knew who I was when we were chatting in the bathroom. So no damn girl power there. He didn't even seem sorry, which sucked because he really was my best friend. I don't make a lot of friends since I'm a trauma nurse and just don't get out much. I'm really sad, and feeling really stressed out and just broken. I also feel yucky, I'll get checked for STIS and all that jazz on monday. Time to fix this heartbreak. I took the weekend off of work. Ugh this sucks. Thanks guys you are all so wonderful and encouraging!

**Edited this for clarity. My phone sort of sucks.**

The TLDR is pretty much the gist of it. 

I (29f) am not close with my half sister Kara (33f). She has always been very clear about not wanting to be close. She never takes up offers to stay with me and the only times I have seen my 'nieces' have been when I ask. I drive up, I take them out to dinner, and she calls the night short because they have an early bedtime. 

She has told me that she doesn't want them calling me auntie because it would be validating my father's cheating. Which is true, I am the cheating baby. Still, I wanted to have a relationship with my nieces *4 and 6* but have now pretty much given up. 

I talk to them on the phone bimonthly. I sent presents and write them letters. 

I am much closer to my brother's kids and am an auntie to several friends' offspring. 

Kara (33f) called me up last month and asked to get coffee. We are about two hours apart, so it's a bit of a drive to see her. I agreed, she sounded rough. While Kara is my half-sister, she has no relation with my brother (who was adopted). There isn't a lot of other family members around to ask. Most are either too old, too young, or not a match. My aunt (67) could not donate even if she was a match. Most of Kara's friends have tried and they are not matches. 

She asked me to get tested. I agreed, thinking I wouldn't be a match. Turns out I am. My husband and I decided that I wouldn't donate because we want to have kids in the future and I don't want to risk my health. The doctor agreed to tell Kara I am not a match. 

I have seen what happens to people who donate. I have a friend who donated and her life is fucked. She has a lot of health problems, couldn't do the things she did before, and she is only 27. At 29, I don't want to suffer the same fate for the rest of my life.  

I just wonder if I should be honest with her at all? Will it do any good to tell her I am a match but I have reasons to not do it (wanting to have a child, not wanting to be ill?) Would it just make it worse? 

She has already been told that I am not a match and put on a waiting list. Part of me thinks I am being selfish for wanting to tell her. Another part of me feels I shouldn't be lying to her about who I am. We have never been close, so I feel it's wrong to pretend I am on her side when really I am deciding to put my own health and life first.

524,notcheech,Relationships,52mn13,2177,"My husband Derek and I have been married for 3 years, together for 7 total. 

Several years ago (about 6 now, I guess), I worked closely with a male coworker, Paul, that Derek was never fond of. Paul and I *never* had an inappropriate relationship. Derek's jealousy wasn't completely out of nowhere, I get why he felt that way. Those couple years were a perfect storm of relationship stress; I was working long hours, we were living apart after trying and failing to move in together, our relationship was still *fairly* new, and then you add in a handsome coworker I had to spend long hours with and saw more than my boyfriend at the time. 

Paul was the source of several fights. Again, we never did anything that wasn't completely kosher. Eventually I told Derek he needed to trust me and get over it, or we were going to have to break up. He said he would stop worrying, and for the most part things were good. When Paul transferred out of state a few months later, things were really good. There were no worries at all and our relationship has been amazingly strong ever since. 

This last weekend, my husband went out with a couple friends to some bars and a football game. When he came home, he was pretty wasted. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned how a friend of his had told him that he broke up with his girlfriend because she cheated on him. I commented on how that was a bummer and good for him for finding out before they got too serious. Derek, however, had a different take on it. He said it was a shame because they had seemed like a good couple and if they really loved each other his friend could move past the cheating, just like he had with me.

At first I thought my husband was admitting to cheating on me, and asked him what he meant. He told me he always knew that Paul and I had slept together ""at least once"" all those years ago, but he knew I was the one for him and forgave me. 

I told Derek that I had never so much as even hugged Paul (except maybe at his going away party), let alone slept with him. Derek sort of just patted me on the arm, said ""Of course"", and passed out. The next morning I asked him about the conversation and he said it was okay, he had forgiven me, it wasn't even an issue. I again stressed that I had never cheated on him with anybody and I needed him to believe me. He sort of did the same ""Of course you didn't, babe *wink*"" thing again and went to work.

Every time I've tried to talk to him since, he won't hear me out. I'm this close to losing it with him. I need him to know that I never cheated, and I'm hurt that he thinks I would do something like that. What do I do? Do I just let him have this since it's not really hurting anything, or what? I don't want my own husband to think so little of me that he thinks I would cheat. That's not who I am.

My husband and I tried to clean as much as we could and we sent the girls off to school before going to work. I can't even express how fucking pissed off I am. My husband and I allow our daughters leeway as long as they maintain their grades and don't do really stupid things (Like throwing a party they were told not to).



My youngest daughters excuse was that it was her best friends birthday and they wanted to surprise her and my older daughter called some friends who invited more people over and apparently it all snowballed from there.

tl;dr daughters threw party, house got thrashed, mum & dad are extremely angry, appropriate manner of handling this?



EDIT:- My husband and I have been talking about possible punishments, some seem too harsh, some not harsh enough, hence why I made this post. Some ideas we had though were to:-


 Take away their cell phones as well as social media access, my husband is a software engineer and they definitely won't be getting around whatever the heck it is he can do to lock stuff down. 


Take away their going out privileges, no more of that for a long while.




No having friends over or going to their places after school.



No giving of allowances to our daughters and our eldest who got her job because of a friend of my husbands will have some of her paycheck for a while going towards replacing the items (that can be replaced).




Of course we will be having a serious conversation or 5 with them and giving additional chores, I also spoke to the mother of my daughters best friend and she only knew there was a small surprise party at our house, so I'm guessing that among my daughters friends, no one really knew there would be a huge ass party.",1441295996.0,"My (46f) daughters (18f) (17f) threw a houseparty while my husband and I were away, even though we explicitly told them not to do this, house got thrashed, some items of great sentimental value got broken as well as some other expensive stuff, how the hell do I approach this?",0.92

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who commented on my original post. In my everyday life, I am the problem solver, the fixer, so I was looking at this entire situation as a problem that I needed to solve. I knew if I asked you guys what to do, you would all see it from a prospective that I was just to close to see.Thank you all for showing me that not only was any of this my problem, but also that it was NOT my responsibility to do anything at all in this situation.

Clearly, I have shit that need to work on and keep working on. My husband has helped me over the 11 yrs we have been together. I used to be like a field mouse and absolutely terrified to say no to people, sometimes even crying over it. Thanks to the people on here who suggested it, I'm actually going to start practicing saying, standing up for myself and letting No be a complete sentence. My husband said I can practice on him whenever I need to and we will start working g on it today.

Okay so- The Update!
Sunday night I called my Mom and told her everything. I pointed out that we will be gone on the weekend Lea was wanting to get married on and said that for once, I would be putting my foot down. We WILL be going on the trip. My mom laughed and said not to worry and that Lea has lost her damn mind if she thinks any of us will pay for anything. I told her to call my Dad before my sister had a chance to lie to him. My Dad said the same thing as Mom and decided to call Lea's Dad to find out what was going on.

Lea's Dad said he told Lea that since he just bought her a car and his business is getting ready to shut down for winter, he could not afford a wedding for her this year. He told her to put the wedding off till around May of next year and that would be enough time. Lea lost her shit. Her Dad said after a lot of screaming, she finally yelled ""I'll pay for it myself!!"". And apparently in Lea's mind, that meant getting all of us to pay for it. My Dad said he needed to tell Lea that not a single  one of us will ever pay for her to get married, ever and if she just absolutely has to, she can do it at the courthouse.

Later that night Lea's Dad called my Dad back and said he sat Lea down and demanded to know WHY she was pushing for a wedding g so soon. Turns out, her boyfriend is joining the Navy and they thought it'd be a good idea to get married. Her Dad told her that none of us are paying anything for her wedding and she would have to go to the courthouse if she had to but there will be no wedding this year. After an hour of yelling, Lea said fine and she will just move the wedding to next year but honestly, if her boyfriend is going away, I can totally see her finding a new guy while he is gone and this whole wedding thing going a way. 

So thank you all so much for helping me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r3lu6/my_family_was_robbed_and_we_know_who_did_it_how/

Thank you /relationships for your advice. It actually helped me emotionally, and lead to catching the perpetrator! And yeah, confronting them would have been an idiotic idea (we found knives and they have gang connections, read OP) so thank you guys getting that idea out of my head.



So a few people advised I look at pawn shops and trading sites. I took the advice and set up notifications for every post in to the local Facebook trading pages. When through hundreds...but then I saw my stuff! It was just a bag and a few dresses. I logged on to my boyfriend's Facebook account and removed my family from his friends list so the thief doesn't connect him back to us. I sent the person (she used a fake profile) a message and started a conversation about the bag, pretending I was interested. Mum called the police and they turn up to our house as I still talking to the suspect. Once I knew I had her, I asked for the address. Boom. It was the house we had suspected. The police move in immediately. It was kind of exciting! I had set up a sting, thanks to you guys!



We get updated later that day that they retrieved some of our stuff from three different houses?!? Turns out there were at least 5 people who had come through our house, which is absolutely terrifying. But that does explain how they managed to wipe so much stuff. There is one adult going to court, and the girl is getting referred to a youth justice Family Group Conference.


They didn't have our more valuable items any more. So the TVs, bike, and a chandelier (they even took the lightbulb). I am still keeping an eye out but we are most likely going to have to replace them, which means saving up a couple thousand dollars just because some people decided to be cunts. Ugh. We can seek financial reparation but the officer said these people are of a low socio-economic status so it could just be $10 a week. Bye, Christmas travel.



Thank you guys so much for your support. I will update if anything else happens but I think this is the end. I am still angry and hurt, but I'm starting to accept what has happened. I've cleaned up most the mess they left and the house is feeling like home again. I feel closure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, thanks to everyone who gave their opinions and advice. I really didn't expect my post to get much attention so I appreciate all the time people put in to offering me solutions to this issue.

After reading everything everyone said, and taking a few days to sleep on it, I finally decided to talk to Stephanie about the situation. A lot of people recommended that I straight up tell her she's overweight and she's not this thin person she thinks she is, but after really thinking about it, I felt that it wouldn't be beneficial to her mental health, no matter if she has BD or not, for me to do that. I felt it would be more appropriate for me to emphasize the parts of whatever is going on with her mental health that are negatively impacting our relationship and continue to push her to get help.

So that's what I did. I sat down with her Friday night and I told her that the issues she's struggling with mentally have become a barrier in our relationship. I explained to her that I felt that she sometimes stood behind her mental health problems as an excuse to not be a good partner, or to justify bad behavior that hurt me and our relationship. She wouldn't really acknowledge this at first but she eventually conceded that it's not fair to blame her behavior on any mental health issues and that she knows she uses it as a crutch because she gets embarrassed of the way she behaves. 

Then I talked to her about the BD. I explained to her that it feels to me like she is letting it define her as a person, and she lets her life revolve around it, and I don't feel that it's empowering her or helping her and I want her to get help. She told me that she feels her forum and personal research is help but I told her that this has been going on to some degree for our entire relationship and that just because she feels that she has discovered what is ""wrong"" with her doesn't mean she has fixed it. I told her that if she seriously feels that there is something wrong within her that is keeping her from being the person she wants to be, she needs to get help. 

Now, a lot of commenters felt that she didn't have BD (I'm still undecided) and that I needed to tell her she is just overweight. I was definitely not comfortable doing that. I don't think I am qualified to make a diagnosis and regardless of whether it is BD or it isn't, there is something wrong here and I am not capable of fixing it myself. 

So anyway. I told her all of that and we both cried. She told me she feels horrible for the way she has acted at times and she knows that it's not her, and this is why she brings up the BD in fights, because she doesn't want me to feel that the person she can be when we fight is who she truly is. I told her I know she isn't that person, but that since she isn't able to control herself when she gets that upset, she needs to talk to someone who can give her coping mechanisms.

We ended up looking into our county health resources for indigent people with no healthcare (her income qualifies her as indigent) and found two potential places in the area that offer low-cost mental health services to qualifying people. Stephanie texted me this morning (I'm at work) and told me she left a message for one of the facilities and she scheduled an intake appointment at another one of the facilities. The intake is free and then they discuss cost, payment plans, etc. when they make their ""treatment plan"". This suggestion from a commenter really saved our relationship, so thank you so much to everyone who suggested it.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel horrible that I came across in my post that there was nothing good about Stephanie or that I didn't respect or love her - I love her tremendously, and she is a great person who struggles with mental health issues, as many of us have in our lives. I believe she is committed to making a change, and I guess at the end of the day, whether or not she has BD isn't the biggest issue here, and making my post made me realize that. The biggest issue is that something is unwell with her mentally and she needs the proper treatment to feel better, and in turn be a better partner.

TL;DR We had a long talk and Stephanie agreed to get help. She made an appointment this morning for an intake appointment with a county resource for low-income people with no healthcare, and is going to pursue treatment.

529,Familyheiress,Relationships,3j5fnj,2168,"I want to make it clear that I've always spent money on my boyfriend, buying him nice things and what not. He got his PS4 and new gaming PC because of me. My boyfriend however found out that I have a good amount of money and has started to be quite weird about it.




Several times he's referred to my money as our money and using our money to buy him the luxury car he's dreamt of having, he wants us to move out of separate apartments and get a house together and has said instead of getting him a small Christmas gift that I should fund a trip for him to see Europe. (I'm from Italy and have family in Bulgaria, Croatia and The Netherlands) and he is from Canada.





Buying the luxury car, it's less whether I can afford it and more that seems like something you get your husband or wife and not your boyfriend of 3 years. The house I can understand, if we were engaged or something but we aren't though he has talked about marriage several times in the past few months and finally yes, I can afford a trip for both of us to tour Europe but whereas it's something I might have thought of for us to do before, he only brought this up after finding out that I do have the money to pay for it.




Is this reason enough to break up with him?

For a little bit of background:

My sister and I have the same dad but different moms (my dad left her mom for my mom. I know. It's kinda shitty.) Neither of my parents have more than a grade 9 education,  and both make just slightly above minimum wage. My sister (like every other woman in my family) got pregnant when she was 16, and moved out on social assistance. I wanted to break the cycle, and although I tot pregnant at 20, I went to university, married the father of my child and am now working towards my Masters. I have a lot of pride in the fact that I broke a 3 generation teen pregnancy, high school drop out cycle.

My sister now has five kids ranging in age from 10-3. Normally, I couldn't care less how many kids someone has because it's none of my business, but this whole situation is impacting everyone negatively. 

My sister and her husband do not work. They have to get Christmas hampers, borrow money, and live on social assistance. They also don't take care of their house. It's literally like an episode of hoarders in there. There's cat and dog poop all over the floors, mouldy food everywhere, dirty diapers etc. My nephew was once so hungry I caught him eating a bowl of mouldy cheerios once when I visited(I'm tearing up just writing that). We have all gone there multiple times to try and help them clean up, and have gotten 2-3 dumpsters full of garbage out each time. 

Every time my husband and I take the kids, we have to take them out and buy them clothes for while they're staying with us. The clothes they come in don't fit, reek like cat pee and are always inappropriate for the situation. For example, every summer we take one of them camping (they never get to do anything with out all their siblings and it's something they each look forward to each year).  It was a 6 day camping trip and all that was in my nieces bag were a pair of her older brothers jogging pants (he's 10, she's 5!) And a weird ripped fleece dress that was 3 sizes too small. This is a common occurrence. 

On Sunday we had our sons birthday party and all the nieces and nephews were invited. 3 of them don't have any winter gear and were wearing Jean jackets and running shoes in negative 10 degree weather. The oldest had dog poop on his pants, and the youngest had gum stuck in her hair. The entire time all my sister would talk about was how they can't wait to have their sixth child and they're already trying.

I'm honestly shocked. They have no means to take care of the five of they have. I get that it's not really my business, but the fact is, children's services are already very involved. If things get any worse, they will lose all the kids and the general family consensus seems to be that I'll take them in when that happens. I love those kids, but my husband and I have worked extremely hard to be able to give our two children good lives. I don't want to sacrifice their happiness and well being because of someone else's mistakes. 

On top of all this, my sister has been diagnosed with some sort of personality disorder and her psychologist straight up told her she should stop having babies because it's negatively affecting her. 

I'm so saddened by this. I want to help them but I'm honestly out of ideas and patience. 

So Reddit, should I just bite the bullet and take the kids in when they get removed? Child services has given them one last chance to fix the situation, and the two of them haven't done anything about it. Or should I let them go into the foster system? I just need outside perspective. 
Edit: I also wanted to ask if there is any way I can help my sister besides the cleaning etc? She's clearly over her head and I'm concerned with her mental well being. I want her to get better so she can keep her children. 

TLDR: sister has 5 kids, wants a sixth. Child services is threatening to take the children, and family wants me to take them.

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tblls/update_i_27_m_think_my_wife_27_f_has_insulted_me/

I just thought I owed it to this community to give everyone an update to what happened. As you can imagine, I've had a chaotic week so far and it has been intensified by the upcoming holidays. 

I met with my lawyer friend this last weekend and had a five hour heart to heart with him. He reiterated many comments that were posted in the above threads, and told me that him and other people had noticed little things here and there throughout my relationship with my wife. There was a lot of crying as I broke down, but I was happy to finally have honest support from someone IRL through this. He advised me to get copies of documents that proved that I had complete ownership or partial ownership of our home, cars and other items, and I have secured all of this as of today.

I have not seen my wife or my children since Sunday evening. That night we had a loud, painful argument. I yelled at her for the first time, and she called me a loser and a useless man, and blamed the impending doom on me. I have 75+ missed calls on my phone from her and her parents and even more text messages, some from our oldest child saying she doesn't want to ""see daddy anymore"". I suspect my wife and her parents have been putting her up to it, but it is extremely heart breaking to say the least.

My marriage is over. My life is crumbling. 

I am bracing myself for the worst. My friend has introduced me to someone who can help me file for the divorce, and the estimated time for my wife to be served with these papers is by the end of the work day. My only regret is that I won't be there to see her face. After re-reading the two threads for a week, I am sure I never want to see that woman's face again. Unfortunately this will be inevitable during the divorce process.  

Some of you will be pleased to know I am not barricading myself in a cheap motel, but am taking a well earned little stay in a luxury hotel in the city, right by my office. Just figured I might as well enjoy life before shit hits the fan. Room service and house keeping all the way!

I want to thank everyone again for your advice and support. Please, if there is anyone out there who has been through this, I would love further support and advice. I will be checking back on this throwaway and thread throughout the day. 

I am done posting update threads on /r/relationships. If there is anything you would like to know about my situation, I can answer in the comments of this thread or via PM. 

Lots of love, and happy holidays everyone! I'll be spending the holidays locked in my hotel room eating peanut butter sandwiches all by myself.

Many thanks to all the people that posted advice on the previous post :) 

Alright so I just had the talk with my Dad with my mum next to me, which I recorded to be on the safe side.
I told him that I recommend that he went to the doctors and had a mental evaluation, as enhanced aggression is a sign of dementia. I also told him that ""if [he] ever fucking touches me again, I will call the police."", to which he told me to ""Mind my language"" (because him attacking me is fine but me swearing at him is apparently too far). He then went on to say (after saying ""now that you've finished your lecture"") that somehow I pushed the wrong buttons last night (insinuating that it was my fault he attacked me) and that the only other time this has happened was also with me. 

I held my ground and told him that regardless of me ""pushing the wrong buttons"" attacking your own son is completely unacceptable and that if it had been anyone else, they would have called the police and he would be in jail.


I then added that it would be a while before I could trust/ talk to him again, and that all the effort over the past year to have a better father / son relationship has been completely wasted. 

I don't think he fully understands the gravity of the situation, but fuck him if he thinks he can do that to me and get away with it. I'm a god damn adult.

533,Whatdoesamomwear,Relationships,4i1s45,2154,"Dan and I have been married for 3 years and 8 months ago welcomed our amazing son into the world. He was very planned and wanted and motherhood had been transformative for me. I was able to take 4 1/2 months maternity leave before going back to work. Without going into too many details, we both work white collar jobs that require professional attire. A normal work day look for me is a skirt or pair of slacks, a silk blouse, pumps or boots depending on the weather (but always with a heel because I'm 5 foot nothing), maybe a blazer if I have a big meeting. Dan wears a suit almost everyday. I also style my hair and do some makeup for work everyday. This is what I wore before our son was born and what I continue to wear. 

Dan and I are pretty even in sharing parenting duties. I tend to take mornings because I'm more of a morning person that Dan. A normal morning for me starts early, short workout, shower, get baby up, get ready, get baby ready and baby off to Dan because the daycare is on Dan's way to work. I'm normally dressed at the tail end of this process but I keep my robe on over my clothes in case my son wants to give my outfit something to remember him by on our way out the door. 

For the last month or so, Dan has been more irritable than normal in the morning. There have been side comments if he gets up and I'm drying my hair or getting dressed- basically if I'm not 100% focused on my son in the am. Our son is happy playing and supervised so I just chalked it up to morning moodieness but it's been getting worse. 

Last night I brought it up in what I thought was a neutral, non confrontational way. Basically his answer was this:  his mom was 100% a mom after her kids were born. She gained a fair amount of weight after she had kids and never tried to lose it. She wore sweatpants everyday and works a job where she wears a uniform so if she wasn't in her work uniform she was in sweats and a tshirt. She never did her hair or make up. Her entire identity was being a mom and she's shared with me how hard it was to watch her kids start their own lives. Dan thinks I don't care about our son as much as he does since I worked on losing the baby weight and still put effort into my appearance. 

I feel like keeping this part of my identity actually helps me be a better mother. I love my son but I'm still me and I still have the things I like to do. Dressing wel my identity actually helps me be a better mother. I love my son but I'm still me and I still have the things I like to do. Dressing well, blowing out my hair and doing my make up are therapeutic to me. Now that being said, my son is my life  and if I knew that not doing those things but guarantee him a happy healthy life I would stop immediately.  I told Dan that my son and I have our morning routine and he gets lots of time and attention before I go to the office. Dan said he wasn't looking to fight but he just wanted me to think about my priorities and my time management. 

 Is it normal for new moms to totally sacrifice all the things you like to do? Is this a sign of something deeper I need to address with my husband?

It says 12 years in the title because me and my wife just celebrated our 12 year anniversary. I took her on a nice dinner and we had a good time but you dont want to hear that romantic shit on with the update.


**Update**

So, where to begin after my post I decided to tell my wife after the kids were settled. I sat her down and I told her this woman had flirted with me in the past and has generally made me uncomfortable.

I told her I didn't reciprocate any attention or flirting but there was something i needs to tell her.

I told her she came into my office and was talking to me and then took off her clothes. (She asked if we did anything) and I said absolutely not and I would never cheat on her.

She then started laughing and said she must of wanted to make a porno with me. (She knows about the camera because she's brought me lunch before and saw it) we both laughed and she just told me she trusts me and is glad that she has a faithful husband.

She took it better than i thought but I was glad I got that off my chest but I still had stuff to do. I reported her the video was reviewed and long story short she was fired. (She gave me the evilest looking eye anybody has ever given me in my entire life)

I would like to say I talked out of there like a badass but I still had paper work so I had to work. But after I was done I felt better actually, this felt like a weight on my shoulder.

Side note for people who want to hear our romantic 12 year anniversary:

So, I knew our 12th anniversary was coming up so this is what I did for her. I tried hard to remember where our first date was and after looking at an old picture I saw the name.

I asked my sister if she could watch them and I took her out for a special night. We had fun and she was really happy and honestly I'm very happy with my life.

We tried uh.....getting busy but my daughter was being a turd and pushing into my wife's rib cage. She felt uncomfortable so we stopped and I'm kinda laughing thinking about. Cockblocked by my own daughter.

All I can think of was I never planned for this. We talked about adopting a child or two. We bought our first house together back in January, we talked about spending our Christmas in the Caribbean as we both really can't handle the cold. All I have these days is my job and every single person there treats me like a fragile toy or something. It gives me something to do though, it kills half my day so I don't spend that time bombarded with memories. 



The rest of the time though, every single thing reminds me of her. My friends are completely supportive and so are my family members but it's just not helpful you know? It doesn't change the fact that the love of my life is gone. It doesn't change the fact that I don't know if I will ever love anyone the way I loved her, if at all. I know how melodramatic this sounds but it's how I feel. 



I don't know how to be better despite so many people saying it'll be easier. 


Does it get any easier? Because it's only gotten worse for me.

536,dumpordiscuss,Infidelity,3duhei,2150,"Our first year anniversary is in two weeks. We went out last night to a birthday party of our mutual friend's. He got pretty tipsy but not wasted; I didn't drink since I was driving us home. At some point in the night I went to go get water and when I came back, there was a crush of people in the room so I was standing directly behind him, trying to get through. 

He was talking to some girl and I heard her ask, ""So is that girl you came in with your girlfriend?"" And he distinctly said after some hesitation, ""No, she's just my roommate haha."" I got really pissed off but didn't say anything, just came up to stand next to him. I didn't want to make a scene at my friend's birthday party, but he was going to get an earful when we left. He didn't even notice me for a few seconds and said something like, ""You're so pretty,"" to the other girl. She noticed me 
glaring at him and left. 

I was so pissed off at him that I just decided to walk away and talk to my friends the rest of the night. Probably a mistake of not addressing it right there at the time but I wanted to avoid a big scene if I could. I tried to enjoy myself. My friend, the host of the party, came up to me and asked me if my boyfriend and I had broken up and she didn't know, because she had heard him telling somebody that he was single.

After that, I just decided to go home. I was really mad. He could find a ride or crash at our friend's place (she said it would be okay because tons of people were crashing in the living room already). I went home without saying a word to him. This morning I woke up to all of these texts and calls from him *really* pissed that I ditched him at the party without a ride or without warning. He demanded to know in an accusing voice ""where I had disappeared off to,"" as if *I* was the one up to some shady shit. 

I'm just angry and confused because this is coming out of nowhere for me. We have a great relationship and have never had a fight. He tells me all the time that he's so happy we're together and that I'm the best thing that ever happened to him and that he wants to be with me forever. And now pretending I'm not his girlfriend? Claiming he's single? Flirting with other girls right in front of me? He has never done anything like that before and hasn't even looked at other girls... 

I don't drink, so is this just dumb ""drunken behavior"" that I should excuse? Should I give him a chance to explain himself or just end things now? I'm so pissed off and feel so disrespected. I can't even think of what reason he could give that would somehow make what he did okay in my eyes. But I'm willing to listen to anyone's perspective or other angles on the situation. 

**tl;dr: Went to a party with my boyfriend last night. He got tipsy and was overheard telling multiple people that he didn't have a girlfriend or that he was single, when I was right there at the same party. I left without saying a word to him. This morning he's demanding to know why. Do I confront him or just leave him?**

UPDATE: I texted him, ""You made it clear last night that you are single. I don't wait around for ex-boyfriends to give them rides home. Don't bother coming back here"" as /u/boyd1211 suggested. He immediately tried to call me and I didn't pick up. Then he texted, ""Wtf are you talking about???"" 

How could he not know? My friend (the host) even just texted me and told him she'd given him an earful all morning when he woke up for being such a dickbag to me. He denied everything and said he has no idea what she's talking about. They got into a fight about it because he stuck to his guns and claims he never said any of that stuff. I have a feeling he's going to pretend he doesn't remember or blacked out as a way to get out of this. He said he's getting a ride back to my place now. I'm considering not answering the door, but what if he really doesn't remember...? I kind of don't care, though. :/ He's coming here now, what do I do?!

UPDATE 2: He's almost here. My friend told me to talk to him ""just to hear the complete load of shit he's going to unleash on you. Dump him girl, I would""--and she's known him for longer than she's known me! I'm not going to answer the door. Thanks, all. 

**UPDATE 3**: I know most of you will be disappointed to hear this, but I decided to give him another chance.

...Just kidding. I only kid because I'm still bawling my eyes out. I did decide to answer the door and hear what he had to say, if only to try to understand his reasons behind it (not as a way to forgive him, but to fully understand why).

At first he denied it and said that none of it ever happened, and that my friend was lying to me because she was jealous of us and had always ""wanted him"" (she has a boyfriend of three years). He said he had no idea what she was talking about or why I was so mad at him. I just said, ""I heard you say it, too."" He said, ""Say what???"" But then he just saw the look on my face and crumbled.
He said that prior to us dating, he had never gotten attention from girls before and it went to his head when it happened last night. He said that he'd always felt ""in disbelief"" because he believed I was out of his league and it was pure fluke that I'd ever been interested in him. Apparently girls never approached him before we were dating, ever, so when it happened at the party he ""didn't know how to react."" (!)

He said he ""enjoyed the attention for once in his life and just went with it."" According to him he wasn't planning on doing anything but just impulsively said whatever to keep the attention coming. He swears up and down that he just enjoyed the ego boost that came from girls being interested in him, but he would never ever cheat on me. In his mind he thought it was ""harmless"" because he knew he would never let it go further than feeding his ego, and that if he'd known that I would hear, he never would have done it and risked hurting me.

At this point I started to cry, because to me it was such a STUPID reason to throw away what we had. I know some of you will say that I should forgive him (got a lot of PM's and comments saying ""it was just a dumb mistake"" and ""I say dumb shit I don't mean when I'm drunk too"") but I just can't. He broke my trust in him and, honestly, he hurt my pride. I want a guy who can handle when some other girl shows interest in him with maturity and respect... a guy who loves me so much that he would never dream of leading a girl on for attention because I feel like my attention should be enough... Someone who's proud to point at me and say ""Sorry, I'm taken and she's a great girl"" with no regrets.

I told him that I thought it was a really stupid reason to damage our relationship (being insecure and an attention-whore) and I guess it must have sunk in that I was planning to leave him. He broke down crying too and begged me to please try to forgive him because it was a stupid drunken mistake. It was so hard to stay strong, but I was very angry with him. I cried so hard because he started telling me he loved me more than anyone and he was just stupid, drunk, and inexperienced and he wished he could take it all back because it wasn't worth losing me.

I said I was glad he realized his mistake, but if he really ""loved me more than anyone"" than he really needed a better way to show it than pretending I don't exist to other pretty girls. He got hysterical and just started saying, ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I can't lose you! Please forgive me!""

I told him that I thought his actions last night were honestly pathetic and disgusting and they changed my view of him. I told him it was sad that he would throw himself after a girl and lie just to get a few minutes of attention and that I didn't think it was a good excuse to say ""that never happened to me before so I didn't know how to handle"" or ""I was just innocently enjoying the attention."" What would happen next time? How could I trust him to act appropriately and control himself? He said that ""he'd learned from this"" and he'd do better next time but honestly I just couldn't get over it. He made me feel worthless as his girlfriend and something he had to hide to get the attention of other women because my attention wasn't adequate. I know that isn't necessarily true but that's just how he made me feel. I also told him he'd lowered himself in my eyes and I didn't respect him anymore.

So I told him to get out and not talk to me anymore. I'm leaving a box of his stuff on the porch so he can get it without talking to me. Then I laid my couch and cried with my dog until I felt sick. It shouldn't feel this shitty because I'm still really mad at him. But we had an amazing year together and it sucks that something so small and stupid could cause him to jeopardize that. I don't want to be with a guy who values our relationship so little.

I feel better today. It sucks not being in a relationship anymore but I feel like I deserve better. He's been blowing up my phone saying he's been at home crying and he loves me so much. I'm just waiting for him to pick up his stuff so I can block his number.

My best friend also just broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years, so we're planning a road trip together to take our mind off things. I wasn't able to go before because I didn't want to make my boyfriend uncomfortable (go figure). But this weekend I'm going to go hang out with my bestie and swim at the beach and forget things. Thanks for the support, Reddit. You helped me stay clear-headed. I have a lot of hate and bitterness in my heart right now but I'm hoping that will pass.

tl;dr: It's over, I broke up with him. He denied everything at first but then later confessed that he did it because he enjoyed the ego boost he got and that other women had never approached him before, so he ""didn't know what to do."" I told him I don't respect him anymore even if he's sorry so things won't work.

First and foremost, I wanted to thank everyone who provided me with sound advice. I realized that my husband and his BIL were underplaying my SIL's behavior. Cutting someone's hair while they sleep may be understandable if you are a toddler who does not understand, but from a 38 year old woman???


Anyways, I spoke to my husband and told him that I was deeply hurt that he did not defend me and instead defended his sister. To me, it was not getting hair cut off, but it was the intention behind her action (being spiteful). I let him know that I refuse to ever see her again. He started calling me dramatic and saying things like ""Lucy has always been this way since she was a kid. She's just like that, don't let it get to you."" I was floored with his response and told him that he is continuing to defend her by saying that. He then got angry and said that I don't understand where he is coming from and that I have an ""outsider's"" point of view. I felt very hurt and disgusted by what I was hearing. To him it was just ""hair and it will grow back"" but to me it was ""SIL attacked me with scissors while I was sleeping"".


I told him I needed some time to process things, as I cannot be married to someone who does not have my back. I took a few days to reflect on my last year of marriage and there were many instances where my husband has thrown me under the bus when dealing with his family. He always supports his family and makes me out to be the criminal, the ""overdramatic"" one. 



At this current moment in time we have separated. My husband does not understand and said to me the other day ""now you are acting like Lucy!"" which I was astounded by. I am very certain that I will be filing for divorce.

So, lots to tell. First off, however, a few things. Before I wrote this, I didn't know what a ""red pill"" was. Now I do. I kind of wish I didn't, but a few dozen messages kind of made that happen. You know those ""debt solution"" letters you get when you're known to the county to owe money? That's how those things came in, fast and furious. Some others assumed that my throwaway having the word ""red"" in it meant that I was a sockpuppet for them. I am not. I don't think they've got a solution that isn't worse than the problem it pretends to fix.

Well, what happened? I left the house that evening for a walk (she wasn't home) and called around for lawyers. It was pretty late already and I got a lot of voice mail, but one picked up. She asked me to get mt financial statements and a lot of other things together and see her the next morning. I then decided to confront my wife that evening. 

That didn't happen. She came home very late and disappeared to take a bath almost right away. I snuck into her office and took her phone out from her purse. It had a fingerprint scanner, but her PIN was the same as she uses for the garage and our safe which she set up, so that was easy. There was nothing on the phone that I could find, pictures in Apple Photos and Google Photos were all from things we'd done together and some for her job. No messages or so, either. Just as I wanted to put the phone back, her bag buzzed. She has another phone! That one is an Android and had a pattern, so I couldn't log in. But on the screen was a message, phone number only, no name, with a ""<3"" on it.

Put that back. Decided to postpone confrontation until after lawyer, but took a photo of the message.

Next morning I talked to the lawyer and she spent about half an hour to just go over possible outcomes and what I can expect next, then another 45 minutes talking about finances and so. We don't have kids and she's the big earner, so I stand to either be just out of the relationship or be out and owed some money. It'll be months, maybe even more than a year, until all this is dealt with. Takes five minutes to marry, a year to unmarry, it seems.

I'd walked by my work and told boss and I was sick. I look like shit, from not sleeping and some crying, so that was pretty convincing. We work in food, being sick is a bad idea at that job. Went home and unplugged the Apple TV and took it to a friend who runs a small computer store. He confirmed what you'd told me, the pictures on the screen saver are from her Apple Photos. He's also the first I told and he immediately offered me to stay at his place with his wife and kids if I had to leave for a while. Then he called the number the text on my wife's other phone came from and told me a guy named ""Rob"" had answered it.

Walked home and texted her if she'd be home for dinner. She texted back, that she'd have to do some ""extra work"" and it could be late, so I told her to please make an exception and come home, I had important news. We'd been looking for a house for a while, I figured she'd think I finally found one. 

Well, dinner came and went, and she didn't show. She came home around 10, smelling of cigarettes. She was all happy and asked me what I wanted to talk about, so I asked her to sit down. I'm 99% to making something up about a house and avoid the confrontation, but then, I guess for the first time, I felt a little anger. So I told her.

I said ""I know you've been cheating for a while, now. I've been working with an attorney and we'll have to talk about these things at some point, so now is as bad a time for that as ever.""

She didn't blow up and deny it. She just... deflated and started to shake. A lot of your PMs, my attorney, and my friend, all told me not to press for details, and not put that on me as well. But I really wanted to know, so I said ""tell me about Rob."" She told me they'd met through Ann (the friend on the couch with her) and Ann wanted to have sex with him while he had a crush on my wife, so they hatched this threesome plan. That was ... 14 months ago. Apparently they've since included Rob's wife (that's the mysterious fourth person who took the pictures) who is ""polyamorous"" with that Rob guy. 

The picture thing was solved, too. She'd handed the wife her phone to take a few pictures and didn't remember the whole screen blanker thing. When she was at work, she'd uploaded them and deleted them from the phone. By then, by chance, I'd seen them. She had the second phone for precisely the reasons I thought, as one that isn't on our shared contract where I couldn't see the incoming and outgoing calls in my statement.

She also had short affairs with other women and a few men, and a most of her ""weekend work things"" were actually her and Rob going on short trips together. Through all this, it felt like she was giving me as much detail as she could in an effort to hurt me, and it worked but I think I kept a pretty good poker face.

I told her that I would leave the house, that I had photographed and cataloged everything and was hoping for an amicable separation. She simply declined, told me she'd leave and take a hotel for the time being, and put her keys on the table. She packed a few things and left. That was it. As this one guy /u/jluster says, it was like the dentist, it hurt less than I thought it would but still hurt damn much.

Today I have about 15 missed calls from her and 150+ messages, all asking me for forgiveness and if we could make it work again. I agreed to meet her next week, but only to divide our possessions. As far as I am concerned, this is over. Except for my one friend no one knows, yet, and I want to wait with making it public knowledge while I sort my stuff here and decide how I go from here. Might actually be hitting the gym, no intentions for a rebound relationship, and the rest we'll see.

Well, on Sunday I called my dad and told him about everything that happened. He was really angry I didn't tell him right away but I get it, I would be too. Mostly though he was very concerned for all of us and wanted to kill my mom's bf. He called her for her side of the story, but when he began asking about her boyfriend's behavior she cursed him out and hung up on him.

That made her find out I told him and she barged into my room screaming that I was a liar and a little cunt (yeah she called me the c-word). She accused me of wearing slutty clothes to try to steal him (the fuck?) and of loving my dad and stepmom more than her. When I denied this she slapped my face, hard, and told me she was kicking me out. She hovered over me as I threw some clothes and important stuff into a bag and then followed me still verbally abusing me into I got into my car, saying that she'd never wanted me in the first place and that she should have aborted me. I'm hurt, but whatever, she's delusional.  I'm at my dad's now and probably will be living here for the time being, my dad and stepmom have told me I'm totally welcome. 

My dad went to the house yesterday to talk to her in person about her boyfriend. He was there too and apparently the three of them got into a screaming match. He asked my siblings if they wanted to go with him and they said yes, so now they're here too. My mom tried to stop them but couldn't, and she sent my sister a long rambling text about how the three of us are dead to her and ungrateful pieces of shit. 

Since she won't talk with him to come to a solution my dad sees he has no other choice but to go to the courts to get full custody of my siblings (especially with how verbally abusive she's being). So that's good.

I'd like to start off by saying that this is embarrassing. It's embarrassing that I can't feed myself. The most I can do is stumble to the bathroom. I feel so useless. My kids are helping me with bare necessities, like water or crackers. But that's about as much as they can do, as they're little. 

Yesterday I had to pick up my kids, drive to the doctor, and pick up my prescriptions. By the time I got back I was shaking and almost didn't make it up the stairs. I had asked my fiance to at least pick up my kids. He responded ""I'm not picking up your fucking kids!""

I asked him to pick me something up from the store again, and I was met with the same response.

Maybe I'm being emotional. I don't know. I've never been this sick in my life. It's actually quite terrifying not being able to breathe. I just wish he would be a little more understanding, instead he just sighs, scoffs, and cusses at me. And on top of everything, I'm getting kind of scared that I'm going to waste away into nothing because I don't have the energy to get out of bed for more than a minute.

541,Hugbnkoplh,Non-Romantic,4nyugt,2131,"I started using drugs when I was 17. I was mostly into meth but I tried various drugs. My parents decided to help me but like most addicts I struggled and made their lives difficult. There were times that I embarrassed them in front of people, I stole from them and from the rest of the extended family. I did a lot of wrong.

When I was 23 they decided that they've wasted enough time and money on me so they cut me loose. It took me until I was 26 to get my act together and become clean. I went back to them when I was clean when they told me that they can't just take me back and forget about everything that I've done. They were right. I had to try to make things right.

So I stayed around but kept my distance from them. I started paying them back the money that I had stolen from them, and I paid that in full with interest within three years. That's everything that I stole from my parents and my sisters. I know it doesn't make it right but it's all that I could do. I kept sending them birthday cards and gifts, New Years cards, etc even though I wasn't with them at any of those events. Again, just trying to atone for the wrong I've done to them.

Years passed, nothing changed. My sisters married and didn't invite me to their weddings. I still sent them gifts. When my niece and nephew were born I also sent them gifts. When I married my wife they didn't come to my wedding even though I invited them. When my son was born they didn't come to see him or to his birthdays after that.

Two years ago my father had cancer. I reached out and asked if he wanted to see me and offered my support. They all declined. It took them until my father was really sick to reach out. He wanted to finally see me. I went to see him in the hospital with my son. He was very sick and was more or less ready to go. He told me then that he regrets keeping me away and wishes that he'd accepted me back sooner. We spent a whole day together. We were full of regrets but we made our peace in the end. He died a week later.

My mother and sister told me not to come to his funeral. That I didn't deserve to be there. It was hurtful since my father and I had made our peace but I respected their wishes. The funeral is for those who remain and they had the right to not want me around. I went but remained in far distance and only paid my respects when everyone else was gone. That moment was a big deal for me. I stopped trying to have my mother and sisters back. I stopped sending them gifts or cards or anything. I had tried for 10 years and I decided that it's time to move on.

We remained no contact for two years until this last weekend. My mother called me and asked if I can visit them alone. I went there and my mother and sisters were there. We talked a little. They told me that they're willing to put the past behind us and look towards the future, that's all we have is each other, things like that.

The thing is, I got the feeling that they need money and help. They kept mentioning how difficult things are for them, how my sisters are both divorced and single mothers without ""great"" careers and how they struggle to take care of their children. My mother said similar things. They kept mentioning how great I'm doing and how amazing is it that I was able to turn my life around. I totally felt like I was being manipulated. For years I would have done anything for them to accept me back and now they were tapping into those feelings. They never explicitly asked for money but their requests were implicit. They said things like ""family should take care of each other"".

So I need some advice. I'm hurt that the reason they want me back is for money. I loved them and tried for 10 years and received no forgiveness when they didn't need me but now that they need me, I'm loved and great? What should I do?

Fast update here...

So shout out to /u/reirarei and /u/bigb1tch. I appreciated all of your feedback but these two had the best comments, especially the latter. I put her plan into motion. Also, if you messaged me death threats and abuse, please jump off a building. Thanks. I'm not a selfish or materialistic person. I expect honesty from my future spouse; nothing more, nothing less. I haven't taken a dime from Mark. Everything nice that I have was paid for by ME. I don't need to be with him for his money, because I have my own. What I do want is consideration and thoughtfulness from my partner...not lies. If he had even gotten me something that was made from silver with my birthstone I would've accepted it because at least it came from the heart and showed thought behind it. I did not, in any way shape or form, demand a brand name ring, or any sort of ridiculously expensive ring.

Anyway.

Long story short, I finally answered Mark's calls and kept it as calm as I could. I told him I wanted to take an insurance policy out on the ring because it was very valuable and I was taking it to an appraiser. Mark immediately shut up and told me that I shouldn't do that until he got back, that he already had a warranty in place at the jeweler, that I shouldn't make big decisions without him. After he stopped spouting off reasons, I told him that it was too late, I already took the ring to a jeweler, and knew that not only was it a worthless piece of glass, but also silver plated.

The bastard stammered and the only intelligent thing that came out of his mouth was ""You took it to a real jeweler?"".  Huge fight over finances, selfishness, and lying ensued. He accused me of being a gold digger and I refuted this by asking him to try and remember that last time I EVER made him pay for anything or buy me anything. He had no answer. I said I wanted no part of something based on a lie and hung up. Switched the Facebook status from engaged to single. Oh, and changed the locks on our apartment and gave our dog to my sister to make sure he doesn't try to keep him (I paid for the dog and all his shots).

Sorry for long wall of text. I guess I just need to put it out there...

We didn't broke up right after I made my post. We had a long conversation, made effort to listen to each other and decided to stay together. We right then planned to move in back together around New Years if everything's ok between us. And everything was good for a month, really good. At the end of November I finally relaxed, we started getting really close to each other again. One night he was extremely affectionate, we fooled around a bit for the first time after three months and later I mentioned moving in. After I told him how I think it's natural next step for us, I asked what are his thoughts. In a really cold manner he held 10 min long monologue how he's good where he is and there's no real reason to move back. I was sad but calm and just accepted what he was saying despite knowing that wasn't what we agreed on. He didn't really understand why am I sad but he let it go after I pleaded him. In short, he promised he will think about it.


Then there was a week long string of his shitty behavior where all of a sudden I was guilty for every little thing. In short, the biggest thing was: I asked him, though nervously, if I can give him my house keys in the town center so I can spend morning with family that arrived for a day instead of waiting him at home til he arrives with his stuff in the early afternoon (he lost his keys to my place); he agreed moths ago that he will there with me, on that date, when my cousins arrive. He could have come over day earlier but first he said he had to work, then when he didn't he said he would rather spend the day at his place and town. It really pissed him off when I asked that... He was irritable whole week after that, acting cold and distant and refused to come to my place as agreed on multiple occasions.


Finally we agreed he will come on Friday (a week after our last talk about moving in). He called me Friday morning, I couldn't really talk so we just exchanged few words (have a nice day etc.). Few minutes later I got text how I am cold and he feels unwelcome every time he needs to come over, how I ruin everything. I responded that if he doesn't want to come or be with me, it's okay, but I am not the problem and I don't want to fight. He is welcome to come if he solves his anger. He called me again and said he had enough and said he will just come over to gather his things. I was really pissed off because this was happening all over again and after 10 of his break up threats during our conversation - I told him I am fine with it. It ended up with him calling me a 100 times that day, I guess he was in disbelief that I (!) decided to break up after a whole month together where everything was good between us. I answered every call hoping he would say the right things but he was angry because his apologies weren't enough, mocking me and saying how he has no problem finding other women, how he was willing to forgive me all my wrongs and how I should do the same for his. At this point apologies meant nothing to me and I was annoyed how easily he would like to let all (his) drama go. Every few days he continued contacting me proclaiming his love etc., claiming he would do everything for me and us and how he changed, how he will always wait for me. He calmed down after a month, I was drawn to it so began calling once a week to see how he is. In February, after 2 or 3 conversations of that type, when I asked why is he willing to wait for me but not willing to actually do something to prove his change, he coldly said if what he already did isn't enough, it can't be helped. He was playing with me all over again and it was a final confirmation for me. He still tried to contact me after, confused how I stopped reaching out but I am not calling, not texting, not answering him for two months now. I truly loved him once but was miserable with him. I am now much happier and much much calmer, filled my life with hobbies, friends and happy thoughts! I am really proud that he didn't manage to convince me to lower my standards even more and destroyed my self esteem. I am tired of drama but I have never been in better state, both emotionally and physically!

tldr He was playing with me again, hot'n cold, I broke up with him, disappointed how he really turned up to be, feeling pretty good.

Edit: 
Dear Redditors,

thank you all for your support, it means the world to me in these moments! It feels good not to be alone.


Lots of you are guessing what was it with him: for months I was trying to figure why was he doing some things and, as some of you suggested, I noticed certain things were present form the beginning of our relationship ? I was communicating back then I wasn't comfortable with it but he created a mental fog (great term!) about it,  I was more naive or understanding or just in love and accepted that change is a process that will take time. 
Those examples I provided you with are just the end of our relationship: yes, I was dismissive because I was sick of the pattern. Maybe I am not the best communicator, I see that now but I was really trying to listen. He did start dating me because I was empathic, he claimed it's my biggest quality. Later he claimed I disappointed him and that he expected more. His psychologist said he has just one problem: accepting things as they are when he excepted way more. He never had any problems he would talk to me about ? except those where I was the problem. When I would approach him with my problems or how my day went, he would be smothered by it saying I must get used to people being unprofessional and not to be bothered by it (though not always); later he would point out how he always listens to me and expected me to be grateful he put up with it. 


Also, when I broke up with him ? he moved to the city where I live in a matter of 10 days claiming that it was his wish to move there all along and how life in his hometown is hopeless ? and how it could have been with me if I haven't broke up with him (that was just 15 days after our moving in talk). He also mentioned it was part of the plan he made with his parents long time ago ? when I asked how I wasn't aware of it he responded, confused, that I have nothing to do with it and his and their living arrangement. While we were living together he would attack my choice of words for his birth home ? if I asked how was it at ?house? (in my language used the same as home), he would say how dare I use house instead of home ? when I would defend saying I didn't mean to hurt him and that I am not that conscious about my wording, he would be convinced I am doing it on purpose just to provoke him, emphasizing that his birth house will always be his home ? and he wouldn't let go easily. Usually it would last for 3 hours - 3 hours of reasoning and convincing. Some months I was just numb sitting waiting for him to stop, not even trying anymore, my mind couldn't process it.


I think he was very insecure, out of his comfort zone and trying to find a way to move away from me, he became suspicious about everything I did or said, looking for a reason to argue. I figured he didn't want to be with me. We were incompatible in many ways and in the end I just didn't want to be closed in his box together with him anymore. I want to live. Freely.



What did help me? I learned that not everyone will react to my statements / words like I am hurting them. Now I still sometimes expect the worst and I can be really anxious about what I said (even though objectively it's not a big deal) but then the other person reacts positively, acknowledging me and my thoughts ? and it's magnificent!

544,infertileoldmaid,Relationships,33e48g,2127,"I'm an absolute wreck. Countless consultations, too many tests to counts, FIVE rounds of IVF, months of crying myself to sleep. And now the only source of happiness in my life is gone.

The past year has been really difficult to me. Last July, my mother passed away and it had been her dream to see me, her only daughter, ripe with children and I'm devastated that she didn't get to experience that. To add to that, in November I was laid off and now the consequences of that have been coming to a head because husband and I can no longer afford another round of IVF, we can barely afford my appointments. My husband and I had been dreaming of the good life: two kids, a dog, and a pretty little house in the country. All of that came crashing down two days ago.

He had just arrived home from work and I greeted him with a smile and came towards him with the expectation of a kiss, and he walked right past me. When I turned around and ask him what was wrong, he looked at be somberly and told me to sit down. As I sat, I could feel my heart sinking in my chest, although I didn't know why. 

He placed a couple piece of paper on the table and slid them towards me and buried his head into his hands and let out what sounded like a quiet sob. I looked down, shaking, and saw that he was serving me divorce papers. Everything after that is a blur. I have memories of him telling me that he loved me and he was so sorry, but that he had been miserable and if I wasn't able to have a child, he couldn't stay with me. He told me that *he* was the monster and that he couldn't shake his ""biological imperative"" anymore. We'd both agreed early on that if we couldn't have children, we wouldn't adopt because we wanted biological children (please don't judge us). He used to hold me at night and tell me that he would never leave me, no matter what; that being childless was okay and I was worth it. I now know that is all a lie. I can't blame him though, because it was me who was hindering the relationship; I am the broken one. 

His sister and best friend came over yesterday to help him pack up his things and I just laid in my bed and sobbed the entire time. He has rented an apartment on the other side of town and has agreed to pay for our home for the next 4 months until I can find another job and we can sell the house. 

I'm devastated. I've not left my bed since the night he left. I haven't eaten anything. I feel like I've already died. What do I do, reddit? I haven't had the courage to tell any of my friends or family yet because I am already shamed by them for being infertile. How could he do this to me? My life is over.

545,mymomreadme,Non-Romantic,1w3q33,2128,"Hi, I found this website a few hours ago and have been determining whether or not to post my problem and after reading a few other relationship posts, decided you guys could help me!!

I am a junior in high school, I have a boyfriend who is also a junior and we have been dating for a year now. We get along so great and I have very strong feelings for him.

My mom is a single mom, has been since my dad left us when I was seven. I am an only child, I don't even have any half siblings, so I really only have a few friends and my mom. My mother and I get along well, we bicker and fight every now and then, but it's usually the normal mother-daughter squabble of ""clean this"" ""clean that"" ""why didn't you put this stuff away like I asked."" She has this kind of skew mindset that all guys are douchebags since my dad was obviously one and emotionally abused her for awhile. (Not aware of anything physical, but I was young and they had been together long before I came along.) When my boyfriend, Jared, first asked me out, she warned me against all forms of abuse and she wanted to meet him. He's a great guy and she approved and at about the four month mark, took me to get the birth control pills. She didn't exactly want me having sex, but her exact words to the doctor were, ""I can't stop her, but I can at least protect her."" Which is a totally cool way to look at it from a mom's point of view.

I don't have a lot of girlfriends I can confide in, so I confide in this journal I have. I've been using it since July 6th of last year and try to update every other day. Sometimes I just rant in it or criticize others or my day, and sometimes I write long passages evaluating myself. I don't hold back and typically just let it all out just so it's not up in my mind. I keep the diary on my bookcase between a couple of books. It's a dark leather bound journal, so it doesn't stick out unless you're looking for a unmarked spine in the bookcase.

Well earlier today, at around 8pm, I came home from the movies after a date with Jared. My mom was waiting for me, like usual, in the living room. I figured she wanted to chat me up about my date and the movie, but I noticed my journal in my hand and I immediately freaked out and asked her why she had that. She told me she was in my room putting some stuff away and noticed the journal sticking a little out from the other books. She said she was going to align it with the other books, but noticed it was an unmarked book and opened to figure out it was my journal.

My mom said she was shocked to see what she wrote. She couldn't believe I wrote so freely and ""let the hatred"" blind my usually good morals. She then went on to ask me if I was suicidal because I wrote like five or six entries about the ways of suicide and what it meant to me. I denied any of it and told her that not everything in the journal was true, there were stories I wrote in there, too, and I told her that everything in there was written at the heat of the moment. She wasn't really convinced, though, and told me she was throwing my journal out and was punishing me about everything she read about it. 

Punishments:

1. I have to break up with Jared because I wrote too graphically and over romantically about our relationship, even though I spoke nothing of sex, my mother said she was worried I was ""in love"" with him, even though I've never used those words with him or in my journal.

2. I have to see a therapist to discuss the possibility of depression for my entries about different times I was feeling blue and when I discussed suicide, no matter how hard I tried to tell her that my entries are over exaggerated because my emotions were fresh and raw when I wrote.

3. I am not allowed to get my license now for apparently ""betraying her trust"" and not talking to her about problems this serious.

I haven't broken up with Jared but I've been sent to my room and I'm grounded until my mom lifts the sentence. I have my phone but she is turning off mobile and I'm pretty sure she's confiscating my laptop tomorrow to go through all the stories I've written on my computer and to see if she can find anymore diary entries I've put on my harddrive (which there are none now, I deleted them.) I was going to get have my license in two weeks and my grandparents are giving me their old Honda Civic because they got a new car and I was so excited to have this freedom but now I won't be able to because I wrote innocent things in my journal.

Is my mom right in this? Am I just being a whiny kid who doesn't know anything, because I don't feel like I can ever trust my mom again after she breached my privacy, read my secret thoughts, and then punished me for thinking/writing them. Any input would be great and I'll try to reply or update when I have a computer or wifi.

So I called him today and broke up with him. He was pretty shocked but affirmed that nothing physical happened and he?s been faithful. I asked him to give me space and told him I needed him to find another place to stay. He said he was going to figure out the logistics but wanted to work it out. Said he loved me and I was the center of his world. I told him that his words did not match his actions. I told him I have too much self-respect to let myself be treated that way. 

Since we spoke on the phone, I have received many negative text messages. Can?t say I?m surprised. He?s revealing his immaturity. So I didn?t block him but I hid the alerts and I?m going No Contact for the rest of the day.

Hello again! It's me, the Monster in the Kitchen! (By the way, my username referred to me - I don't think she's a monster, I just felt like it was funny referring to myself as the monster - probably should've clarified that!)

Thank you so much for all your responses. I logged out and came back to an inbox swarming with support, advice, clarification, etc ... I really appreciate the time you all took to respond to my issue. Means a lot, internet strangers <3

Anyway, I'm happy to say that this is a positive update!

I definitely sympathized with her because I know it must be scary to have your only child (yes, Dan is an only child, as a lot of you guessed. How astute of you, Reddit!) ""pulled"" away by another woman, even though we have COMPLETELY different relationships. But regardless, it doesn't excuse what she did, so I let Dan initially reach out to her, to which I followed up later.

Dan gave her a call and was very nice, yet firm with her and how she treated me. Carol responded saying that she was really embarrassed and sorry and that she felt terrible and wanted to give each of us some time to cool off before reaching out. I initially told Dan that I wanted to send her an e-mail based off of what u/vanitypridelust drafted, so he told her that I would reach out when I was ready because I really wanted to frame the conversation rather than have her feel like complete crap for her outburst. So I sent her a text later in the evening and we met for breakfast this morning.

She was so apologetic and cried and I said that although it did hurt me, that I understand where she's coming from and am in no way trying to replace her. I respect her a lot because she raised my literal dream man, so even though we may not be best friends, she's done a lot of things right. We hung out for a bit, ended things wonderfully with a re-do invitation to cook dinner together this weekend - her recipes - and hugged goodbye. All is right in the world.

Thanks again for offering insight and perspective. Y'all are the best.

P.s. Dan is the best. Can't wait to lock that shit down. Any Redditors in Australia, see ya soon!

548,Espilonett,Non-Romantic,5ekt79,2126,"My sister was born with a severe intellectual disability. This caused a big strain on our family while I was growing up. At some point my parents gave up on her and decided that she just can't be helped anymore, despite the fact that doctors thought otherwise. After she turned 18 my parents tried to petition the courts to continue be her guardian but they weren't successful.

When she turned 19 I took her in with me and put her back under professional mental health care. She lived with me but spent a lot of time working with doctors, psychologists and various types of therapists to develop further. She wasn't growing to gain complete independence but that didn't mean she had no room for improvement. They helped her a lot. Last year she was able to get a simple part time job and she's held onto it until now, something our parents always believed is impossible. These past four years she's improved so much that she's a totally new person. She's still intellectually disabled and can't live independently but she's miles better than when she was with our parents, and miles happier.

This year I was able to obtain guardianship over her as that helps a lot with my involvement in her healthcare and finances. Before this, my parents always told me that I'm wasting my time with her. Now after they learned about the guardianship, they became incredibly upset and offended and they started to tell me how I stole my sister from them and I have no right to do what I'm doing and things like that. They've been trying to contact her to manipulate her I guess which I have so far blocked. This is all drama that my sister will not understand and does not need. But I suspect my parents aren't going to stop. They're some of the most stubborn people I've ever known.

So I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to deal with them without letting it affect my sister.

549,rolexpreneur,Non-Romantic,3fkk4p,2113,"So last night I had some people over to to celebrate moving into my new place. I had some family and friends, including my sister and my mother. 
When I was growing up with my sister, she would often steal from myself and other family members. Money from my mom's purse or dad's wallet. She'd sneak into my room and take things. Steal money from our grandparents, etc. We aren't very close because of this, and I always try to keep an eye on here when she's around. 
Despite this, I decided to invite my sister over because she doesn't live to far away, and I know my mom would have been upset if I didn't. I put all of my watches and valuables in my safe, but I left out the watch I had planned on wearing that night(but ended up not wearing it and leaving it on my dresser)   

At one point during the party my sister asked me where the bathroom was and I pointed down the hallway and told her the bathroom was on the left. A couple minutes later I went to go grab something from my room and saw her come out of my room as I was walking down the hall. She gave me this startled dear in the headlights look and said she was looking for the bathroom and walked away really quickly. I immediately got worried and went to do a quick look around my room. I immediately noticed the watch missing from on top of my dresser. This isn't some cheap $20 watch, I paid over 30k for it earlier this year. I left my room and went straight to my sister to confront her. I pulled her off to the side so it wouldn't cause a scene, and told her that I knew she took my watch and if she gave it back right then I wouldn't call the cops. She got extremely defensive and started yelling about how she didn't take shit from me, and how I'm an asshole etc. At this point, a lot of people were staring and listening us. She told me she was leaving and started heading toward the door. I knew if she left I might never see my watch again, so I grabbed her purse from her and dumped everything on the ground. Sure enough, there is my watch right there on the ground with the rest of the stuff from her purse. My sister screamed at me and called me a fucking asshole and scooped up most of her stuff and ran out of my place. My mom followed her out and ended up not returning to the party. 

So after an awkward rest of the party, I got a call from my mom. She was mad at ME! I got some long lecture about how I ""didn't need to humiliate my sister in front of everyone at the party"", how she couldn't help herself, and that my sister is crying and upset now because of the ""scene I caused"" She also got mad at me for going through my sister's purse and told me that I should never look in a ladies purse and that it was a complete invasion of privacy.  First of all, I tried to pull my sister off to the side. She was the one who started yelling at me and causing a scene that made everyone look over at her. I also wouldn't have had to go through her purse if she didn't STEAL FROM ME and deny it and try to leave. I'm not just going to risk losing a 30k watch because I ""shouldn't look through a ladies purse"" So now my mom wants me to not only apologize to my sister, but to tell all the guests that were there that it was a big misunderstanding and my sister didn't take anything. 

I'm really not sure what I should do about my mom. There is no way I'm going to apologize to my sister. She should be the one apologizing to me. And I'm certainly not going to lie to my how guests to get my sister out of the awkward mess she created for herself. 

I also don't know what to do about my sister. At this point I'm pretty much just done with her. I think she should be the one apologizing, but I doubt she will ever do that. 
Thanks in advance for any advice!

550,mewmiumoo,Non-Romantic,3vj0eo,2116,"Hi!

My daughter ""Lily"" is a wonderful, kind and accomplished HS student who came to me with a request back in September when the school year started.  Her friend ""Rose"" is from a very very religious, almost cultish family similar to the Duggars. Women are required to dress very modestly, stay home, have a bunch of kids, defer to their men etc. Sports, music, dance, books and pants are forbidden for girls.  Rose has 6 younger siblings that she cares for and does a large chunk of household work.  Rose's father is even employed by said church.

Rose just found out over the summer that her parents had decided not to let her go to college - by that they meant that they would not provide a single penny of financial support, not allow her to live at home if she chose to go to college (aka disown her) and most importantly, they would never give their information for FAFSA, so Rose can get grants and loans.  Of course, she would be banned from the family forever if she chose to attend college

As many of those reading this are aware, it's damn near impossible to get financial aid without FAFSA.  I work in the admissions department of the largest and highest ranked state university in my state, and Lily wanted to know if I could help Rose navigate this issue and come up with other options for her to go to college. Rose, very bravely, had decided to defy her parents and risk being disowned in order to get an education.  I agreed to help her and we have been meeting up twice a week (Rose made up a fake bible study group to stay back after hours, her mom just had a baby is quite distracted to even care) since then at my house.

I have grown quite fond of Rose- she is incredibly hard working and courageous with zero support from anyone.  I enjoy our twice weekly meetings, when I usually make dinner for the girls as well.  Rose recently confided in me that she wants to try ""sinful"" things because well, she is a teenage girl I guess. Here are the list of things she wants to try and how I feel about them.

1.  Make up - Rose wants to wear make up ( a strict no-no), especially bright lipstick.  I am ok with this because most teen girls like to experiment with make up and I don't think red lipstick will make her a whore.

2.  Tampons - Rose is forced to use thick, bulky maxi pads by her mother because Tampons will take her virginity.  Again, I am fine with this because I don't think your choice of feminine hygiene products reflect your character.

3.  A 2 piece bathing suit/bikini - This is a big one! We have a pool at home (too cold now) and she has seen Lily wearing and walking around in one when it was warmer.  Rose wants to know how it feels to wear one (she can't swim btw - her dickwad parents don't allow ANY sports).

4.  Ethnic food - Our family loves Thai, Indian, Mexican and other ""ethnic"" meals.  I used to occasionally order in when Rose was over, but she always turned down the food because she was told that these countries/cultures were ""satanic"" and their food would turn you evil or gay or whatever.  She now wants to try and explore other food.

5.   Wine - This is tricky.  Because I work in a college, I see first hand how kids from overly sheltered families go crazy with alcohol when they get to college.  My husband and I want to avoid this with Lily, so we let her have a small amount of wine with dinner 1-2 times a month. Well, Rose wants to try alcohol (also a huge no-no) with Lily.  Unfortunately, I don't want to risk giving alcohol to a minor and I plan on declining this request.

However, my husband is wary of allowing Rose these experiences in our home.  He thinks that we are explicitly undermining Rose's parents and no matter how crazy they are, it's still their right to raise Rose how they see fit until she turns 18.

I disagree with him mainly because I am already helping her defy her parents's decisions re: college (he is ok with because she will be over 18 when she moves out.

My boyfriend and I have been studying together at university, and while he is studying part time, working part time and engaging heavily in his amateur acting career. While I am studying full time and working part time. We share one subject at uni together. On top of this he is trying to pick up another hobby while looking after his grandfather who is in his final stages in a nursing home. As you can imagine, for the past 6 months he has very little time to cut out of his week to spend with me. None, in fact. I have been fine with this for the most part. I have been driving 45 minutes 3+/- times a week to get to his house so we can steal a few hours together, but he doesn't have time to spare. This is an inconvenience I can live with. 


However he has been asking me to do a lot of other things too; He has frustrated me multiple times with demands that I visit his grandfather (Who does not recognise me) for two hours, which turns in to 4.5 hours. Or help him with a family matter, which lasts 5 hours or so. Every time this happens, he promises he will drive me home, and every time he says he doesn't have time anymore and I need to catch the train home (1 hour + walking). I have spoken to him about how this is unfairly effecting me, and he seems to take it on board, but just forgets again the next time he needs something.  

After forcing me to spend $600+ on his best friends' destination wedding, the weekend before we both had two major exams due, He demands that we switch our exam times because he didn't spend enough time studying and he needed the extra day. I concede and he squanders his spare day sleeping because he ""needed it."" 

I take my classes very seriously and I feel very fucked over by his demands. I understand that family matters/best friends are important things, but he has eaten in to hours and hours of my study time, and my grades are dropping. Not only that, but it's effecting my emotional health also. I have expressed to him that it is effecting me badly, but he tells me I'm being very unsympathetic and selfish. 


What's more is that I have about $10K in savings. He recently became aware of this and has demanded that I help him pay his bills because ""we're a team"" (He is broke). I helped him with a few, but drew the line after $500 because he is very irresponsible with money and there's only so much I can pour out before it seriously effects me. He is also demanding that I give him access to my bank account because ""we are in this together"" and he wants to marry me one day so we should ""start sharing now""



I don't really know what to do. I want to be a good girlfriend and do what he needs me to do right now, but it's beginning to effect my health. Should I be giving him more money? Am I being selfish with my time and funds? At what point is it reasonable to say no?

552,Rkjampi,Non-Romantic,6anu3p,2109,"I'm from somewhere in Asia. Very traditional close families, everything is everyone's business, all of that. About 5 years ago I came to somewhere in Europe to study. The plan was to study for 3 years and come back. During this time, I had a bank account in my home country which I wasn't using. It didn't have much money in it (like equal to $30) so I had totally forgotten about it. My brother however decided to use this bank account as the base of operation for a fraud business. He was scamming people, getting money into this account, buying bitcoins with the money, etc...

Like most people who do these things, he was caught. Except that the bank account was in my name. He had covered himself well so everything was blamed on me. I ended up needing to hire a lawyer and in the end I was charged with corruption and fraud. Obviously I have not come back to face the charges and I probably can't come back to my country for a very long time, if ever.

This changed everything about my life. All my plans ruined, all my life changed, I even lost my fianc? because her family would no longer allow her to marry me after this. My grandfather died and I couldn't see him one last time or go to his funeral. Many other things...

Now about 3 years have passed and I'm still not talking to my brother. I have no plans to ever talk to him. My parents keep pressuring me to forgive him and accept money from him so that we can be a family again. My brother has offered to split the money he stole with me which I do not want. This pressure is constant and ever increasing with time, as if it's now my responsibility to forgive him just because time has passed.

It was great we were happy, we were ready, we are in a great position in our lives to have another baby. The pregnancy was fine, and we had no worries, then she had our son.

He had an enlarged heart that no one caught. I'm personally trying to cope with the fact that no one saw it. He lived for three days and passed and it was the worst experience of my life. I was holding him when he died.


My wife is an absolute mess. We made the guest bedroom into the baby's room and she goes in there and screams. I'll go home and she'll be laying there with the things we bought him and bawling. She won't go anywhere, she barely eats or speaks to anyone but me. She does go to greif counseling, but it's not helping. I did go to a session with her once, she's mad at me because I was holding him when he died. While I understand her anger, it's misplaced. Because that was incredibly hard and I'm still having nightmares about it...

Anyway, we don't know him *that* well. We've hung out maybe 4 times. My wife asked me right out if I would care if he came over when I was out of town and slept with her.  Said there was nothing wrong with cuddling with a gay man. Actually went on to say that she could have a full-on emotional relationship with someone without it being sexual (which geez kinda sounds like an emotional affair to me).

So I got weird about it.  Not sure why exactly, but I'm not comfortable with another guy in my bed with my wife when I'm not there. Gay or straight.  Perhaps it's worth mentioning that he was straight most of his life. Perhaps it isn't.

The thing that bothers me most is that she didn't say ""Ok, thank you for sharing your boundary with me. I wont push the issue.""  -- She *did* push the issue. Argued as to why I was wrong about it.

556,ZealousidealMonth,Non-Romantic,9zrlyb,2103,"For the past five years, I've volunteered for a mental health hotline. I'm deeply passionate about the hotline's work, and I've devoted huge amounts of time and energy to answering calls, training new volunteers, and fundraising. I've become close friends with many of the people I volunteer with, and I get a lot of joy out of helping people who don't have a lot of other support in their lives. I love this organization; I can't imagine my life without it.

Today, the head of the organization sent out an e-mail announcing that they've hired a new volunteer coordinator: the girl who relentlessly bullied me in high school and made my life a living hell.

I was completely blindsided. I moved across the continent after graduating from high school, and I have no idea how or when this girl moved to my city. I doubt she applied for this job to deliberately antagonize me, since we've had no contact since graduation and all volunteers are anonymous. So it's just a terrible coincidence, but it still means I'm going to have to be working with a person who was unbelievably cruel to me.

I really don't know what to do. Obviously, all of this was a long time ago, and it's possible she's cleaned up her act since high school, but I still hate the idea of even being in the same room as this girl. I've had her blocked on every platform for, wow, over a decade now. It looks like my only options are to, a) tough it out and deal with this person coming back into my life, or b) quit the hotline after five years of service.

TL;DR I've volunteered at a mental health hotline for the past five years, and they just hired a girl who bullied me in high school as the new volunteer coordinator. I definitely don't want this person in my life in any capacity, but I also don't want to quit the hotline. What can I do?

**Update (Friday, 7:43 PM EST):** Shortly after making this post, I went for my regularly scheduled afternoon shift at the hotline, and the girl just happened to be there for some kind of orientation. I wasn't expecting her to be there, so I initially just kept my head down and ignored her. A little while into the shift, she came over to introduce herself, and genuinely didn't seem to recognize me. (I've cut my hair and gotten glasses since high school, so that could have been it.) It was a very brief interaction, and I didn't say anything to her in return, just nodded and smiled. 

After she left, I asked my shift supervisor if I could speak with her privately. I followed some of the advice here - just letting her know that I have a history with this person and I'm not comfortable working with her directly. The shift supervisor was very understanding and said that she could arrange for me to only serve shifts when the girl isn't supervising. She also offered to let me schedule my shifts through her instead of through the girl, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, it seems like there will be an unavoidable level of casual interaction, given that the girl is working in the facility on a full-time, 9 to 5 basis. I think I'll be able to stick it out for now, but we'll see. The shift supervisor did ask me what I wanted to tell the girl, vis a vis an excuse for my not wanting to be on shift with her, but I couldn't think of anything to say, so I left it up to her.

Thanks for all the advice I got from you yesterday.  You'll be happy to know that my girlfriend is now my ex-girlfriend, she's gone, its over, I sent her home. I won't be seeing her again. 

First thing I did was apologise to my sister and tell her how sorry I was for having been a shit and useless brother. I should have been there for her but I failed her by giving my girlfriend more chances even after how cruel she had been.  I told her how ashamed I felt and how I had failed her as a brother, and I promised her I would never do that again. I swore to her that I'd never let put her in a situation where someone can do that to her again, I made a promise and I really do mean it this time.

She forgave me and told me how glad she had honestly really been hoping that I break up with her and send her home, but she didn't want to push me about it, and she reassured me that I am in fact a good brother, and I shouldn't be too hard on myself and call myself a shit brother.  I told her it is honestly what I am because I failed her when I should have been there for her.

I explained the entire situation to my parents and told them everything that had happened and how my girlfriend was no longer my girlfriend because of what she had done, we are now through.  I explained to them that the remaining two weeks we can all spend together as a family and I am really looking forward to that.  Both my parents supported me and told me I'd made the right decision, I told them I should have made it earlier and I failed my sister by waiting too long, but they forgave me thankfully and were understanding.

Also, some people had mentioned the shorts I had bought. You are right, I was totally sending her the wrong message by getting her something she can wear that will cover up the scars.  I told her those shorts I bought are just if she wanted to use them, but I don't think she needed them, and I don't think she should use them. I told her in my opinion she had nothing to be ashamed of from those scars, I think those scars are very beautiful and I think she is beautiful with them, she should be very proud of herself because she struggled through an immensely difficult period and overcame many hurdles throughout her life and she ended up on top of it all as a winner. I told her in my opinion she is a hero and she will always be my hero, the strongest and bravest person I've ever known.  She was really happy to hear that and so were my parents,  she said she's not feeling as bad about those scars as she was the previous days and she's ready to go to the beach again.

So I had interactions with two police forces...

The campus police who were terrible and didn't want to even let me talk during the big altercation where the neighbors reported us. They were terrible...

But the city police have been awesome and supportive and listened to me and got the ball rolling on this. I just want people to realize that there were some great police in this, not just the bad ones I had my first interaction with. 

Here's the original (a little out of order due to edits): 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42u3w5/my_girlfriend_me_21m_her_21f_together_15_yrs/

So I went to my appointment with the family law attorney who really helped me out a lot. She was able to get the security footage from the grocery store to the police who had enough evidence to book and arraign my ex on assault and battery charges. It's currently in the hands of a junior DA to see how they are going to proceed. I have a victims advocate working with me to keep me informed along the way. Also a restraining order is in place...she is not allowed to contact me in anyway or Come near me. The security footage is really bad--it shows her beating the crap out of me and me trying to get away. I don't even it remember the incident being as bad as it looked on the video. It totally shuts down her accusations of me abusing or hitting her. 

I haven't spoked to ex even once. I assume the judge spoke to her at the arraignment because apparently (im 100% no contact with her) took all the desparsging stuff about me off of her social media. I believe it's part of the restraining order that I'm not to be mentioned, tagged, etc... On social media. I don't believe she had a retraction of what she said Rather just deleted it. 

Attorney also helped me with breaking my lease with campus housing without losing any money so I'm living at my friends place which is cool but I now have to commute to school which kind of kills my schedule but I'm dealing.

I can't add much detail on the campus counselor but just say it's being dealt with by the appropriate people.

When he got home from work i sat him down and told him i was breaking up with him. I gave him back the ring. I had already started packing my things since i knew he would make everything difficult as to who would keep the apartment. He just stared at me when i was speaking and when i was finished he got *angry* because in his words i was trying to control him by threatening to leave. I made sure he knew it was not a threat and that i was leaving regardless of what he would do or say. I tried to cut the conversation there but he just kept arguing with me. He accused me of letting my jealousy destroy our relationship. Told me i was behaving like a child. I told him he should be glad he won't have to deal with the child again. 

He just kept following me around when i was getting my things to leave for the night. He went from accusing me to begging me to stay. He even said he would cut Jessica, apologized but i don't trust him anymore. I won't fall for his damage control again.

And so i'm living with my friend now. I'll contact him for the apartment later and i guess that's all.

I went to the same place she was last time, around the same time, but she wasn't there. I waited for a while, she didn't show up.

There were some other homeless guys there, I asked them if there had been anyone else around that had left recently, they said no.

I borrowed the advice of making the conversation not about myself or them, and instead discussing the possibility of soundproofing. I also decided to do it right around 6am when it was starting so I could sort of catch it in the act.

I went down to my landlord's floor and simply said, ""Hey guys, just FYI, I can hear that in my apartment as though it's happening right outside my door. I guess the walls are thin and the door is right here by the stairs. You may want to consider some kind of soundproofing for the benefit of future tenants."" (My lease runs out in a month and I'm not renewing, so didn't bother to ask for it for myself.)

I was surprised when my landlords said they had no idea I could hear it. Apparently the other building residents (both of whom have lived in my unit) didn't hear it or did but didn't say anything about it. My landlords were also very apologetic and said they were really sorry.

The next thing that happened was awesome. The 9 year old was in the room, sitting facing away and now totally silent. The mother said, ""See? Your behavior has consequences and you've disturbed our neighbors. I think you need to turn around and apologize to porkburp for waking her up."" She did not turn around (I wasn't really expecting it - she's shy around the tenants) and her body language really seemed to communicate that she was embarrassed/ashamed.

When I came home from work, I had a handwritten letter from the girl where she apologized for disturbing everyone and will try harder next time not to behave like that. (I believe every tenant got one of these.) I kind of wish her parents had made her apologize to me on the spot, but I'm okay with the letter.

This happened a couple weeks ago and so far there's been no further 6am tantrums - at least that I can hear, anyway. So I think confronting the family was a success.

Thanks to Reddit for your advice in the original thread. I also really enjoyed some of the shitposts people feel compelled to leave - they make me laugh.
   
**TL;DR: Confronted my landlord's family mid-tantrum and kindly asked for soundproofing. They made the child apologize and we haven't had any problems since. Thanks Reddit!**

**Edit** Got a few more things to say in response to these great comments:

* Thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger!
* Some people have pointed out that a 9 year old apologizing through a letter as opposed to on the spot isn't so bad considering she's 9; in fact it might be an even bigger punishment because she would have to sit and really think about each letter. That's something I didn't consider and when it's framed that way, I agree that that's sufficient.
* Some people also think my OP was about asking *whether or not* to discuss the issue with my landlord, but it was actually about *how to bring it up in the most non-offensive way possible*. As some people here have mentioned, some parents can be really sensitive to anything that seems like criticism.

I noticed I'd got almost 50% of the test creation and had 2 plannings missing from my schedule next year for every 1 for the other (6) women in my department. (There are 8 of us; my department head assigned herself nothing as she is ""managing"" and needs every prep. But that's another quibble.) I am not the newest and in fact have seniority some of these women, but I'm also not the most experienced (so it's not like ""these are struggling new teachers who need help""). So, I asked why it was divided this way. I was told, ""Well, Ms. Millie is pregnant and the rest of us have families. If you have to stay late, it's no big deal."" 

I can go to my Principal and deal with it that way; what they've done actually breaks the union contract. But I really was offended by this. I tried to explain my offense, and they literally stared at me gobsmacked. I thought I was being punked. 

I thought about posting this on r/childfree, but this isn't just a rant. I actually want to know how to discuss this with them; these are all women who I have previously gotten along with and liked. When the last one (Ms. Millie) got pregnant this year, there have been some conflicts (she is in my grade level, and they made me take on some of her work basically because she had some complications - this I did but I think PLANNING for me to do more is very different than an emergent health issue) as well as some uncomfortable situations for me (having to participate and buy stuff for her baby shower, when I'm not really into those things - but I did so to not cause waves). 

Any ideas on how to talk to them to make them see my side? Are they serious with this or just lazy? I can't even imagine this mind set. (I mean, I didn't have kids because I wanted more free time! Not to work more!) 

Edit: If it matters, I am married, with pets (3 dogs) but childfree by choice. Also, I want to point out that ""childfree"" doesn't mean I dislike children. It means I don't want to have any (some people have PMed me asking why I teach if I hate kids). 

**Edit #2 A lot of people have advised go to the union, go to the Principal, and I absolutely will if necessary. I want to be clear I'm not worried at all that I'll be ""forced"" to work this schedule, but these are my colleagues, many have been working with me 5+ years, and we have lots of meetings and times together, where it's helpful to get along, so I DO try to get along (like the baby shower thing) and be a good ""work friend"" and colleague. I just want a better way to communicate myself than I had today. I was entirely shocked and VERY indignant and just found myself unable to express myself well and I was hoping for ways to approach that someone with their attitude might understand because I can't empathize with it at all, myself (and viewing the other side is how I always try to look at problem-solving).**

Then there is my husband. He is not a ?planner? by any stretch of the imagination. His whole philosophy on life sometimes seems to be ?fuck it.? He takes dumb risks with little chance for a good outcome, but somehow....*it always works out for him!!*

I hate the attitude that is coming across in this post because I *should* be happy for my husband when he succeeds in life, I *want* to be happy for him, but when everything goes his way I find myself thinking ?I work my butt off and still come up short sometimes.......he just *shows up* and does his Charlie-thing and suddenly he?s the King of Good Luck and Fortune?!??

I guess I?ll have to give more concrete examples for the above to make any sense, though, so here ya go....

I have known what I wanted to be when I grow up since I was 12. By the time I was in high school I was already doing everything I possibly could to prepare for that career. I got the grades, I studied hard, I took the right classes and sacrificed time and energy to practice, practice, practice. I eventually got into the best training program in my area for that career, stayed up late, worked through the night and graduated after a long, grueling process. And I?m still looked on as a rookie these days who has to work under a mentor to make sure nothing gets messed up. And that?s fine, I get it.

Then there is Charlie....

Charlie, who joined the Army because he thought the humvees were cool. Charlie who?s idea of prepping for a post-military career was watching the Speed Channel and showing up to job fairs just for the free food. Charlie, who can?t seem to focus on a single goal for longer than it takes to clean his motorcycle. As the time for him to get out of the Army got closer I was constantly reminding him that *maybe* he should put together a resume, or actually spend a second or two looking at that linkedin profile the Army forced him to create. He constantly brushed it off.

In an effort to help like a good wife, I basically asked him to give me the cliff-notes version of his job and I put together a very nice, professional lokking resume for him. I suppose I was kind of hoping it would inspire him to take life a little more seriously and drop the ?whatever happens, happens? attitude.

But that didn?t happen. He randomly texted me one day that he saw a job that looked ?cool? and filled out their online application. I did my best to be supportive. Congratulations on filling out an application, I guess? When he told me what the job was I almost giggled. It was a supervisory position at a big business in an industry he had never worked in. I just kinda told him ?Well good luck babe, don?t get discouraged if this one doesn?t work out.?

Four hours later they responded to his application and asked for a resume. Fucking *minutes* later he got a call from someone wanting to set up a phone interview.

As he told me all this I asked him what the hell he had sent in, because it *couldn?t* have been his own damn resume. He explained he made a few ?changes? before sending it up. 

When I looked at it......I guess nothing was an out-and-out lie, but everything was very heavily exaggerated. Being a supervisor to a couple other soldiers meant he was ?the head of a major office?. Attending a month long course that basically everyone in the Army goes to was made out to be ?graduating from a highly selective military leadership academy?

And aside from all that, he?s never worked in this industry. *I* know as much as he does about that industry. I asked what his plan was for when they actually have him start that stupid job, and his answer was ?Eh, I?ll figure something out.?

I braced myself for the inevitable crash and burn. It never happened. He did everything wrong and he got *promoted*!! I asked him a couple months in how he was possibly getting by at work, and he told me he just kinda pretends he knows what he is talking about. He. Got. Promoted. 

He?s making almost three times what I do.

I don?t want to go tit-for-tat.....but........I fucking struggled and sacrificed and *made* myself an expert on my craft. I still fight for raises of a couple dollars an hour and have to get my work checked by a mentor before I can declare it done.

He fucking filled out an application because he was bored on his lunch break without knowing anything at all about what he was doing, now he?s the fucking boss and getting money hurled at him?!? WTF!?!?

As you can probably tell, I am maybe feeling a bit of bitterness over the whole situation. When I see him get to upgrade his car because of a job he did *nothing* to earn, I get pretty jealous.

And it sucks, because he *is* still my sweet, lovable-idiot husband. He is my best friend and I love him more than anyone else in this world. I don?t like feeling bitter towards him.

But I also can?t help but look at him going to work sometimes and thinking I did everything ?right?, he did everything ?wrong?, *why does he still get to win?!?*

Can someone please help me figure out how to release these bitter feelings without ruining my relationship? How can I feel better?

***TL;DR*** I worked hard and poured my blood, sweat, and tears into getting my job, and I?m basically bottom of the pole still. My husband just tripped and fell onto the escalator of success. I?m bitter and jealous and I dont want to be.

To recap my previous post, I was considering cancelling my wedding because of my dislike of attention, and my insecurities about my personal appearance. I loved the crafty aspect of wedding planning, and the idea of celebrating with family and friends, but my self esteem is very, very bad and I was convinced that I would look terrible and embarrass myself and my fianc? with my appearance.

Firstly, I'd like to report that I'm no longer engaged...because I went through with the wedding and got married this past weekend! It was easily the happiest day of my life and I have no regrets about having the wedding. My husband (!) was really supportive through the planning process and was very reassuring and helped me calm down when needed. 

I did hit a few snags (I DIY'd everything from the table runners, to the centrepieces to the flowers and although I pulled it off, omg was it ever stressful), but once the day got underway, I relaxed and had an amazing time.

This may go kind of against the typical r/relationships advice, but the best thing that I did was to just suck it up, and make myself do it. Basically I used the 'fake it till you make it' approach. I got an amazing dress, and got ready and had my hair and makeup done with my bridesmaids the day of. I was nervous but having them there with me (and a few glasses of champagne) really helped calm my nerves.

Once I started down the aisle and saw my husband, nothing else mattered. He thought I looked amazing and I felt amazing and it was a perfect day with our family and friends. Did I look perfect? No. Did it matter? No. I had a blast, and if I hadn't gone through with the wedding, I would have always regretted it. I know that weddings aren't for everyone, and that's ok, but I knew deep down that it was what I wanted. I'm so, so happy that I didn't let my insecurities prevent me from having an amazing day and marrying the love of my life with those I love present.

TL;DR: I swallowed my insecurities, went through with the wedding, had the best day of my life, and married my best friend :)

565,StanBurgerMan,Non-Romantic,8tnqo8,2094,"Thanks up front Reddit users for reading my long-winded background.

I've always been kind of the goat with my family, and by that I don't mean ""greatest of all time."" I mean my family always kind of looked down on me and held me to unreasonable expectations. I think it's because other than my dad, I was the only male in the house. I didn't get any special consideration for being the youngest (not that I'd want any), and anyway that was rendered irrelevant once my youngest sister was born. She was sort of the golden child throughout our childhoods, but my oldest sister also had special pride of place for being the oldest kid. I was the middle kid and even though I'm male I got hand-me-downs from my sister as long as the clothes weren't too effemimate. As an adult I can see how that's practical and moneysaving, but as a child it was embarrassing and also hurtful to see your sisters constantly get new clothes and new bikes, while I had to wear girls' clothes and ride hand-me-down girl bikes. Interestingly my younger sister never had to wear hand-me-downs from my older sister.

My mom and sisters pretty much had an easy life while my dad was alive because they just rode him all day long and henpecked him until he died fifteen years ago from a heart attack. He was only 58. Growing up sometimes my dad tried to do special guy things with me but my mom shamed him into stopping it.

I just don't get it, why my mom was always so cynical and negative toward me. My hair was always too long or ugly, I was too skinny, then when I started working out in high school suddenly I was too muscular, then I was too tanned, then too pale, my grades weren't good enough, then once I got into a good school for college, it wasn't ""that good."" When I earned my degree in business, I was a ""wannabe businessman fast food employee,"" when I got into graduate school for an MBA, it was a ""stupid idea,"" (not like I asked anyone to help me pay for it), etc. Why do you dress like that? You look dumb. Why don't you own a house? Your car is old. No one will respect you.

You know how that goes.

I worked and earned my own pocket money starting at age fifteen with a job at a fast food restaurant, so that's why they all picked on me for working fast food. Eventually I became assistant manager of the restaurant at age twenty one, when I was almost done with college.

My sisters would often mock me for working in fast food, and my mom would too. It wasn't gentle ribbing or teasing, in a loving way. No. It was spiteful insults, trying to hurt my feelings and make me feel small. Speaking of feel small, I'm really tall (6'5"") and they also made fun of me for never trying out or being good at basketball or caring about any other sports.

When my dad died he left everything to my mom, which is to be expected, including the house. He left me and each of my siblings ten thousand dollars just as some extra money, on the assumption that my mom would leave the kids everything equally upon her own death many years later. I already knew back then that my mom wouldn't leave me much, if anything, compared to my sisters. My sisters continued to live at home, but once I graduated college I moved across town to my own apartment. They weren't sad to see me go. I've been living on my own ever since. It's been going on almost twenty years now.

I grew up in a rather large house (this was Kansas, where it was possible for a normal dude like my father to own a big home), so when my sisters got married, their husbands moved in, too. Their husbands are both college educated guys but I could tell they enjoyed the idea of not having to pay for their own house or any rent. My dad had built a small guest house behind the home which he always told me would be mine when I grew up, but after he died I could tell my mom had the place earmarked for her daughter and future son in law. My older sister and husband stayed in my former room in the big house.

Well, whatever, right. I had my own thing going. These days I'm regional manager of a mid-sized restaurant chain (not fast food, but close haha) and although I'm not rich, I live quite comfortably. I could afford to put a downpayment on a house but I like the easy freedom of having an apartment. At thirty, I married my long-time girlfriend, who my mother and sisters always hated because she was Jewish and also eight years older than me. ""Your girlfriend is too old! She will never have a baby!""

Well, none of them came to my wedding even though they were invited. We actually conceived a baby but my wife miscarried. My mom and sisters found out about it and rather than express any condolences at a woman who just lost a child, my mom and sisters treated me to unsolicted ""I told you so"" and didn't send my wife so much as a card.

I love my wife, and since we don't have kids, we have French bulldogs. We live in a big bungalow apartment with a yard for them, so whatever. My family mocks me for that, too. Like I'm not a man, because I don't have kids.

It's not like I accuse my sisters' husbands of not being men because they live in their mother in law's house. Everyone does their own thing.

My wife's family is somewhat successful in the furniture business and they're a lot nicer to me than my own family. My mother and father in law offered to buy me a new car (I drive a 2000 Honda Accord which is still in mint shape) just this year but I said no thanks, and they seemed to be impressed that I didn't accept gifts.

Well, after all that background, finally my point.

It seems my sisters and their husbands have had all sorts of business schemes and tried to open their own yoga studio, because I guess my sisters are into that stuff. Sort of the whole ""Gee, I like coming to yoga class, so naturally I understand business economics and should open my own yoga studio!""

Personally I thought that the kind of boutique, expensive yoga studio they had in mind was more of a Manhattan or Beverly Hills thing and not a small town thing, but whatever it was none of my business, they never asked my advice, so I never said anything. Plus my sisters' husbands both fancied themselves business savvy (one of them sells insurance, the other works as a new accounts person at a bank) so it's not like my counsel was ever needed.

Of course they failed, and spectacularly so, and my mom foolishly put her house up as collatoral for the business. I'll admit that in a petty way I felt a bit of schadenfreude but overall I was upset especially because both of my sisters have small children (there are nine people living in my old house now).

Now the bank is threatening to take over their house if they don't come up with a certain sum of money.

It's a lot of money, but money that I happen to have, and they know it.

They all approached me with appeals (by phone message and TEXT--they've always known where I live but have NEVER once come to visit me) to how I should be a good brother and son and how ""this is what my father would have wanted"" and all that. Neither of my sisters' husbands have said a word to me about it and I doubt I'll see one penny of my money back if I ""loaned"" it to them.

My mom especially has been laying it on thick about how she's an old woman and will be cast out of her ""familial home"" and all that. She's even gone so far as to hint that my ""rich Jewish wife's family"" can pony up the dough.

I haven't yet returned any of their calls or texts yet.

I'm still thinking about how they all always have a big Christmas party every year and never invite me or my wife, partly because they don't like me, and partly because they don't like the ""Jew."" I know that if I confronted them about it they'd say ""you're family, you don't need to be invited, just show up,"" but I know DAMN WELL they don't want me there.

My wife says it's up to me whether I want to help or not, but she also says that there is power in mercy.

I don't know, though. I think she's bigger than me in that way.

I'm looking for some outside perspectives on what to do here.

Thanks for any advice, Reddit!!!

Original Tl;dr: After discussions with SO [28M] about how his lack of contribution to housework is a deal breaker, things haven't changed and it's making me [33F] miserable :-(



Firstly, I'd like to thank everyone for their replies and the few PMs I was sent. I had to leave for work not long after I posted, but I did read everything once I got off my shift and took a lot away from the post. I thought I'd give a quick update for those who are interested. 


I gave things a fair go. 


I tried a small list of chores. That didn't work - I'd find it sitting where I left it a week later and nothing done so just done it myself. 


I had him move out and stay 3 nights a week. I think he felt this got him out of cleaning up after himself since he didn't live here anymore. I found more crap lying around than before. This went on for a month. 


In the end I finished it. I gave it a go and the situation didn't improve - a deal breaker is a deal breaker, right?! 



I didn't realise being with him was affecting me so negatively that I'd be this relieved and happy after breaking up - my so-called great relationship was actually sucking the life out of me! I've since embarked on a journey of self improvement and things are going really great. 


Thanks again for all your advice!

I did end my relationship with Jim. The conversation was difficult to have, but it needed to be had. There were questions I needed to ask for my health (such as STIs and such). Though he did say he used protection, I still scheduled an appointment with my doctor for this coming weekend.


*Edit to add this part in [I overheard Jim's phone call with Derek. He told Derek what had happened and ended his relationship with them. He also said he is quitting his work tomorrow. I do feel bad but know that is purely his decision. ]


Jim will be moving back into his parent's place tomorrow. I will be canceling my lease tomorrow morning. I did contact my best friend from back home and simply explained that I will be returning home. He offered to fly up here to help me, but I said no because I know I will break down. Right now, I need to keep strong. Seeing a friend here will only allow myself to break down into a huge mess.


I'm doing my best to stay positive. I keep telling myself, ""Better now than later. Good thing it's only been just a year and not five or more. Think of this as a life lesson. Do not hold grudges and do my best to move forward."" It's hard, I admit, but continuing to tell myself those things helps me. I would love to believe that this experience has not swayed my views on relationships; rather, I would love to believe that this experience and relationship has revealed a little more of myself. I still need to do a lot of reflecting but that can come after I have done all the physical work (moving back to my home state).


Again, everything seems to be happening so fast but it's progress. Thank you all for your kind and loving support. I hope my experience and progress can be of some hope for others. I love my boyfriend extremely and though I did not mention it in the post, I did make a lot more sacrifices for him than he has ever for me. Through all that, I don't see it as losing an investment in someone but rather I am moving on for a healthier opportunity and hopefully he will be able to learn from this as well. I have no plans on getting back together with him. His words were sweet and tempting, but they were poison.


Thank you again :)

* Original Post 


Hi reddit,


I am extremely heart broken and am in need of advice and even comfort. I don't want to use real names so I will be putting in different names. Thank you for understanding.. Let me share with you all on what happened. 


I [25/f] have been dating my boyfriend [23/m] - we will call him Jim, for a year now. It was long distance at first, but I moved to his home state in August so that we can be together physically. Everything was perfect. Jim and I were extremely happy with each other, always communicated, and we were just a happy couple. 

He works at a cafe and there he befriended one of his coworkers [23/m - we will call him Derek]. Derek has been inviting Jim to get a few drinks after work, and the two became good buds. I've met him before and he was really nice. Jim thought he was a cool guy too. Then in mid-October Derek would invite my boyfriend over to his place. They'll just hang, order pizza, and drink some beers apparently (Jim would text me that he would hang out with Derek after work then come home. I never required him to text me where he was, but Jim was always sweet to text me messages throughout the day. I did the same for him too.). Throughout the entire night, Jim would tell me how he met Derek's girlfriend [24/f we will call her Karen] and that they were very nice people. I texted him back that it was awesome and sweet how the two invited him and shared a good time with him. I thought that was just that. 


So Karen and I have never seen each other. All I knew about her was that she was Derek's girlfriend, she was nice, and also I learned that she and Derek moved in together like early October. I thought that was pretty cute. That's all I knew about her. My boyfriend started to hang out at their place more often, and I would only think of it as something as coworkers/friends just hanging out after work. I do admit that I felt left out and even asked Jim if I could hang out with them. He would say it would be a hassle since then he would have to come get me from my work or at home then go to Derek's place and also that they only hang out for a short while. I just would say ""Alright"" and be done with it. 


I had a day off work and texted my boyfriend that I will come over to his work place to have lunch together. He told me that would be awesome so I went. It was pretty busy in there, but not super busy where the workers wouldn't be able to casually talk. I noticed my boyfriend working and one other girl. Between orders, this other girl would be touching Jim's arm and would smile at him. She would act really flirty with him...and my boyfriend seemed totally fine with it. It hurt because 1) he was letting another girl flirt with him and 2) he always felt bothered if I would flirt with him in public - mind you, I'm not all handsy, but I do playfully hug his arm. 


Well Jim didn't notice me in there so I just kept to myself. Until several of the customers walked out, Jim finally noticed me. We went out for lunch, but on our way out I asked him, ""Who is your coworker?"" and he told me it was Karen. I asked him if he found her attractive, and he said word for word ""Honestly, not really. She's not ugly but she's not pretty or anything."" 


I told him how I felt about him and Karen acting that way in the cafe, and he only told me it was meaningless since that's how Karen is. I tried extremely hard to just kill my jealousy, but it really hurt me. I cried in the kitchen after Jim had gone to sleep that night. 

A few days after that event, Jim would be going to Derek's place after work and would come home really late. Earlier today he told me he would be hanging out with Derek again, and with my own insecurities boiling inside me, I asked Jim to stay home with me a few times of the week because we rarely saw each other due to our work schedules. We ended up arguing, and in my anger I snapped at him saying something like, ""Fine then you can go to your little threesome."" His face went pale and just a sick feeling made me believe that what I had said out of anger was actually true. I asked him and he admitted it.

I ultimately found out that my boyfriend has been having a threesome with Derek and his girlfriend after work almost every day since October. I asked Jim if he was bi, but Jim said they were just sharing Karen and it meant nothing - it was only sex. It hurt. A lot. Jim and I shared the same views that an open relationship never could work for us, that sex with another person while in this relationship would be viewed as cheating, and so on (he was the one who set down the ground rules, and I agreed to them - we both were very monogamous). At least I thought. 

I am completely heartbroken. Jim is in the other room just sitting at his desk, and I'm in the bedroom bawling my eyes out while seeking some sort of help from reddit. Honestly, I have no friends here. The friends I have back at home didn't want me to go and we left on bitter terms. I'm ashamed to reach out to them for help. I just can't shake off this feeling of utter disgust and betrayal. I love my boyfriend so much. So very much. A pathetic part of me wants to just work on our relationship, but that is just a horrible choice. I know I should leave him and go back home or whatever.. but right now I'm just in shock.

568,,Non-Romantic,3knvuc,2069,"This is kinda long and I know that asking strangers on the internet may not be the best way of working out what to do but I really need to get this off my chest.

The first thing to say about my father is that he places a very high value on formal education.  He had very little of it himself but believes that it is the best thing that you can do in life.  I am one of a set of non-identical twins (with my sister) and she is everything that he could hope for in that she has a bachelors, a masters and has just completed law school.  Unfortunately for him (and me) I am not suited to formal education at all.  I did enroll for one semester at a state u but I knew from Day 1 I had made a mistake and left.  He was furious about that at the time and confidently predicted that I would be a bum and a loser for the rest of my life.  

However, I found my niche as an entrepreneur and after struggling along for a few years at the beginning am now doing very well.  In the same way that I knew college was not for me, I know that running my own business is.  I have started and sold a number of them over the years and, although not everything I have tried has worked out by any means, the last one I managed to sell for a decent chunk of change (low 8-figures) and have recently moved across country to NYC to find a mentor to help me play in the big leagues.  Prior to this incident I thought that my Father had come to terms with me not going to college etc and making a success of being a businessman instead.  He and I have never been on the very best of terms but I did honestly think we had managed to get to a sort of ?working relationship.?

I should add that my sister and I have always been close and although our lives have taken us in different directions we still speak at least once per month.  I always knew that she must have incurred a good amount of student loan debt over the years but I have never tried to tell her how to live her life and she has never tried to tell me how to live mine.

My sister got engaged last year to a guy she met in law school, I have met him once when they came to NYC for a visit and he seemed alright to me.  Fastforward to two weeks ago and I am travelling from NYC to our hometown for a ?meet the family? type dinner with my family and my future BIL's family (coincidentally, they come from a nearby town).  Upfront I will be very honest and say that I didn't really want to go as it is a long trip for me, I am very busy and what does it matter if I meet his family or not?  But I go, for my sister's sake.  

Anyways, just before dinner my father pulls me off to one side, tells me that sister and BIL have a combined student loan debt of nearly $500k (WTF!!) and it would be really nice if I ?did something for the family for once? and paid it off for them as a wedding gift.  Frankly, I have been expecting him to ask me to contribute to the cost of the wedding and I had already decided that I would just keep my mouth shut and pay up so long as it was less than $25k, but this really shocked me.  It was the really matter-of-fact way that he said it.  Now, I have the money and wouldn't really miss it but that was not the point.

It gets worse.  As we are sitting down and eating it transpires that he has told everyone there that I am ?rich? and I will be paying off the student loan debt.  There are toasts and heartfelt thank-yous while I am just sitting there stunned at being railroaded in the most brazen way I have ever seen!!  

Long story short, I said a few things I probably shouldn't have and end up walking out of the restaurant there and then and going back to the airport and catching a red-eye back to NY.  While I am in the air I am stewing on the whole situation but by the time I land I have calmed down and thinking ?what have I done??  However, when I switch my phone back on in the cab back to my apartment it just blows up with voice messages and texts from my parents and sister.  Later that night, my sister rings me again and this time I answer it.  I explain that it isn't about the money but the way in which it was just assumed that I would pay up.  I know that this sounds really petty now, but I was just so angry at the time.  My sister was really surprised as she knew nothing about it before the dinner and afterwards dad was going round telling everyone that I had said I was going to pay it but had now changed my mind!  She ended up being really embarrassed in front of her future in-laws (who are now wondering what their son is marrying into) so is now very pissed at our dad.

Now I come to the issue.  Turns out my sister went back and confronted our dad about it and there was a huge row and now she is talking about eloping and not having a big family wedding at all or only inviting her fiance's family etc etc.  My phone is being besieged with messages from my parents to talk to my sister and ask her forgiveness so that she will forgive them.  The final message from my father before writing this was just him ranting about how I don't deserve the money that I have and it is because of ?people like me? that college graduates are struggling.  Seems that we aren't in such a good place after all.

I am not sure what to do.  Was I totally out of line?  I don't have many friends to talk to about this and those I do have probably have as equally skewed perception on this as I do.  Did I get this totally wrong?  Should I just have paid the money?  I hate being railroaded and that is what it felt like, as though my only value there was a source of funds.  Having said that. I'd hate to think that my sister's wedding gets ruined because of me...

569,luxorio,Relationships,7chnom,2077,"He has a Vietnamese Centipede (google it) and it came with him when we got our first apartment together a few months ago. He's into exotic animals so this is his idea of a pet. I didn't mind, *as long as it never left the tank*. Now it's got out somehow.

The problem is we'd been going to have his brother, SIL and niece over to visit today. His niece is at the ""crawling everywhere"" stage. These centipedes are very aggressive and will bite if startled or not handled properly. I said he should cancel the visit until the centipede is found. Or at least warn them!

He said no it's not a big deal. What? There's a baby going to be crawling all over with a venomous centipede on the loose? He said she could provoke it into coming out of hiding, then he'd jump in and get it before it could hurt her.

This is fucking insane to me. I get he wants to find his pet, I want it found too but how is it acceptable to put a child at risk?? So I told him if he didn't tell his brother then I would and they could decide if they came. He said ""Fine whatever"" and hasn't spoken to me since that this morning. He DID go call them then, and predictably they didn't want to come. We rescheduled, but he's still annoyed at me...for taking safety seriously?

We've still kept looking for the centipede but I can feel his annoyance at me. Is there something I did wrong?

*Tl;dr* My bf's Vietnamese centipede escaped it's tank. When I told him we should cancel a visit from his family who has a young child, he didn't think it was a big deal. Ended up telling them anyway but he's irritated at me. I don't think I did anything wrong by bringing up safety concerns. What's up with his reaction?

**Edit, how things stand as of 10 pm:** Still no centipede. The apartment isn't that big (3 rooms, 1 closet) and we've checked literally everywhere, no square foot has been unturned. And yes we stripped the bed and sorted through every piece of laundry. We live in a very large and very old building, hundreds of residents. At this point we think it likely got into a crack somewhere in the wall or gone down a vent. The building isn't exactly up on its repairs.

I did calmly tell my boyfriend we needed to talk about his reaction. I told him the phrasing some of you used, that he was basicly saying ""Let's use my niece as bait and lure it out."" He hadn't seen it like that but when I said so he realized it was true. He apologized for being huffy at me, and for his astoundingly braindead idea about his niece. He said he was panicking and mad at himself for not securing the tank right, and acted defensive. Now that he's cooled off he realizes he was in the wrong. He knows he messed up, I told him if he wants an exotic pet again it MUST be a safe one. At least an escaped iguana or stick insect couldn't hurt anyone. He agreed to this.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice!!

Okay, so I want to thank everyone for all of the advice. I really appreciate it that so many people cared to give their ideas. A lot of people thought cheating, but some suggested he was just insecure.

Last night I asked him to come over. I should have mentioned in OP that the original event actually happened in mid August. When it FIRST happened after enough I said ""Listen, you're pissing me off, stop saying that I did something I didn't do"" and he just said ""Okay, sorry"". But then proceeded to occasionally bring it up since August until now. Also we are long distance, kind of. He goes to school in another state, but is from my home town. He's been here the past few days due to family issues.

So when he was over I asked him why he feels so strongly I cheated, and at first he tried to brush it off. I kept pressing him and finally he said ""I just don't feel like you could go somewhere like that with a bunch of guys and nothing would happen"". I told him ""Well, you go to Florida for most of the year for school with a bunch of girls. So are you saying that you don't think I could do it because you've done something?""

Well, he flew off the handle and FREAKED out. Started yelling that he was so pissed I'd even think to accuse him of cheating. That he never had and never will. That I KNEW about any time a girl came on to him too strong because he'd tell me about it (which is true). I just sat there and watched him and then finally asked ""Well how is it ridiculous for me to ask you that, but you think it's ridiculous that I even argue that I never cheated?"" He just said that ""He knows me"" and ""He knows what I'd do"".

Finally I just got pissed and said that if he can't trust me and thinks so lowly of me we probably shouldn't be together. He started going off then saying ""See!!! I knew you cheated!!"" I got fed up with the crazy and told him to go. He asked if I was breaking up with him, and I said no. I said no because I figured if I said yes he wouldn't leave, but I felt pretty sure that's what I wanted to do.

After he left, called up his brother who I am sometimes close to and told him the story. He was surprised by how crazy he was but also told me that my boyfriend's last girlfriend (his first) had cheated on him, so he probably just thinks that of everyone now. He told me that my boyfriend has some massive anger issues and has been known to get physical with people/objects when angry. He also told me about a bunch of other crazy things my boyfriend has done... including ""running away"" from home as a 20 year old when he didn't get his way, cussing out his mom and telling her to die when she took his brother's side over a petty argument.. etc. Some other minor things were that my boyfriend has apparently stated he ""never wants to move out of his parents"" house and continue making youtube videos for the rest of his life.

That and how stupid my boyfriend acted to me over me doing literally nothing made me decide I wanted to end it. I called up my boyfriend and told him it's over. I'm pretty sad about it, I do love him, but I don't wanna deal with crazy dick. Plus it's pretty lame we've been together three years and he still thinks he wants to live with his parents forever. I've asked him a million times what he wants to do when he's out of college. He just says ""I don't know""



   
**tl;dr**: Accused me more and more of the same thing. He didn't cheat, probably, but is crazy as hell, so we broke up.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the comments!!! Wow. I'm trying to reply to most but I AM reading everything!!

People are asking how I never noticed these red flags earlier. I KIND OF did, but wasn't sure. We were long distance, which I think often left me confused. A lot of times I'd wonder if his actions were just because we were far. Hearing his brother say those things just confirmed that's not the case.

Also a lot of you were upset I called his ex ""crazy"" and referenced her Cocaine use as an example. I actually knew her personally, she was a pathological liar as well as being actually clinically insane, and did a LOT OF Cocaine, and was like.. 15 or 16 at the time. Throwing the word crazy around was rude of me, and of course Cocaine use doesn't mean crazy. I'm a bit jaded when it comes to her because she used to be my friend but has done some pretty messed up stuff.

I was telling my friends about him, and how he wanted me to set him up with a date.  One girl was receptive and said she'd be happy to go on a date with him, she'd only met him very briefly in the past.  The only issue was that she was a bit older than him (22) but I didn't think that would matter for one date.

I took Aaron shopping, helped him pick out some nice clothes, gave him some good tips and advice.

They went on the date and from what I heard from both of them, it went really well, and they both enjoyed it.  They even have another date lined up!  Yay for everyone!

572,throwawayyapt1234,? Locked Post ?,3fb3v5,2067,"I don't know if this is the right place for this but I don't know what to do.

I live with this girl named Meredith. For someone I met online when looking for a roommate to fill the second room, she has been absolutely great to live with. We aren't the best of friends but we get along well. We both have busy lives so we usually chat for a few minutes in the evenings and on the weekends. She's actually an awesome roommate. She's quiet in the mornings and night, clean and takes good care of the common areas. When she first moved in, she asked me if she could put a lock on her bedroom door. I thought this was odd because the last roommate never did this but it's her own room so I didn't really care. She left the extra key for me in a kitchen drawer and told me she usually doesn't lock the room but if she goes away for a few days she prefers to keep the door locked because she's quite watchful of her things.

Anyway, Meredith has a good job but I don't think she is super rich or anything like that. When she first moved in, she only bought two suitcases of things. I commented on this and she basically said she likes designer items so she buys just a few high quality items but pays a lot for them. I don't really know anything about designers or labels but I kind of got to appreciate them after seeing her wear these items. 

Yesterday, I had my last exam of the summer semester and officially finished my course. I decided to have an impromptu party to celebrate at the apartment. I texted Meredith letting her know and asked if she wanted to join in and bring friends.

Me: DONE!! I am going to have ppl over to drink later. Want to join? You should ask Jen and her boyfriend to come too.


Meredith: Awesome! Congrats!! I am going to be in [place] remember? I am coming back Sunday because I have a session at 9. Have fun celebrating!


Meredith: There may be a bottle or two of wine in the fridge. I bought it last wknd. You can have it for tonight :) :)


Me: Thanks!


Meredith: By the way, if there's going to be people over, can you do me a huge favor?


Me: Ya what's up?


Meredith: When you are in the apt later, can you pls lock my room? I think I left my Tom Ford sunglasses on my bed as well so maybe you can put them in the closet or something?


Me: I am here now. 


Me: Hey, I put the sunnies in the closet and locked the room. Have fun in [place].


Meredith: Perfect, thanks! 



So people were over last night but it ended up being a much bigger party than I expected. People brought friends so it was really crowded. I got drunk pretty quickly. My friend Allie was feeling a bit ill and wanted fresh air. I am an idiot. I wish I could take this all back. I was too drunk and wasn't really thinking. Meredith's room has a nice large window where you can sit on the ledge. I unlocked her room with the spare key and let Allie in. I went back to drinking with friends. At the end of the night, a couple of people crashed in the living room but left when they were sober.

I woke up this morning to a very messy apartment with drinks spilled everywhere. I had every intention of cleaning it up. I walk towards the bathroom and notice Meredith's door open. I remember opening it last night so I just wanted to go back and lock it again. I noticed that a few of her drawers are open and her closet is open. FUCK. Now I am freaking out. Meredith literally only has ten or so hangers in her closet of which seven are EMPTY. Everything was there last night because I opened it to put the sunglasses in. The sunglasses are missing as well. I am really freaking out now. I don't know what else is missing. I looked up Tom Ford sunglasses online and they run $350+. Some of her purses are $6,000 each. I have no idea how much any of her clothes are worth. I can not afford to replace any of these items. Not now and not anytime soon in the future. I know it's all my fault. Anyone could have taken the items since so many people were in the apartment. I called Allie and she told me to file a police report which I will do now. What do I do? I have every intention of paying Meredith back but I literally can not afford to do so. I think she will be very upset about this. A lot of her things seem to be gone. It's not like she's very rich that she can just write it off like no big deal. A lot of her savings went into these items. I feel so horrible.

""The situation"" is me venting, you can skip that to get to my actual question. Thank you!

#The Situation

At first I was patient, comforted him that it?d be okay. It was good he was aware of it, don?t be so ashamed of it. I think at that point he was procrastinating with porn? I?m not sure where the line is to call it addiction? I gave tips on self-forgiveness and preventing it from getting worse. My focus was 100% on being non-judgemental and encouraging. 

I didn?t mind that he was disinterested in sex or affection. Lower libido, not related to porn, right?

It got worse. 

I started feeling really starved of affection, so I focused on that. Made a lot of advances on him all day long. Aggressive advances and just small gestures of love, like rubbing his shoulders or kissing his head. I didn?t get rejected? I didn?t even get ignored. I just didn?t get noticed. Mentioned it in couple?s counseling. It doesn?t have to be sex, but I?d like it if you reciprocate me kissing you etc. He tried. Awkwardly. The disinterest was painful to see. It was so obvious he was forcing himself.

I asked for things. Can you do this or that? Can we have shower sex? I scheduled sex together with him. Tuesday evening. Tonight. It didn?t happen. I combined the planning with seducing him - getting us out of the door for a date, dressing up in exactly what he?d like, sending naughty pictures and messages to prepare? No matter how physical the advance, like naked and rubbing oil on his genitals, it wouldn't get a rise out of him

I've bought gifts for him and left notes.

My face is not the prettiest, but goddamn I have smokin? hot body. With the combination of lucky genes and daily hard work on myself, I'm very aware of looking awesome (at least below the chin :P ).

So I?ve tried to make my own selfies and videos - I?d spent 2-3 hours daily for a few weeks to get the best possible with self recording, so he had least could show appreciation by having me on his screen for one out of ten fap sessions or I don?t know?

I remember that I?d dress up and we?d go out and he?d be so proud. Now he?s ogling every 
woman out there.

Like if he sees a woman with long dress, he needs to fap to porn of women with long dresses. If he sees a jeans ad, he needs to go fap to butts. If there?s a blond girl around, ? You get the gist.

I?ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. Not even every time? just? I want something.

I?ve encouraged more sleep and exercise, I?ve overly enthusiastically praised him for having fun with friends. He?s not depressed (yes, got checked out by a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he doesn?t want therapy anyway because he thinks everyone should fix themselves).

Eventually I outright begged him to get better (I left time between each time I asked to not overwhelm him). In person, in voice messages, in text messages. I explained how horrible I felt. 

I outright told him ""I've been feeling secondary to porn"". I'v explained exactly how I felt, how he could help by just showing some interest in me... just anything, you know?

A few days ago he said ""I still think you're attractive"" and yesterday he said ""Your selfie is nice"", but... that's all. That's all.

It?s not even about fapping, I think, he doesn?t seem horny at all if that makes sense. It?s just porn, porn, porn. He?s got things going on, a part-time job and some freelance work and he?s dropping the freelance work. He?s got plenty of friends and hobbies, so I don?t see it being a cop-out for boredom or loneliness (I think it started as procrastination and got out of hand because porn is inherently addictive?). 

I?ve begged him to find help/support. When he didn?t, I figured he didn?t know where to start, so I?ve made a document with therapy options and helplines, that he didn?t download or open. I?ve sent to porn addiction helpline to his phone so he could just tap it to call. 

#I'm giving up, what now? 

I seriously can deal with not having sex. I'm a horny woman but I'm also patient and considerate. It?s this horrible feeling of being unwanted, absolutely unwanted, by the only man I want to be desired by. Heck, even just disinterest would be easier to deal with than him actively choosing porn and pictures every single time. Everything and anything on his screen is better than me (not sure how to interpret ogling strangers?). It's crushing. I rocked this situation like a champ but the past three weeks it?s finally become too much for me. Now I feel devastated, alone, I?m crying so much.

So? I?ve tried everything. I give up. What now? I?m not ready to divorce, but I wonder if a separation would be good? Not to shake him awake, but for my sake? not being around him, not being confronted with him prioritizing porn over me or our marriage. Would that help? Because moving out would also rub it in my face how bad it has gotten. I?m also not sure what a timeline would be before divorce happens. Do I wait one year? One year till what, effort to get better or being addiction-free? 

**I want to shift my focus onto myself.** What do I do? I'm in therapy, but we're discussing work anxiety (I work from home & recently botched a big project, that's been rough on me). Note, my husband is not emotionally available to support any other aspect of my life like work, health, general concerns.

Because it's an addiction , I'm actually not mad at him. But it reached breaking point and I'm suffering. I cannot help him. How do I help myself? 

I need to stop thinking ""I can find *something* so I can help him"" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day. 

I've not been wanting to talk about it with anyone, since it's waaay too personal information about my husband, that would be a breach of trust.

I'm gonna repeat this for emphasis; I do not want to divorce yet. I will consider other drastic steps like moving out. Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. I got some donuts, lol, but that didn't make me feel better. They were yummy though!

**TL;DR** So yeah, while half of the post is about being affection-starved, my actual question is: ""What do I do for self-care, when feeling devastated that my husband isn't there for me?"". 

## Small update:

Established a two-day no contact with husband in the hopes this can recharge my batteries a little. I?m in a work crunch, so it?s not relaxing time. It should help though?

Thanks for your comments and suggestions there. They were super helpful and helped me see things a lot more clearly. Love you all.

This is a big big update and something quite shocking. I've got to go back to my therapist.

Before I get to it, a lot of you asked about my relationship with my sister. Well. There's no relationship really. I spent all of my childhood hating her and never really had a nice relationship with her. She was not like my parents but they had spoiled the hell out of her and she sort of always saw herself as the better one of the two of us. Not surprised there and right now I don't even blame her for that. On the day that I was leaving I gave her a hug and told her that maybe if we had different parents we could have really been sisters but it's not how it turned out in this life but maybe we can make up for it later ourselves. I told her that if she wants to talk to me about this she can call me and we can meet up. She never called me.

As it appeared from the last post, I went to talk to my therapist about this and she suggested that I can initiate some conversation and see how it goes. Based on her assessment she was happy if I wanted to go and see them  I just need to understand that there's no obligation to go or stay. Good.

*****************

I replied to my father's message with this:

> Hi dad
>
> For us to ever have a chance of seriously starting over, you owe me an answer. Why?
>
> I expect an honest answer. No ""why what?"", no ""come and let's talk in person"" or anything of that sort, just give it to me straight, believe me I can handle reading it if you could handle doing it. If you're not willing to give me that then I'm not willing to start over.

****************

He came back to me the next day with a long message, explaining ""why"". Let's get right to it:

He told me that him and my mom wanted a child, and only one child as they didn't have the resources and energy of having more than one. They realized that we're twins, that screwed up everything and actually made them sad rather than happy.

They decided to give one of us up for adoption. They looked around and even found a couple. In case you wondered, I was the one they decided to give away because I was smaller and my eyes weren't blue (yeah, that's how you decide which one of your kids to keep). They arranged everything, even took me to the them but that couple bailed out before signing the papers, when they saw me and my sister. Their conscience couldn't handle separating twin sisters like this. After this they looked for some couples and nobody seemed willing to adopt one of twin sisters. They entertained the idea of putting me into foster care but they couldn't live with themselves if they did.

I think that says a lot. Stranger couples, who so badly wanted to adopt a child, couldn't be heartless enough to separate twin sisters but their fucking parents wanted to do it. It's beyond me.

So they had to raise me themselves and they didn't enjoy it at all. In their minds the fact that they didn't put me into foster care was a favor in itself, more than what I apparently deserved and that's why they never cared to do more for me. Their full time and resources belonged to my sister and the small part of it that got to me, they saw it as me taking what's my sister's away. That's how they saw me. No wonder my childhood turned out the way it did.

He said that deep inside they always knew what they were doing was wrong but they could never step up and do the right thing during this 18 years. Why not? They thought that changing the dynamic would negatively affect my sister as she's now used to being offered more time and resources and I'm used to not getting it, so making it more equal would be a luxury for me and a pain for her. They thought that's not fair for my sister to be in pain for the sake of my luxury. Again, their logic. I don't even know what to say to that.

Ever since I left, mom and dad are having trouble. My sister is off to college and they're alone now with all the time in the world to think about what they did. They've been to marriage counselling and according to him that has helped them see everything clearly now and see how cruel they were to me.

He says they want to start over and make up for all of it if I'm prepared to allow them. 

****************

This is quite shocking for me. This explains a lot about why my childhood turned out the way it did. I'm going to be honest. I wished they had given me away for adoption. I really really do. I could have been with adoptive parents who really wanted me rather than with biological parents who never did. 

I still don't believe that they have changed though, this can be the result of my sister (their golden child) being away and not spending as much time with them and them trying to replace her with me. I don't want to do that at all but I don't know. I've got to talk to my therapist.

Please give me your opinions again. You guys were so useful to me last time. Your help means a lot.

It didn't get a ton of attention, but recently, I got to this bottom of this shit and it's worse than I thought. Turns out almost none of my ""friends"" are friends at all... even ones I've known since before I knew Sasha.

Our company Christmas party was in December. Sasha hadn't met a lot of my coworkers, so of course, I introduced him politely to everyone that came up to say hi to me. Most were warm, almost all were shitfaced (open bar, my husband doesn't drink however so we weren't drinking). We made our way over to the food, and one of my colleagues comes up, throws herself onto Sasha, stroking his chest, looks at me with wide eyes and goes ""OP, HE'S SO FUCKING GORGEOUS, OMG HE'S SO HOT"" over and over again. Whatever. I wasn't insulted, my husband was really nice about it, she was falling down drunk, who gives a shit.

I hear nothing else until 3 weeks ago.

Luckily, my husband just got a great job (yay!). Three weeks ago, he had to go about 3,000 miles away for a work conference. Since I was home alone, one of my colleagues I've known for 3 years calls me up and invites me out. Nice, right?

No.

We get back from our outing, she asks to come inside. I agree, she comes in for coffee. We start talking, and I mentioned I was glad that she called me up, because I was a little lonely without Sasha. The conversation goes like this:

Coworker: You just LOVE showing him off don't you?

OP: ..What? What do you mean?

Coworker: Well, me and [another coworker's wife] were talking about how you were showing him off to everyone at the Christmas party.

OP: You mean introducing him to people he doesn't know to be polite? He's my husband.

Coworker: Well, if that's what you want to call it. We were also talking about how we were surprised you were allowed to work [VIP section].

OP: I think I look great, I think I fit in well there.

Coworker: Your body looks good, but that's about it. By the way, you can kick me out any time, I know it's getting late.

OP: I'M GOING TO BED NOW.

So, basically, most of my female coworkers are a) jealous b) see my husband as some sort of man candy, not a person and c) think I am somehow not ""good enough"" for him.

I told Sasha about it when he got home. I usually am not one to get upset but this really got under my skin. He laughed about it, said he understand why it upset me (""She manipulated you and attacked you in our home, of course that is upsetting"") and concluded with ""You know in your heart, if you're a mean, nasty girl, you will end up acting like a mean nasty girl eventually"".

I went scorched Earth on all of them. Now we interact in a civil manner at work but I no longer associate with any of them beyond that.

The happy ending is, my relationship is still great, AND! we are moving the fuck out of this judgmental close minded incestuous shithole in two months.

Thanks everyone for your comments on my OP :)

Nothing too exciting happened. She got home from work and before I could even bring it up she said she's going to replace everything.

We each do our own laundry, dishes, etc, and take turns on mowing the grass.



Also, no - she didn't maliciously ruin my clothes with her pen (WTF, Reddit?). Lots of great advice in my previous thread and I'm thankful for that - lots of absolutely terrible advice as well.

We made up.

Not.

He came back home drunk at like 4AM, and I had a few things gathered together as I decided that I'm going to be staying at my parents for a while and sort things out like rent etc. Before I left for my parents he apologised in the morning at like 10AM (took the day off work because of it) , but didn't apologise for 'calling me out on my addiction.' And 'Just telling me to quit my boy habits'.

I was baffled and I asked what it is he want from this relationship (Because I was under the impression he wanted me to break up with him), and he said for me to listen to him and basically do what he says, so I told him I am listening to him, and that I didn't like what I was listening to. 

So I told him he was being sexist pig, made points of saying how often I play my PS4 and that he can use it more than me. I then rounded it up by telling him to go f*** himself and that we were done (not the most gracious thing to do, but it got the message across.)

Basically, our parents left for Korea two years ago to live closer to our grandparents who were both battling illnesses. They originally planned on staying in America until we graduated High School but due to worsening health conditions they decided to they weren't going to wait any longer. Our older sister stepped up to impress our parents but ended up taking on a little more than she could handle becoming very bitter and jealous toward us, borderline abusive especially with how much time we would spend with her husband.

We got quite a few PMs that were telling us that things could easily go from verbal abuse to physical abuse so we quickly started to look through our options which were basically move to Korea or try to live on our own.

After little bit of research we found out that in our state minors are legally able rent with a co-signature from an adult/parent and as long as the landlord agrees. We turned 17 on June 3rd which I think helped us out quite a bit. So we spoke with our parents about our situation, we made sure not to blame my sister but told my father that we thought it would be best that we moved out on our own to give our sister her life and husband back.

Our parents agreed and we started making calls and within the second day of looking we found a nice cheap single bedroom apartment within our dad's budget. We share a bed now anyways so it's not that big of a deal for us go with one bedroom. We moved pretty quickly through the process, we figured the sooner the better and there was a opening. Our dad flew back from Korea here to help us as soon as we were able to get all the paperwork set in stone. Even though he was extremely upset with my sister, we pleaded her case. And for first time went head to head with our dad a little bit because we understand our parents are cruel and many times unreasonable people and that our sister went through their mental abuse alone while we had each other. 

We must have said something right because he didn't scold her or anything like that. He thanked her for helping us in our time of need and watching over us for 2 years. Which is actually a lot coming from our dad. 

We did end up thanking our sister for everything and expressed how grateful we were to her. To our surprise she actually cried as we were leaving totally unexpected and told us if we needed anything to just give her a call. We wrote her note, which we gave to Frank to give to her later on, not to be overly dramatic but just because we didn't think we could really say everything we had to say in person. We wrote down everything we could possible think of that we wanted to say to her,  about her life, our lives, our parents, how we feel about her, and just some sympathy overall. Basically a big thank you, with some heart to heart. Hopefully one day we can meet back up with her as equals and repay her for her kindness but for now, were just going to do our own thing. We know it'll take more than 3 page note and a little praise from our father to fix our relationship with her but it's a start.

Our father has agreed to keep giving us money to live off of and for rent and told us to continue focusing on our future. His words were to not worry about part-time work and to just focus on school, high education and anything that will improve our college situation before we graduate high school.  We're taking the CCNA certification in a little under 4 weeks and then we'll work on getting any other smaller certifications as well as, 

We did speak with Frank who said we were very brave and mature for taking the initiative and noticing our sister's behavior. He apologized for being unable to prevent her actions and said that he would still check on us and that we were free to text and call him for anything at anytime.

We've been on our own for about 5 days now and so far everything is great.

Thanks for the advice.
 

**TL:DR:** We moved out into our own apartment, our dad came back and thanked my sister for supporting us for the two years and to check out our new place. We left a note with Frank to give to Lily hopefully to give her some perspective about how we actually feel in hopes that someday we can reconnect as sisters.

580,spengbab_5evr,Non-Romantic,59c90y,2049,"I hope you'll bear with me here, because I have a lot of family members. I come from a religious community that doesn't believe in the public school system and tends to have a ton of kids. 

I have an older sister ""Julia"" 27f, a step brother ""Ron"" 22m, a step sister ""Molly"" 17f, a half-brother ""Joe"" 13m, and a half-sister ""Lucy"" 11f. 

Growing up, all of us were ?homeschooled.? This involved a lot of neglect, lack of textbooks or seasonally appropriate clothes/shoes, unheated house, and sometimes physical abuse. I lived mostly with my mom, but spent weekends with my step family. Both houses were dysfunctional. My step mom used to have a severe problem with alcoholism, although she?s been better in the last few years.

Ron is my best friend and I would be lost without him. We?ve supported each other through years of hard times, and we discuss a lot how our lives could have been different if we?d been sent to school or generally had a more healthy home life. Obviously, we don?t want the same thing for our younger siblings, and don?t want to see them struggling in minimum wage jobs while trying to study for a GED the way we?re doing.

When I went to visit him recently I found that my step mom had gone out of the country for an ENTIRE WEEK and left the youngest two at the house. Ron and Molly both work (Molly hasn?t been doing any ?homeschooling? for about 2 years) and are out of the house for most of the day and night. 

I tried to help Lucy with her math homework, but she was extremely behind grade level and kept getting distracted because she had to make lunch or do chores. Joe spends all day in his room playing video games and gets no guidance from anyone. I tried to (as gently as possible) get him to do some reading, but he doesn?t understand how serious the situation is, and obviously is having too much fun to care. 

So I called CPS and reported educational neglect.

And obviously everyone knew it was me.

And Ron told me that Stepmom said I wasn?t welcome at the house anymore and to never contact any of them again.

Molly is extremely mad at me. She blocked me on Facebook and doesn?t have a cellphone where I can reach her.
Julia, who somehow heard about all this despite living across the country, also blocked me on Facebook, and reported my Facebook as impersonating a celebrity, (Facebook deleted it, generally making everything harder).

This stings even more because I?m already estranged from my biomom over my religious beliefs. I now have no family members left (besides Ron, thank bejeebus) who want anything to do with me. I feel like I make enemies everywhere I go.

Did I do the right thing? Ron has been saying for years that he ""can't"" call CPS, and I guess this is why, but at least he doesn't blame me. He suggested that I try to talk to Stepmom once some time has passed, but I would have no idea where to begin.

So we met! Thank you all for your comments, you talked me into doing it and I?m so glad I did. I made a little ""coffee?? sign as a few of you suggested and held it up after our morning wave yesterday. I didn?t put anything else on the paper because I didn?t want to look like a keener but we managed to set something up pretty easily. 


Anyways it went really well. There were just a couple things that I'm not sure about. He's suuuuuper good looking in person, he's really tall and fit and he looks so good in his uniform. We hit it off pretty well. We had coffee and lunch yesterday and we are going for lunch again today, and we've been texting a lot too. When we were walking back after lunch we walked past one of his coworkers who was like ?hey its you!? and I guess they were also telling him to contact me. He told me his Christmas sign was meant for me and when I didn?t make a sign back he just figured I wasn?t interested in talking to him but I only didn?t make one back since I didn?t know for sure it was for me. 


One of the things I wasn't sure about is his age, he's 8 years older than me. I don't think it's necessarily a deal breaker but I've never dated someone that much older because they usually want to get married and settle down right away. That brings me to the second thing, he's technically married and is in the process of divorcing and it will be finalized in a few months. Not sure how to feel about that one? he said he is very happy about it but I have to wonder what the cause for the divorce is, but that?s not something I should just come out and ask though right? Also this is stupid but he?s one of those guys who sits with his legs waaaaay apart and I?ve always thought people who do that are assholes but maybe he is an exception to that rule! He offered to come get me when my car broke down yesterday so I know he's a good guy. 


Either way he seems like a lot of fun and I?m glad I finally had the courage to reach out. Thanks reddit!

582,,Updates,2vusqf,2048,"Hello Reddit. I am the guy who submitted this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2s03z7/my_wife_33f_and_i_36m_have_been_asked_by_my_wifes/

And I know I promised an update so I'm going to give a quick one before going to bed.

I told my wife I desperately needed some time to myself so she was a complete sweetheart and watched the kids for me while I went to my favorite coffee shop and for the first four hours did nothing but drink Cappucinno's and read.

I then started to think about what to do about the problem with my nieces. It suddenly occured to me that even though they had deadbeat fathers, perhaps the paternal side of thier family coud be of assistance.

That night I got home after my wife had put all the kids to bed and told her we needed to talk.

I completely lost it and broke down sobbing. I told her I could not take her nieces. I told her how stressed I was with work, how exhausted I felt every single day doing nothing but working and being a dad. I told her she was a good wife and mom and I appreciated her having a part time job and taking care of the kids when I was at work but I was starting to resent how I had to pick up her slack and cook and clean because she wouldn't do it. I told her I was considering committing suicide because I just couldn't handle the pressure of having to fix her sister's mistakes and that I already felt like a failure as a husband and father and was sick of life.

My wife was white as a ghost. And she didn't argue or get defensive. Not once. She just gave me a big hug and started crying too and said she was so, so, sorry. She had no idea how stressed I was, how miserable, that I hid it so well.

Most shockingly she admitted she had grown lax in her housekeeping and that in retrospect she was just so tired from dealing with the kids all day and working to boot cleaning and cooking hadn't really been at the forefront of her mind, since I'd been quietly making up for her slack and not saying anything she had just let it go unchecked.

I told my wife there was no way I could take responsibility for two more children when I couldn't trust her to pull her load at the house. I said I was truy heartbroken for our nieces but that my children came first, and I could not jeopordize being a good father to them or have them lack in any facet of life because of them. I said a decision needed to be made soon and there was simply no way I could trust her to prove she would change and start helping out more and that we needed counseling because I was ready to end my life over how dreary and stressful things were. I also brought up we had no guarantees the girls wouldn't take after thier parents, particuarly her sister, as teenagers and make all our lives miserable.

She said she hadn't thought of that, and again how sorry she was and that I was right. She agreed immediately to counseling and that the dynamic of our home needed to change. That taking our nieces was out of the question when our own family needed some serious fixing. 

I could tell that my talk of suicide terrified her and she was willing to do anything to make things better. She begged me not to kill myself and then started sobbing and said she couldn't live without me, and to please not leave her and the kids.

We decided to talk about options for our nieces after getting some rest. My wife rubbed my feet until I fell asleep.

The next morning we took the kids to the park and while they were running around on the playground we discussed what to do about the girls. I brought up the girls father's families and asked if she knew any of them. She said no, but she could ask her sister for names and/or contact info.

Long story short we found out Dad A had a brother, a married sister with kids and his parents. Dad B had a married brother, two sisters, one married no kids and the other with a boyfriend and two children, and his parents as well.

My wife and I sent emails to all introducing ourselves and laying out our nieces plight. That thier maternal grandparents could no longer care for them and that we were in no position to do so and were reaching out to see if they would be willing to take the girls who would have to be put in the foster system if we couldn't find someone.

Dad A's unmarried brother and Dad B's unmarried sister with kids never responded.

Dad A's sister, Dad B's brother and parents gave us varying responses which boiled down to ""sorry but no we can't/don't want to""

Dad A's parents and Dad B's married sister without kids both gave us yes's! But here was the tricky part. They were only willing to take one child. Dad A's parents were sweet and polite but firm in saying they had no interest in raising another man's child, or dealing with potential drama from another baby daddy or baby daddy's family. Dad B's sister was also kind and said as much as she would like to, she and her husband were barely making ends meet and simply couldn't afford more than one child.

My wife and I were also in counseling at this point. We debated for awhile about whether to just take our nieces or to put them in homes where they would be loved and wanted but at the cost of splitting them up.

I'm sure many Redditor's will bash me for our final decision, but it was with our therapists suggestion we finally decided our marriage and home life was too much on the rocks and had not had enough time to heal to take on the huge responsibility of raising my SIL's children.

Another long story short we got my in laws in contact with the other set set of grandparents and Dad B's sister and they are now in the middle of adoption and custody details. But from what I've heard is that the grandparents of niece A and the Aunt and Uncle of niece B will keep in contact and arrange in person play dates and Skype sessions so the sister's can stay in contact with each other and not suffer permanent seperation. We also told them that we still very much want to be in our nieces lives and would be willing to see them and have them for a couple days a few times a month or help in any way we could.

This was a very hard decision to make for my wife and I, but ultimately we feel we made the right one for us. We are still in therapy and are doing much better.

My wife is a much bigger help around the house and bought a book of easy recipes tailored to terrible cooks like her. We also took u/zizzmoo's suggestion and started doing a bunch of crockpot meals. It's cut down on labor and cleanup TREMENDOUSLY. In therapy I made a list of chores I'd like her to have done before I get home from work to minimize my stress. The list has really helped because she can focus on one check box at a time and has a visible reminder so she doesn't forget. Also thanks to u/zizzymoo we realized we were being way too easy on the kids and gave them a chore chart as well they need to check off, with allowence on Saturday if they finished everything and didn't rush through it. Seriously, thank you so much for your post u/zizzymoo, you had a lot of really helpful suggestions, even though we didn't end up taking our nieces.

Our marriage isn't fully healed, but it's certainly recovered and I even look forward to coming home from work now.

My wife really is a saint and a sweetheart and I feel like I'm falling in love with her again.

Quick note to say the sexism and misogony on this website was absolutely insane, people, mostly men, calling my wife lazy and horrible and saying she did nothing all day and was probably having an affair. When I stated in my first post my wife was a wonderful woman I meant it. Having three kids full time and a part time job is a lot of work. She was easily distracted and tired and cleaning just stopped being a priority. Since I always stepped up to the plate to cook and clean and never communicted my feelings, she had no way of knowing I was falling apart. She readily admitted her fault in the failure of our marriage and has truly shown she is fully committed to making things right again. I was shocked at the amount of hate shown on here for my wife, and can only say there are clearly a lot of bitter and obviously single people on this site.

My wife's parent's are sadly not doing so well with the combination of cancer and losing thier grandaughters, and my wife and I are trying to be as supportive and helpful to them as possible without jeopordizing the progress we've made in our marriage.

My wife's sister is still a batshit crazy worthless excuse of a human being who actually had the gall to call my wife up and thank her for ""sorting out the problem with the kids and getting it taken care of"" and then asking if we had any money we could possibly spare to lend to her. My wife basically told her sister to go fuck herself and that unless the money was for an operation to get her tubes tied to not ever contact her again.

All in all life isn't great but it is better and I can definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel for me and my family. Thank you to all the helpful redditors who cared. The douchebags know where they can shove it.

**TL;DR Told my wife everything about wanting to commit suicide and how our marriage and my life no longer felt worth saving. She stepped up to the plate. We contacted relatives of nieces father's to see if they'd be willing to take them. The nieces are going to two different homes, but will still be in contact with each other, and we will still be a part of thier lives even though we decided not to adopt them. Wife and I still have a ways to go, but things are better and looking up.**

Happy New Year to everyone, and many many thanks for all your feedback and advice throughout this whole ordeal.

I appreciate all the people who reassured me about doing the right thing by telling Cara's parents, as it has been something that's kept me quite torn this last week. You guys were an amazing source of support in a tough situation. I never expected this to get more than a few comments, and the sheer amount of feedback has just been shocking. Again, thank you all.

One thing I'd like to expand on- A few people have wondered how Cara's parents were oblivious to the behavior. As far as facebook goes, Cara had two. She had her parents on a ""normal"" facebook that had a small friends list of relatives and a few distant people from high school. Her main facebook had her japanese name (which she never mentioned to them she had changed) and her main group of friends.

Secondly, her interactions with her parents were short. She kept to herself and stays in her room often when at home. She told them she wanted to broaden her horizons and told them working as a translator would provide a great opportunity for that. They have paid for her trips to Japan under the impression that she was going there to scope out the work scene and to make connections. 

She was careful to keep her home and social lives very separate and her parents never really had a reason to question their daughter about it.

**So this is what went down after my previous update.**

After the talk with Cara's parents, I went home and fully expected her to call, message, or even show up at my door. She never did. But, she removed her facebook profile which had her Japanese name, and a lot of information that supported her fake persona. She also deleted her tumblr, which also followed the same vein as her facebook. Everything was quiet for a good two days, and I chalked it up to her being embarassed about the situation and not wanting to talk to anyone about it.

Her mom called me yesterday to wish me a Happy New Year and to let me know what was going on. Basically, this is what happened:

Cara got home from her ski trip and her parents were waiting in the living room with print outs from her blog, fb, etc. They confronted her immediately about the profiles and the information posted on there. She tried to tell them that it was for her career in Japan and that the Japanese would be more likely to hire something with Japanese heritage. They didn't buy it and she flipped out. She began to demand to know who showed them her blog/facebook. Now, her mom *said* they didn't tell her, but Im guessing they probably did because she knows its me. Its ok, I sort of expected them to tell her since they are her parents. 

Anyway, she had begun to cry by this point and it was hard to get any answers out of her. Her parents basically laid out everything I had shown and told them, esp the part about her dad being her step-dad. They told her they could forgive some eccentric behavior, but not full on disrespect of her parents, nor the needless lying that was going on. They told her she had two options- come down to reality or leave. She has no job, and lives at home for free. Everything is funded by her parents, including expensive trips to Japan. 

She chose to stay. One of the conditions was that she had to remove social media accounts that continued to tie her to the lies. So her Japanese facebook was removed and her tumblr as well. She also had to agree to therapy. Her mom told me they were in the process of finding someone for her to see, preferably every week, so they could get to the root of the problem and begin to break the cycle of consistent lying. They are keeping an eye on her now, mostly because they are afraid she will lash out or do something rash, but honestly I think she isn't going to do anything. She is most likely really really embarrassed that she was outed and just wants everyone to forget it. I don't know how shes going to manage it, because shes going to either have to tell all her current friends the truth, or ditch them altogether.

So I wished her mom the best and we hung up. I thought that was that, but a few hours later, I get a call from an unknown number. I pick up, its her. She told me she hated me and she couldn't believe I'd do this to her. She called me a whole book of names and said she hoped someone would ruin my life as much as I'd ruined hers. Then she told me to never contact her again and to keep her name out of my mouth. I just said ok and hung up. I knew our friendship was at an end before all of this, but I cant pretend it wasn't uncomfortable to hear how bitter and angry she was towards me.


So that's it. I guess I got what I wanted out of the situation, which was for her to be faced with reality. I can only hope that therapy will help her to reconnect with her real life and to figure out whats going on underneath that whole web of lies shes spun for herself. Yes, it sucks that things had to end how they did, but i dont regret telling her parents and potentially saving her from colossally fucking up her life. 

Again, thank you to everyone whos offered their support and advice. I didnt have anyone solid to talk to about this issue and if it hadnt been for the encouragement of many people on here, I probably would have just backed out. I hope 2015 brings you all great things.

He can get downright unfriendly, and it makes me feel worse than it probably should. I come from a family that is very civil, we never yell or swear at each other. He has a tendency to swear a lot in general, and has now taken to swearing when angry or upset at me. Anyway, quite frequently he'll just be in a huff about something I did wrong and display his annoyance at how useless I am openly. It has happened multiple times that it was something I had nothing to do with at all in the first place, and when that happened he did not even apologize, but acted as though he was justified in talking to me in this way because it ""usually"" is my fault anyway.

Anyway, we live in his home country and I've been slow to learn the language, as I find myself surrounded by foreign students most of the day anyway (all our common friends are foreigners). An old friend of his came to visit, and stayed with us. I had never met said friend before, so I introduced myself. Pretty much as soon as I had finished my BF switched to his native language and started complaining about me right in front of me. He was absolutely unaware that I understand more than enough of the language to know he was talking about how ""useless I am"" (his words). I was floored at how he could do such a thing right in my face, to someone I was meeting for the first time. 

We were going to grill and have a couple of beers, and I was pretty quiet because I was hurt. I didn't want to bring it up because we had a guest, and I thought I'd bring it up when we were alone. They were speaking in their language and I got bored, so I picked up my phone and checked my email. When I went to the kitchen to grab another beer, the boyfriend followed me and confronted me with why on earth I would behave so badly and sit on my phone while we had a guest, that I was acting as though someone had died and how I was acting like a rude B-word. (also his words) He was very angry, and started shouting while I just felt trapped, I couldn't go anywhere, his friend was sitting one room over and here I was being berated while I was still hurting from the way he had acted. 

He pulled me to the bedroom and said that we were going to bed, that he didn't want to be around me like this and that if I couldn't behave there was no point in socializing. I did not want to go to bed at all, I was too upset. Nor did I want to go out into the living room and be with his friend, but I couldn't leave either. I can't remember clearly how I got out of the situation, I was too stressed, I just remember that finally I managed to convince him to go back to his friend because there was absolutely NO way I was going to lie next to him in bed while he was in such a mood. He was acting extremely cold, leaning away from touch and only talking to me to berate him. He went back to his friend once I said I'd come back later and I'd act ""okay"". I took ten minutes to compose myself and went out and acted like everything was fine and smiled and basically pretended the whole evening. 

This shook me, and I started to notice that a lot of the time he is quick to act like I've committed a deadly sin when I do something that I feel isn't bad at all. Two days after this incident, he was smoking weed and I got tired (at 5 am), so I went to sleep while he didn't want to. The next day he did not talk to me in the morning, and then sometime in the afternoon when I asked why the fuck he wasn't talking to me he said it was because I was selfish and only ever did what I wanted (because I went to bed). 

I guess my question is, how do I get out of this situation? How do I stand up for myself when I feel like he is being unfair? How do I change this dynamic, or should I just give up? 

**Edit:** Thank you for all the advice. There's been a lot of comments so I haven't been able to keep up, but I am most certainly leaving him and I am still reading the comments, as there has been a lot of good advice regarding logistics and safety measures that I will look into implementing. From the bottom of my heart, thank all of you for the concern, advice, offers of help and most of all - opening my eyes! You guys and gals are great :)

Original TLDR: my boyfriend can?t forgive me for missing his grandmother?s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?


I just wanted to first say thank you very much for all of your advice, it was really helpful, it made me feel like less of a terrible person and made me realise that my boyfriend is still mourning the loss of his grandmother. My SO and I had a long discussion the night I posted for advice on Reddit; and we agreed that we wanted to be together but that something needed to change in our relationship. We set some basic ground rules; we both agreed to start seeing separate therapists, him for his grief and troubles with his Dad and me for my lack of confidence and stress management. He again asked for space, so he moved out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom in our flat. I also booked a flight home for a few weeks to visit my own family, and I am set to leave in 4 days. 

We were making some good progress this week, enjoying time with each other, going to the park, just generally trying to reconnect. After sleeping in the spare bed for 5 days, he decided to move back into our room, and I was very happy about that. Up until 2 days ago I genuinely thought that we were going to make it through this. 


Things came to a head last night; I received my grades back from the school. I am very proud to say that I got an A on my research project, and one of my urban design proposals has also been nominated by my school for a Gold award from the RIBA. I am incredibly proud, this year was definitely the most difficult in my entire life and I did not expect to do as well as I actually did, I literally just wept when I get my results. 


I sent my SO a long message, letting him know how I did, and about the nomination, but more importantly thanking him for being there to support me through my degree. I told him I loved him, and that I was glad we were working together on our relationship. 


He came home that night fuming; he was so angry. He just yelled at me for basically an hour, about my lack of confidence in my own work, and about how I didn?t need to miss his grandmother?s funeral. He told me he hated me, and after that I sort of just numbed out. I don?t really remember much of what he said after that, I just stopped talking and listening. 


My final, end of year show is happening this week. It?s a huge celebration of the student?s work; I?ve filled an entire wall to exhibit my architectural work and my research results. During the end of year show a lot of people find jobs, so it?s important for us to be there to network and talk about our projects with people in the industry; I did this for my boyfriend last year when he exhibited his own work, I spent 6 hours at that event talking to different people about how amazing his work was. This morning he told me not to expect him to come tonight, because he needs to go to the gym. 


I?m flying home in 4 days, and I can tell that he just wants me to leave and never come back, which is what I am doing. I have stuck with all my promises that I made to him, I?ve supported him as best I could and I?ve begun seeing a therapist. He hasn?t even called his GP to get a referral to a therapist yet. He doesn?t want to fix our relationship; he just wants to keep me around to pay half of our rent and to use as a punching bag. 


So we?re over, I just paid my final half of the rent, and I?m moving back to my home country. I was originally only planning on returning for a few weeks, but with this ?Brexit? vote looking so grim I don?t really see the point in being in the UK anymore. Why return and find a job here when I will most likely be asked to leave in a year? I Like the UK, and I love my boyfriend, but it seems neither wants me so I?m going home to take care of myself. 


TLDR; Tried to use Reddit?s advice to fix my relationship, worked for just over a week.  I got my grades back and I did extremely well, my SO threw that back in my face, and is now refusing to come to my final exhibition of my work.  So we?re over, I?m moving back home, I have no plans to ever return to the UK.

587,PlaygroundDilemma,Infidelity,3rib5a,2041,"  In April of this year I went out to a pub for dinner after work. I got a little drunk and began chatting with the gentleman on the bar stool next to me. We talked about our jobs, our relationships (both divorced), where we lived etc.  He was cute, I thought we were both single, so when he invited me over I made sure I had condoms and thought nothing of it. We had fun, and I never spoke to him again.

 Cut to now, I have made a really great friend on the playground at my daughter's school. We have a good time chatting and her kids enjoying playing with my daughter. We talked about our jobs, our relationships (me divorced, her married 15 happy years), and the kids. 

On Halloween as I was walking through town with my daughter I bumped in to her, her two littles, and the husband I had yet to meet; the man I fucked in April. My mom friend registered the shock on my face and thought I was surprised at her costume, so I played it off as that, but no; I was staring down her husband who was equally as shocked to see me.

 I really do not know what to do here, and this is just fucking absurd. I have no proof other aside from the testimony of the bartender, who checked in with me before I left with him to make sure I was okay.

What exactly should I do here? Because I feel like I should tell her. I'd want to know, and I'm also sad that I know I cannot remain friends with her either way.

I ignored him again then he said ""Don't ignore my texts"" 

I texted him saying ""What? I'm Lilly""

Then he said ""I know you're Lilly.""

I said ""Ok why are you texting me this?""

He said ""because I really like you.""

I said ""ok bye""

After that he sent me 10+ text messages telling me how beautiful he thinks I am and that I look 10x better now that I had my braces removed. He was basically flirting with me

Next morning I saw them at school, I didn't say anything but he was giving me a ""I wanna fuck you"" looks... Whatever that is.

When we got separated from him to go to our classes I told Sarah about what happened. I told her ""I'm not a home wrecker and I hope you marriage works, but Austin sent me these texts"" as I searched for the messages she stopped me and said ""you passed our test. Austin and I wanted to see if you would confront me of what he did.""

It was so weird. I said ok. We went to class and the day went by quickly. We even saw him and they laughed it off.

I'm even more offended to know that they both came up with these compliments out of my own insecurities that only her is aware of.

She's the only one who knows how bad I feel about my teeth. She's the only one who knows about how insecure I am when it comes to my skin tone. And I have to admit that it lifted my self esteem to hear this from him but I still thought it was not loyal of him. 

I feel bad to know that she used my insecurities to trap me into cheating with her husband then confront me... She thinks I'm ok with it. I'm not ok at all. I may have acted ok that day but it was because I was shocked. Am I being childish?? Maybe it was just a joke and I'm taking it too seriously??

Firstly, thank you so much guys. I received so many helpful comments and messages and I'm truly very grateful. It was nice to see everyone's opinions and have some insight.

Hello. Lots of shit has happened since I wrote this post, and it's been pretty hectic. I decided to keep the gift I got him. It was two games for the PS4, and because I like gaming and I didn't have those games, I figured I'd keep them for myself. I knew taking them back would be pointless because I'd end up buying something similar anyway. So, I opened them as I was feeling way too stressed about this and played them happily. It did cheer me up a bit, and so did calling a few friends.

So, I decided to speak to him. I went over to his house and I asked him if this meant I'd not be getting presents for my birthday or Valentine's either, and he said those holidays were different. Apparently the only holiday he was against giving gifts on is Christmas. This confused me even more, as if he's against present-giving, shouldn't it be for ALL holidays and not just one? I asked him if it had to do with religious reasons and he said no, he just disliked the idea of Christmas and that was it. He had been brought up thinking it wasn't normal to give presents on Christmas.

Then, I brought up another point that was mentioned a few times in the comments. How come I wasn't an exception? I should be just a little bit important to him, I hope, and therefore he could have bought me something anyway just because I'm his girlfriend and it would have been nice to receive something. He told me he'd never make an exception for anyone because those were his beliefs and anyone who dated him would need to understand and respect that.

We argued for a LONG time, like I'm thinking we spent at least four hours just sitting in his room discussing why he was so against giving me anything. Also, why was he so alright with buying me something for my birthday and Valentine's, but not Christmas? I would understand if it was for religious reasons but he clearly stated it had nothing to do with that. He blamed it on his parents, which makes the next part even MORE INTERESTING.

His mother comes into the room, asking us to come into the living room. I knew they were leaving on the 24th for a small vacation, so I was wondering if this was a small goodbye or maybe even perhaps to scold us for yelling at each other. The house is big but I don't doubt they could have heard a little bit. And then, I was speechless. Sitting on the fucking dining table are his parents and SIX WRAPPED UP GIFTS. I look at him. Like, really? You don't celebrate giving presents on Christmas because your parents are against it, BUT THEY DO? The parents sat us down and gave each of us a gift and told us to open it now and we'd have our own small Christmas just a day before. I opened it, was a lovely gift, thanked them, etc, all while killing my boyfriend mentally. I was a little annoyed.

And then this happens. He starts grinning while I'm glaring, and takes out a gift. For me. I want to cry at this point. What the fuck is actually going on? He hands me the gift, and it's a Swarovski necklace, looking pretty expensive. He smiles, the parents leave to give us some space and I smile back, still REALLY FUCKING CONFUSED. He said it was hard to try and hide this gift while I was yelling at him earlier, but all along he HAD made an exception for me. All of it was a surprise. He doesn't believe in present-giving, but still had bought me one anyway just because he thought I deserved it. So, at this point, he still doesn't believe in giving anyone presents but he did buy me one. I was immediately really happy and hugged him. It's a lovely necklace, and I apologised over and over again for yelling. We have a really nice time and head back to the bedroom and watch tv, cuddling and having a sweet time.

He then asks for his present. I tell him I've opened them already and kept them for myself, so I'm going to need time to buy him a new one. He suddenly becomes furious. I explained he told me he wasn't going to get me something, so OBVIOUSLY I wasn't going to be giving him one if I wasn't supposed to expect anything back. He gets really mad, saying I should have kept the present for him because in the end he did get me something. But how was I supposed to know that?! He begins to scream about how I'm an ungrateful cow, and how he shouldn't have spent a penny on me. His mother comes in, tells him to calm down, and he screams at me to leave the house and he never wants to see me again. I do, and take the necklace (perhaps a bad move :p). I explained I will buy him a new gift, a better one, and still he's too angry at me to understand he only needs to wait a day.

I left and came home, REALLY FUCKING CONFUSED. I tried calling and he hasn't answered. I've been calling since I left the house three hours ago. Guys, I don't know what to do. I'm so fucking confused and today has been one hell of a day. Any advice in appreciated. I'm thinking of going back there tomorrow. I'm sorry if this wasn't written the best way, my head is all over the place. I've also spoken to my best friends and they're also confused as hell. Thanks in advance.

I?m struggling. I think termination is best, but I don?t think I can make this decision for both of us.

I felt much better after my OP, since, like you guys said, I was giving her input and not making her decision for her, so I sat my girlfriend down and told her that I didn't think we should have a child right now. I gave her my reasons why, but I, of course, reminded her that this was ultimately her decision and she had to be the one to make it. I also told my girlfriend that regardless of what she chose, I would support her.

She took a few days to think the situation over, but she eventually decided that she wanted to keep the baby. After reading up on the termination procedures, she just didn't think she could go through with it, and I completely understand. I made sure that she knew I still loved her and wasn't angry with her.

She has always been critical of my work and always considered it ""not a serious job"" and ""only a hobby"". When I was dating my now-husband, she would always advise me to get a ""real job"" and do this on the side as she argued ""I can never make enough to support myself doing this"". At some point she said ""you don't want to be a welfare queen for the rest of your life"". To her disappointment actually I've been very successful in the past few years and make more then her son does right now. 

My SIL (her daughter) has 5-year-old twins and it was their birthday a few months ago. I offered my SIL to make a large drawing of the kids for free. There was a lot of reasons for it. My husband and her sister are close and she's always been very nice and helpful to us in every way possible, and is one of our best friends. I love her and her kids so I offered this and she accepted.

MIL saw the drawing, apparently she liked it and asked me to do one of her and her husband. She gave me some instructions about the size and I told her that I will get back to her with a quote. For what she requested I usually charge around $5000-7000 so it's not a small thing. I usually offer 20% discount to friends so I was planning to give her that discount as well (I told her that she'd get 20% discount). She said ""are you going to charge me for it? I thought you'd do it for free like the one you did for [SIL]"". I told her that it's not possible as that was a birthday gift for her children. She said ""fine don't do it then you so-called artists aren't so different to gold-diggers"". I said ""welfare queen to so-called artist is an upgrade, I'm flattered"". I left then. This happened a week ago.

Today I realized that she's been badmouthing me to everyone for the past week. She is saying that she asked me for a favor and I gave her an invoice and requested payment beforehand. She is going on about how she would have moved heaven and earth for her in-laws and would have never asked for anything and that this generation have no respect and responsibility to their parents and went on and on and on. She also posted stuff on Facebook about this, although without mentioning my name.

My sister is a lesbian, and married her wife a year ago. They receive financial support from my parents (they're wealthy, and generous), have good jobs, and as such, have decided to have a baby. Currently, her wife is about six months pregnant, and the two of them are visiting for holidays. I'm in college, so I don't see them very often (yes, my parents give me financial support as well- everything is fair and square), but I'm really excited for their baby. My sister and her wife had been dating since their senior year of college, and were friends since childhood before that. I'm 7 years younger, so I was kind of left out of the loop. I never knew my sister's wife until they got married, and even then, I was swamped with my first year of college, so I didn't *really* ever get to know her. I was really excited though for this trip, since we'd get some one-on-one time together!

Our parents live about two hours away from my sister and her wife, and I flew in from across the country. We're all staying with our parents, who are not yet retired. My flight got in yesterday late at night, so I slept in. My parents went to work, my sister went to go do some shopping. My sister-in-law stayed in with me, but I didn't realize she was around until she came downstairs while I was making lunch. She's pretty obviously pregnant, and I haven't seen her since her wedding- so I was really excited to see her. She was not. I said hi, and went to hug her, and she backed away. I apologized, and she just kinda looked at me weird, and went looking through the fridge.

I tried to make small talk with her, so I asked when she was due. She gave me a really weird look, like I'd asked what her cup size was, and then just said March and kept making her food. I said I was really excited to have a niece or nephew, then asked if she wanted a boy or girl. She sighed really loudly, said she didn't care, and moved on. My sister had mentioned that her wife had PTSD due to a previous pregnancy, so I worried that might've been it. I tried to shift the subject, and asked how her work was. She set her knife down really loudly, stared at me for thirty seconds, then said ""fine"" and went into the dining room without saying anything else.

Throughout the day, I kept just trying to interact with her. Offered to get her a drink while I was in the room, she just muttered no, asked what she was watching, ""you wouldn't know it"" (it was the *Simpsons*), said I was really glad she was spending the holidays with us, a very begrudging ""yeah."" Really, I thought this must just be how she is. Then, my parents and sister came home, and she was super cheery and nice to them. My dad was asking if they had names picked out, and she just wouldn't stop chattering on. My sister said she wanted a family name, and her wife insisted on a unique name. My mom pointed out that my name (Anais) isn't very common, but it's also a family name (same as my grandmother), and they should consider it. I said I wouldn't mind having a niece with my same name, and my sister was really enthusiastic about it. Her wife gave me a death glare.

I just ended up getting the silent treatment! At dinner, I asked if she would pass the potatoes, and she didn't listen. I repeated myself, she ignored me, and then my sister told her I had asked for her to pass the potatoes. Suddenly, she was all bubbly and giggling ""guess I didn't hear!""

What do I do? Should I tell my sister? Directly challenge her? I have very positive relationships with my parents and my sister, and I want to be really involved with my niece/nephew, so I really don't want to go 100% no contact or anything. How can I try to resolve or at least get over this?

TLDR: My sister's pregnant wife is weirdly cold and kind of short with me. What to do?

UPDATE (as of this morning): So, we all had breakfast together. I sat across from my sister, between my parents, with my SIL kitty corner to me. My SIL actually SPOKE TO ME!! But it wasn't all that positive. She asked if I was seeing anyone, in kind of a snarky tone. I said no, school was really busy, I just didn't have time, etc. She responded, ""Well, not everyone finds someone."" My sister tried changing the subject, asking my parents whether or not they'd gone to their winter home yet (they're those rich people). My SIL was *so* nice to them. She was saying what a gorgeous house it is, how grateful she was to have been able to take a vacation there with my sister last month. My mom is easily flattered, so once my SIL got started, she started gushing about her, and it was just a mush fest.

After breakfast, I offered to go take our dogs for a walk. When I came back, my parents had left with my sister to go shopping again, and my SIL was the only one home. She asked me how I was liking college, and I said I was liking it a lot. I major in pre-dental, started talking about it a bit, and she rolled her eyes. I apologized for oversharing, and she said, ""No. It's fine. You just have a problem with reading the room, I guess."" Then, she walked away. When my sister comes home, I'm definitely going to tell her about it.",1513391172.0,"My [19F] pregnant SIL [26F] is cold and short with me, but kind to everyone else",0.99
595,notsomatchofeline,Updates,5ocx3z,2034,"Today, I happened to stumble across this throwaway. Furthermore, I noticed that it happened to be the throwaway's cakeday so I think *someone* is prodding me to do an update on this!

I posted a year ago about how my wife had [given up alcohol for good and how I was finding it hard to deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40im59/my_wife_30_f_has_given_up_alcohol_for_good_and_i/).

I'd like to thank everyone that commented on the original thread. I did read everything even if I didn't reply to everyone. There were people who thought (as I expected) that I was selfish, that it shouldn't matter that my wife was making that decision and that I likely had my own hidden drinking problems. There were others, though, that understood and could see my point of view.

The TL/DR of my original post is that my wife had decided to give up alcohol for good, had told me she thought she was an alcoholic and so was going to quit. She was not an alcoholic in the 'traditional' sense i.e. she didn't get drunk all the time, wouldn't drink in the day but she did have two or three glasses of wine pretty much every evening after work. A lot of people do that. When she told me she was quitting booze for good, it was a complete shock to me and I felt a very real sense of loss. I really felt heartbroken because I felt like there would be things we would 'miss out' on in the future together - sharing cocktails by the pool on holiday, sharing a bottle of nice wine over a romantic candlelit dinner, popping a bottle of champagne on New Year's, toasting to our (currently non existent) children on their wedding days. I felt like that had all been taken away from me. I knew that this was small fry compared to what others went through and what she could be going through but that didn't stop it hurting. Everyone's problems matters to *them* even if an abstract observer can clearly see that one person's problems are much worse than anothers'.

When I googled for help and advice on the matter, nothing really came up so I want to keep my original post up and supply an update to let others that might go through the same thing that they're not alone.

As I mentioned above, some people were adament that my wife's decision to not drink ever again shouldn't affect me in the slightest. Basically, it had nothing to do with me and if I felt like it affected me then I had my own problems. A year on, I can defiantly tell those people that they are wrong. In a marriage, at least in the kind of marriage I believe in, you and your partner's actions and choices are intertwined. The whole point of a marriage is to *share* the rest of your lives together. I had expected and hoped for a long future together, sharing experiences that typically included alcohol. Our society, as a whole, is intertwined with booze. We first met when we were both tipsy at a student bar, pretty much all the social occasions we've ever been to have involved some alcohol - that's just where our society is. Drinking was, in some ways, a 'shared interest'. If you met a partner through rock climbing and you climbed together several times a week, got married, carried on climbing together all the time then suddenly your married partner said ""sorry, I'm never going to climb again"", you would feel hurt. Like something core to your relationship had been taken away.

So, what have I learnt in the past year? Well for one, your parter giving up booze really doesn't matter. You just adjust. I'd be lying if there were times that I miss us sharing a bottle of wine together but those thoughts are few and far between. It's far more important to me that she's happy and feels much better about herself. She's healthier, has a better outlook on life and when we are out togheter, we actually spend more 'quality' time together. I've never been a big drinker so if we were out, she'd get tipsier way before me so in a way, we weren't on the same conversation level by the end of the night. Now, we can talk 'properly' throughout. There are lots of benefits too, we spend much less on drinks now, of course - especially at home. We do, however, spend more on food. That's something I get more enjoyment from anyway though.

We've been on holiday, we've been to weddings, we've been out to loads of dinners, we've had Christmas together. It's all been fine. I always knew it would be - other people don't really judge much once you just say 'you don't drink'. As long as you don't make a big deal about it. My wife still doesn't tell people that she's an alcoholic; the story is still ""I gave up for dry January and found myself really liking it and felt better about myself so I gave it up for good"". It's just easier, makes less of an issue of it and draws much less attention. We're probably happier than we were before (although we were plenty happy then too). I love my wife and I love spending time with her.

For what it's worth, I do still drink. I didn't drink much before she gave up and now I do drink less. I'd share a bottle on nights out before but hardly ever drank at home. I'd say I had, on average, 2-3 units a week. Now I'm more at 0.5-1 units. I.e. Once every two or three weeks I might have a couple of beers. I hardly ever drink when we're out together. Only if I *really* fancy it. When I just 'quite fancy' it, I'd usually choose not to out of solidarity with my wife.

One change I have noticed is that I judge the shit out of restaurants that have a crappy soft drinks selection or lack of non-alcoholic cocktails. High end restaurants tend to have several great options and will go out of their way to cater to you. Other restaurants do seem to judge you for not getting a bottle of wine, likely because they make a healthy profit off of alchohol. Annoyingly, we're not doing it because we want to be 'cheap', we'd happily pay for an overpriced mocktail that's basically just tonic water with a cucumber in. I do enjoy being 'prepared' for my wife now though - i.e. if we're at a function where they're handing out champagne and nothing else, I will do what I can to get her something else; I'll happily be a bit of an arsehole if a place hasn't thought about providing non alcoholic drinks. There are plenty of people that can't drink for a number of reasons after all - religion, health pregnancy etc. Places really should be prepared.

I've rambled on for a while here, it's a bit disjointed as I wasn't planning on spending loads of my day writing about this! I'll happily answer any questions others may have. What with it being 'Dry January' for a lot of people, this could be something others might be thinking about.

I'd like to thank a few people from the original post for their comments; /u/gravityline and /u/Spectrum2081 for making me realise that it could have been a *lot* worse, she could have opted to go vegan instead which would have been bloody *awful*. u/lofwt and u/ShelfLifeInc for their points of view as non/little drinkers and for giving substitute suggestions. Also u/gooberfaced for saying that our life probably lacked any 'real' problems. That really made me laugh and see the truth in it!! There are many more that commented and helped in my original post but I can't list them all. Oh, also a shout out to r/stopdrinking; I got my wife to sign up to reddit for that sub and she's found it really helpful several times over the past year. :)

TL/DR: My wife decided a year ago that she was quitting alcohol for good as she felt she was an alchoholic. This was a shock for me, I didn't think she was and I felt feelings of loss at the thought of a future where we wouldn't drink occasionally togehter. A year on, everything's been fine, we're happier, she's healthier and still doesn't drink. It hasn't been a big deal. I still feel some feelings of loss but they're so insignificant now and I realise that.

596,nomorephotos2016,Relationships,4q9fln,2036,"This story begins with my ex, Rick and I. My family and his family are friends and he and I have been close friends since we were children, we attended the same high school and dated from 2007 to 2014. Ultimately our relationship felt like it had run it's course and we split amicably, however having many, many similar friends due to attending the same high school and university, we saw each other quite often even after our break up. Because we share such a large and similar friend group, we have many photos together of not just us alone but with all our friends and even with family. Many of those photos are captured moments of treasured memories that make up a large part of my not so long life.

My bf, Adrian and I have been together for 14 months, we don't live together but I do visit him at his place and spend nights there. Anyway a couple months ago he borrowed my laptop to fix something for me, when I got it back, that was it, I'm not someone who combs my photos often, in fact the last time I did update the photos on my laptop must have been February. I randomly felt like going through them this past weekend though and found that there were a lot of photos missing, there are photos of my ex and I alone scattered here and there but most of them are friends/family photos with many people, which happened to include my ex.


I had probably 3500+ photos and I'm down to maybe 1300 now, over two thousand photos taken over many years, mostly by me are now gone. I understand this is partly my fault because not all the photos were backed up elsewhere, maybe 300 or 400 can be recovered, at best. Naturally I called him to ask what happened to my photos because he was the only other person to have the laptop within the last few months. He said that while fixing my laptop, he found a lot of those photos and was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those. I got pretty angry because those photos weren't just about my ex, they were about everyone over a decent chunk of my life and all the memories of fun events and even random mundane times in my life. Yes my ex is in a LOT of them but we've known each other forever and our families are very close, we'd been together for 1/3 of our lives when we broke up and still saw each other a lot after things ended so obviously he'd be in a lot of those photos. It's not like I saw him in a group photo of 11+ people and would start pining or anything. I told him if he didn't like it he should have approached me and discussed it, not acted without thinking and deleted my photos. Especially since the majority of 'couple' pics of my ex and I are gone. 


He says he understands why I'm angry and he did overreact when he deleted the photos but he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this and I do love him but I don't know how to just move past this. He says the photos are in the past and our relationship should be more valuable to me as it's in the 'here and now' as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago.

I should note that he and my ex do see each other from time to time, at family gatherings and I'm friends with his **(Rick's)** cousins and sisters and he's **(Rick)** friends with some of my guy cousins and when we **(Adrian and I)** do hang out in a group with my friends, sometimes my ex is there because well, yeah, we share many similar friends. It's not like we interact a lot or anything but he admitted that since we've been together he's always felt like a large portion of our friends and family don't really like him because they're very fond of my ex. So he's felt insecure for some time and acted without thinking. I told him that my family really likes him and my friends like him as well plus they have known my ex forever so it's natural they may have more affection for him but even so, if he felt that way, he should have discussed it with me.

TL;DR Bf deleted over 2000 photos because my ex was in a lot of them, these photos included friends, family and are from times that are some of my fondest memories, doesn't think I should be angry because our relationship is in the 'here and now' and that's the past",1467120707.0,"Bf (25M) deleted a lot of my (23F) favorite photos because my ex was in them, doesn't think I should be as furious as I am",0.94
597,pleasejustgoaway00,Personal issues,70qejf,2028,"This began the first week of school, so about 4 weeks ago. I have two evening classes on Tuesdays and my teacher told us we would likely get out after an hour and a half so we definitely would not be there the full three hours. I share a car with my mom and so on Tuesdays, she drives with me to school, I hand it off to her, and she comes to pick me up. 

That evening, since it was the first day, I got out much earlier and figured I would sit in the lobby and read for a bit while I waited. I was the only one in the lobby at that point and it was around 8:30 PM. I hear someone say ""Hi."" but I just kept reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a tall man in sweats carrying a gym back a few feet away from me. I look up and he apologizes because he didn't mean to frighten me. I say it's fine and go back to my book. He then sits down across from me and I realize he was saying hi to me. He introduces himself as Gabe and says he works in the cafeteria and just finished his shift. I just nod politely and I'd like to note my entire body language was ""I'm trying to be by myself.""

He asks me if I go to school here and I say yes. He makes some small talk with me before immediately launching into ""So what do I have to do to get to know you better?"" and I freeze a little. He repeats himself and I don't know what to say at that point. After some silence, he asks if I have a boyfriend to which I reply yes (not even as a way to make him back off, I honestly do and at that point, I wished he was there at that moment). He says he figured because I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever seen but I probably know I'm beautiful since I'm probably told that all the time.

That was my first signal that this guy was making me uncomfortable. He then goes on to say that he loves white women and how if he could lock a white woman down, he would be set for life and that he's sick of black girls because they're so ""hood"" and ""selfish"" as well as how white girls are so ""caring"" and ""classy"". This is my next signal because aside from how uncomfortable I already was, just how he was talking about women really rubbed me the wrong way. I look down at my phone and send a quick text to a friend asking her to call me really quickly. He keeps talking about this one white girl he used to date who was so perfect but he let her go and he regrets it. I'd never been in this situation before so before you ask me why I didn't just leave, I was just scared to be honest. She calls me shortly after, I say I have a call to take, and then leave as fast as I can. She asks what happened and I tell her. She says he probably just wanted to take a chance. I agreed to a point but everything about how he talked made me uncomfortable. I figured this was a one-time thing and forgot about it.

Until the next week.

I go back out to the lobby the following week and there he is again, standing by the door. I go to leave and he blocks my exit, smiling. He starts trying to chat me up saying how he's sad he couldn't get my number last week and he'd love to talk to me some more because I'm just his type. I tell him I'm not interested and I have to leave. He keeps pushing for me to give him my number but thankfully with other people behind me this time I was able to leave.

The next week after, a girl I met joined me leaving class and we were chatting as we were project partners. We get down to the lobby and we see him again. She asks if I know him and I explain what happened to me. She and I walk to the door and he tries to get to me but she blocks him off. He says that he and I know each other and that we always talk. She says that she and I have stuff to work on so we have to leave right now. He looks annoyed at her but we quickly make an exit. 

Now I'm scared. I've already told this guy no so many times and he actually waits for me until I get out of classes. I don't know how to proceed or what to do but now I dread going to my classes because I'm scared he might just show up again and again.

598,throwawayphonecheck,Relationships,5qntew,2028,"Hi Reddit/r

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. 

She asked me out during my last year of college and things went from there. I will say that during the first month to 6 weeks she became attached very fast. I'm talking light your brains on fire sex every single day and her telling me how much she loves me.

fast forward 2 years and there is absolutely no sex, no foreplay, nothing.

It has been this way for 6 or 7 months. She suddenly wants to wait until we get married. She asks if I am going to propose almost every day. ""When are you going to propose? Did you buy a ring? Why haven't you proposed yet?""

No, I have not gotten a ring. Her constant talk of marriage makes me uncomfortable. 

But also, she checks my phone a lot. Any female friend I have (not many as she is extremely jealous) gets me 20 questions. Whether they're snap chats, work texts or if I see someone in public, I get grilled.

I notice that I receive snaps and they're already opened so I miss them. She looks over my shoulder when I text or asks every time who I am texting. It's pretty crappy.

Here's the other side to this coin...

She has TONS of guy friends. Orbiters if you will. A bunch of single blokes who constantly snapchat, message or call. Does it bother me? not really. The double standard bothers me more.

She flipped out on me for having a conversation with an old friend (girl-in a 6 year relationship) from college last week and took my phone and began to type a rude message. I managed to get my phone back before she pressed send.

But I notice that when she texts, she turns he body so that I would have no chance to see the screen. Specifically, she just met this new dude and I know she's messaging him (she told me) as a new friend. Yeah... 

Honestly, I don't trust her anymore because I feel that she does not trust me or herself.

There's more to the story... but you get the idea.


I DONT CHECK HER PHONE.

Hi r/relationships. Thanks for all of your advice in my previous post. To those of you giving me information on programs in Japan - thank you! I took all of your advice to heart, but unfortunately I already have a job in the STEM field lined up to begin this summer and programs like those are not in the realm of possibilities.

Anyway, on to the actual update. I talked to Jack the night after I made my post. I told him that I knew his parents meant well by it, but the way they were constantly filling me in on the details of their trip made me more sad than interested. At first Jack didn?t understand what I was trying to say or why hearing about the trip would upset me; when I reminded him about my rejection from the study abroad program and the time he?d spent helping me work through that, he was able to empathize a little more. 

Jack told me he recognized that his parents were, albeit indirectly, being rude by going out of their way to tell me about the vacation. He said that gushing so much about a vacation to anyone who wasn?t going was insensitive and if I asked them politely they would tone it down. Unfortunately, he refused to talk to them himself. I?d requested that he do so to get things resolved a little more smoothly, but in the end it was up to me. 

I decided to call ahead and visit Jack?s parents privately to have the conversation, instead of during or after one of our dinners (that would have been awkward). I broached the subject with his parents by saying that I appreciated their thoughtfulness in trying to keep me updated on the vacation planning, but that travel to Japan was still a sore subject to me and hearing about it made me sad. I spoke for a while about my dream to travel there, the study abroad, and how I was very regretful that the experience had impacted me so strongly. It was incredibly selfish of me to get jealous so easily, and I planned to work on my sensitivity in light of the issue. I had hoped that by making the conversation more focused on my behavior than theirs, it would deflect the blame from them and feel like less of a direct attack. It did not work so well.

Throughout my whole monologue, they were completely silent. As soon as I finished, Jack?s mom said quite coldly, ?I?m sorry you?re offended.? I kept the conversation going for a few more minutes, trying my hardest to reiterate that it wasn?t their fault, but I received only short, cold responses. Jack?s dad did not speak at all and walked out of the room as soon as I stood up to leave. Before I left I thanked his mother for speaking with me and said I?d see them at dinner during the week. Her only response was ?we?ll see.? 

When I told Jack about the confrontation, he was confused by their reaction but changed his stance on the whole thing. Now he?s saying that I was being unreasonable from the start and I should?ve been able to tell they would take it poorly as it was rude of me to mention it to them at all. He insists that they would have had the same reaction if he had told them instead of me. 

Over the course of the week Jack?s parents never contacted me about dinner, which the four of us usually have together weekly. Our dinner dates are always on Wednesday, so yesterday I decided to take the plunge and give his mom a call. I asked if she was still on for our usual Wednesday dinner and told her I?d been wanting to make a new recipe for them to try for a while now. She said, ?sorry, that?s not going to work.? And that was the end of the conversation.

So here?s where I am now, hurt and completely confused. His parents are ignoring me completely and my relationship with Jack is strained since he vehemently denies supporting me at all. I?m at a loss for what to do here. I don?t know why either of them reacted like this. Any advice is appreciated, as always, but I?ve decided to just see if time will mend the wounds. In the meantime, I?m reconsidering my relationship with all three of them. 

**EDIT**: Jack's mom called me on the phone a couple of hours ago. In a nutshell, she told me very spitefully that they brought it up to me so frequently to make me jealous. She said they were hoping I would eventually break down and beg them to pay for me to come - that way they could show Jack that I am of a lesser social standing and ""not a good fit"" for him. Then, she basically broke up with me for Jack over the phone (wtf?). I am honestly at such a loss here, maybe this was just a lie she made up because she was offended but even so it's incredibly hurtful. I have no idea if Jack knows about any of this but I don't care, I am done with him and them, I do not want to be associated with such classist, manipulative people. This was such a terrific waste of three years of my life.

**TL;DR** talked to boyfriend, he understood but wanted me to tell the parents myself. They were upset, Jack has apparently taken their side, and parents have avoided contact for the past week.

600,bfcrazythrow,? Locked Post ?,3mb8n5,2025,"Theres no non-awkward way to say this, my bf has an eagle living at his house. The first time I went over he warned me not to freak out because it might be inside the house when we walked in. I thought he was joking because people don't really own birds like that, but he told me it was real and he doesn't really own it, that it comes and goes as it pleases and is more of a ""friend"". 

He leaves the window open all the time because it likes to come inside. He's not worried about people breaking in because he lives out in the country and the bird is very territorial. He said he's trained it to not mess up his house or go to the bathroom inside.

I think he's freaking nuts. The bird is huge, like 3 feet tall, and he has to use gloves to handle it because it's claws are sharp. I think it's incredibly dangerous, but he said he's been ""friends"" with the bird since he was 10. That he just started feeding it one day and it would hang around him. His parents tried to get it to go away but it lived on their roof, eventually they just accepted it.

The bird makes me very uncomfortable. When I'm over at his place it just sort of stares at me, my bf says it's ok because it can tell he likes me. That it's no more dangerous than a dog. He jokingly said ""if it wanted to attack you, it would have already"", which did NOT help.

The whole thing just seems so weird, I feel like he has to be lying about something. His parents tell the same story he does though. At the very least it seems crazy to keep the bird around, or to let it in the house. Am I over-reacting? Is this a deal breaker or should I just learn to deal with it? My bf is great otherwise.

A lot has happened since my last update.  Hopefully this will be the end of the story.

Marjorie's brother became very concerned after speaking to me, and apparently questioned Marjorie extensively about her behaviour.  She continued to claim that she was pregnant with Jonah's baby, and that they had had a lengthy affair -- but the details didn't add up (the brother knew Jonah pretty well, and was generally aware of his work schedule, etc).  She said they were meeting at a hotel at lunchtime three days a week, but he knew that Jonah came home for lunch with me every day.  Stuff like that.  He went home late that night to sleep on it.

After he went home, Marjorie came over to see me at 3AM.  She started screaming at me to come outside, saying that I had ruined her relationship with Jonah, and how happy they were before me, etc etc.  I called the police and her brother, who both arrived around the same time.  She pushed the police officer who tried to ask her what was going on, and was immediately arrested.  I felt bad for her brother, but he just apologised to me repeatedly.  Marjorie yelled expletives and tried to demand special treatment because the police were apparently ""hurting her baby"" by keeping her in the car.  I gave a statement, and they left.  

Not exactly sure what happened after, but her brother says she is now under psychiatric evaluation, and is apparently struggling with a mental disorder that he wouldn't name (she has apparently not taken her meds in two years).  I didn't ask for details, but it seems she is going to get some help.  I'm not pressing any sort of charges.

Her brother also linked me to his post on social media, where he made it very clear that Marjorie has been having some difficulties, and absolutely none of what she said about Jonah is true.

I'm glad this seems to be over, but I've decided I need a fresh start no matter what.  I'm looking for a job out of state, and I'll be doing my best to leave my life with Jonah behind.

So after he breaks it to me that he doesn't want me in his life after his mom dies, I gave him some space for a few days. And after a few days he did get back in touch with me. It was a little distant, but basically like nothing had changed. He went down to see his mom and spoiler! She's still alive, at least as far as I know. Granted, her health isn't great, but she's still with us.

He gets back and continues to engage with me as if we are together, although it feels distant. He's been having some health problems and claims to be in so much pain that he's not able to talk or text me very much. His health issues are not new- a few months ago he claims he was diagnosed with an ulcer. But then every time I communicated with him, he kept hinting that he may have a more serious problem. This turns into suggesting that he thinks he has stomach cancer. I know him to be a bit of a hypochondriac but I know that he's really not feeling well so I leave him alone when he asks me too, and offer to help take care of him. He refuses my help, although he thanks me for my willingness to be there for him.

The other thing that keeps me from feeling too worried about him was that he has been milking the ""cancer"" angle for a while. Earlier in the year he was losing a lot of weight and was worried he had cancer- turns out he did not. Then his ex got cancer and manipulated him into helping him take care of her as she underwent a surgical procedure. I was uncomfortable with that situation but I felt like it would be selfish and petty to be anything but supportive. Then later this summer he claims his sister-in-law (with whom he is very close) also has Hodgkin's stage 4 and demands that I leave him alone all night (which I did.) So when his feeling crummy escalates from ulcer to stomach cancer, I'm privately a little skeptical but I offered up my support. And regardless of what it is, I've been VERY worried about him.

So after he finishes summer school, I was hoping that we'd be able to spend some time together. He claims that he's still in too much pain to call, text, or come visit. But on Wednesday he lets me know that he's going camping. I was frustrated by this because he claimed to not have time to see me for six weeks, but he was able to make time to go camping. He claims that it's a networking thing, and that he will be uncomfortable and in pain every minute, but he just HAS to go. He then asks if he can stop by on Monday. But Monday doesn't work for me- I work on the weekdays and wouldn't get to spend any time with him.

I tell him that Mondays aren't such a good fit for me and ask if he can make time for me on the weekend, because I don't feel close to him anymore and I want to spend time reconnecting and spending actual time together. He says he  can't because he's going out of town, and then started to guilt trip me about ""what he's up against,"" and tells me that he might not even be able to see me on Monday because depending on how his tests go, he might start chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. So now ""stomach cancer"" has morphed into straight up Hodgkin's lymphoma- NONE of which has been actually substantiated by an actual diagnosis. I back down.

Later I text him to apologize and tell him I didn't realize how tight his schedule was. He texts me back ""I f#cking hate you right now.""

So naturally I didn't respond to this. Later on he tells me that he needs me to ""not be in his life for a few weeks"" while he ""figures out his health stuff."" I tell him that the feeling is mutual, and that being sick is not an excuse to be mean to me, and that wanting a voice in the relationship doesn't make me selfish. I also told him that ""if apologizing to you makes you irate, then you need to leave me alone.""

He responds by saying ""I will leave you alone forever. Goodbye, ApartPersonality. I won't block you but please don't contact me."" I have not heard from him since, and I have not tried to contact him. And I'm ok with that.

I feel lonely but I also feel so much less stressed out. I'm not even upset this time. I didn't realize how much the fake emergencies, guilt-tripping, cold-shouldering, and just all around unpleasantness had been weighing on me until it was gone. I'm starting to suspect that this dude has actually mental problems. I highly doubt he actually has cancer- it's just another pretense to gain emotional control, create a false sense of urgency, and use it to subject everyone else's needs to his.

None of my other relationships have been this dramatic and chaotic. I think he secretly LOVES drama and creating it makes him feel wanted. I think I've finally gotten to a point where I can move on with my life.

**TLDR:** Dude is actually probably crazy, tried to use cancer to manipulate me, now I'm out.

Firstly, thank you to everyone on Reddit for all your messages and comments of support and advice.  I benefited from each and every one of your insights and I appreciate it immensely.

I flew back to X's hometown yesterday and went to the hospital to see her Mother.  She is very unwell.  She is devastated.  She barely spoke the entire time I was there.  But she did ask me to organise ""whatever was necessary"" and said that she would support me 100%.

On this note, she is being cremated.  We are not having a service.  I will however meet with a few of her close friends for a scotch, to celebrate her life.  We will talk only of the good times and get drunk and merry on the thought that she enriched our lives.

I have, with her Mother's permission, used money from X's bank account to pay for the cremation but also contributed some of my own to cover it.  X did not have a lot of savings.  I did not mention this to her Mother.

I updated the Facebook with the status I posted -- minus the reference to sending out individual messages to people.  I know a lot of people will disagree with this.  I spoke to her Mother about it and we decided it was best.  Her Facebook only allowed visibility of her close friends (<200 people) and she was very explicit in her wanting everyone around her to know the complete picture.

I then got into contact with individual people and passed on her messages.  I reached out to her ex-boyfriend.  I sent him what she had said and he asked for my phone number.  An hour long conversation ensued.  He cried for most of it.  He was so sad.  It was heart breaking.

My brain is an absolute mess right now.  I am so confounded by the events of the past couple of days.  A few days ago I had a best friend.  A best friend who was beautiful, intelligent, enlightening, vivacious and wonderful.  She lit the world on fire with her charisma, her smile and her effervescent joy.

Please, please, please. Something has to come from this death. I have received countless messages from you all, reaching out, and telling me that you have felt the same way (I WILL reply to these in a day or so when I have the emotional strength to do so).  I don't want to see the loss of another best friend.  I don't want to see anyone else in the position I am in right now.

Please, reach out to those around you.  Be open and kind and willing to listen and help.  Please, if you are suicidal call a friend.  Reach out.  Tell them how you feel.  If she had called me... I am confident I could have prevented this.

After I had spoken to her Mother I went to her house to pack up some of her things.  I came across her diary.  In the month before she died she had an entry about all the beauty she could see in life and how she would never, ever want to check herself out of that.

Bipolar is an unpredictable, cruel and non-relenting illness.  It gave my best friend false security in her own piece of mind.  It made her believe she could protect herself.

Please.  Don't be complacent.  Get help.  Help others.

This post might be long, but I'm going to post it anyway. I hope it helps someone else, if they're in a similar situation. If you want the backstory, I'll type it out for reference (my own reference, and for others who may benefit). If not, just scroll down to the ""What I learned"" section. It's extremely important.


First off, Reddit, I'd like to thank you so much. To every single person who replied to me - you were a crucial voice in a chorus of people telling me to leave him.


**The tipping points:**


After my post, things got so much worse. I thought life would be better when I moved back to my hometown and saw him more often - but they didn't. He was just as untrusting, 3 times as clingy, and a million times more dissatisfied with our relationship.


On one hand, I was happy I could finally be with him. But he was not happy to be with me at all. He expected me to put up with so much. For example, one day we went to go pick up a paycheck at my work, then we were going to go to the mall. When I walked into work with him, he was basically acting like a child - tons of PDA, whining, etc. I work with kids, for crying out loud! I didn't want the kids, or my boss to see some guy hanging all over me and doing a baby voice trying to get me to kiss him. I told him to please wait until we got into the car, but he then insulted me, saying that I needed to get over my social anxiety. He sulked the entire day at the mall. I kept asking what was wrong, and he wouldn't tell me. I tried SO SO hard to find out if he was truly okay. I bought some jewelry at a store, and when we got into his car, I tried it on because I was excited. He blew up at me, calling me conceited and saying that it was so rude to be focusing on myself even though he was so sad. Even I knew that was complete bullshit - this was the first moment I had focused on myself all day.


The above story is just one example of the amount of times that I'd tell him to stop doing something --> he'd sulk --> I'd devote hours of energy trying to help him --> he'd insult me for focusing on myself when I finally gave up. This pattern became very clear, especially in the weeks following.


In those weeks following, we both went on vacation. I wanted to enjoy my reunion with my family, but he was mad because I wasn't devoting enough of my time to him. When he went on vacation, a ton of truth was revealed. Long story short, his mom hit his sister one night when everyone was drunk. He was texting me and threatened that he would never forgive me if I went to bed instead of supporting him (it was 3am and I was very tired). He also said that the only person he'd ever loved was his sister, and that he isn't fulfilled by me because I'm not half the woman that she is. I understand he felt very betrayed by many people in his life at this moment, but his lack of appreciation for me in this moment really stood out as just plain rude.


A few days after the incident with his mom and sister happened, he confessed to me that both him and his sister have been hit before, but that he doesn't see anything wrong with it. Still, he claimed that he was ""ready to change"" and that he was going to improve himself as a person. I asked him if he was considering therapy to assure that he could maintain a healthy relationship with me despite his horrible relationship with his mom, and he said no. He said there was NOTHING wrong with him and that he would never go to therapy. Instead, he told me, he was going to join martial arts so that he could become stronger, and kill anyone who ever laid a hand on his sister. This was basically the tipping point. I understand rage and anger. I understand that sometimes you have the urge to hurt people. But I realized, in that moment, that if he ever found an excuse to hurt me - it could very well be permanent, or fatal. He is already extremely strong and big. I was afraid, and I didn't want to stick around and wait until he hurt me.
I told him this - I told him that becoming physically stronger was not the answer, that he needed to figure out how to work through his feelings. He told me, ""No, stop pushing me to go to therapy. If me refusing therapy is a dealbreaker, then so be it.""


At this point, I was feeling very strong and secure in myself. I had been seeing my therapist regularly, I had built up a group of online friends (that he didn't know about, so he couldn't forbid me to talk to them), I had started working out and eating healthy, I was writing a play, I was having a good time at my job. If there was a good time to leave the relationship, it was here - when my self-worth was at the highest it's been the whole relationship. I think, subconciously, I was preparing the strength to leave him.


It took a few days for me to process what he was saying, but in short, I figured out the message: He was not going to change, ever. He would never be fulfilled by me. He would only get worse since he is unwilling to confront his problems. Until the day where he is willing to take a good honest look at himself and his issues, he will not be able to participate in a healthy relationship.


**The breakup:**


Long story short, we both sort of ""gave up"" and broke up. I talked with him and told him that this relationship wasn't good for either of us. He agreed heartily. I unfollowed him on social media and we said our goodbyes. He asked if we could be friends...I said we could remain cordial, but I'd rather take a break for now. This was a HUGE mistake, given what happened next.


**Post-breakup mess:**


I was doing perfectly fine for the next two weeks. I had only cried once, for about an hour or so. Besides that, I was having the time of my life. I didn't know what to do with all the freedom. One night, my self-esteem plummeted suddenly. That's when I fucked up.


So, we shared a tumblr blog, where we would share things for the other person. I had unfollowed all social media at this point, but while ruminating over my low self-esteem, I thought of our memories together. I realized that I had forgotten to remove myself from that blog. I went to go remove myself from it, but that's when I got a huge fucking shock - he had posted, IN DETAIL, about a blowjob he had gotten from some girl on Tinder. I was filled with rage - not because I was upset he had moved on, but that he would be SO DISRESPECTFUL as to post it on our SHARED blog that he KNEW I would see at some point. I was also enraged at the fact that he had berated me for MONTHS about the fact that I'd had casual sex before, but then goes out and does it, then bragged about it. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to drive to his house and scream at him until he cried. I've never been so angry in my life - I scared myself. I made another mistake here - I called him. Luckily, I was calm and composed on the outside. I told him that it was disrespectful as hell to post something of that nature on our SHARED blog, and that I wouldn't accept any excuse. He tried to make excuses, but I hung up. Here's where I fixed my mistake of contacting him...I immediately blocked and deleted him on everything. Gone without a trace. Haven't looked back. I burned the FUCK out of that bridge, and I'm proud of it.


That incident caused me an incredible amount of pain and rage; at the same time, it gave me the final push to get him ALL the way out of my life. He was continuing to try to emotionally manipulate me even though we were broken up - I am never going to put up with that shit, ever again.


**What I learned:**


Here's the good part, Reddit. I hope that someone else reads this and will be able to take an honest look at themselves and their relationship, as I did.

1. He was much, much harsher on me than I thought he was. I couldn't see it because I loved him much, much more in love with him than I should've been. Looking back, I remembered that we had taken a short break at one point in our relationship. During that time, he called me up and YELLED at me, straight-up YELLED that he hated me, that I was a bitch, that he resented me more than anyone else, that I ruined his life. I still forgave him and got back together with him, because I assumed he just didn't mean it. The question that I asked myself, that opened my eyes, was this: ""Out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, there has been ONE person who wanted to hurt you badly enough that he told you he hated you and that you were a bitch. And out of the billions and billions of people on this earth, you somehow love him the most. Shouldn't he have been disqualified from your heart the moment he called you up for the sole reason of hurting you?""


2. I ignored huge red flags, and I'm lucky that I got out when I did. He has already been violent with people before. About a year ago, he got blackout drunk and punched some people, as well as slamming a guy through a glass wall (which shattered it) and breaking two tables in half, one of them being a ping-pong table. This alone should've been a red flag, but coupled with other aggressive behavior...it's haunting. I've gotten drunk with him many times. I trusted him too deeply, and I'm honestly luckily to be physically un-harmed right now.

3. My worth is not dependent on him. My new outlook is based on the idea that ""worth"" is separate from a ""bond"" with someone. A bond is based upon many things, one of them being compatibility. Since we were not compatible, that means that our BOND was unable to work out, but my worth is still intact. Obviously I'm not a perfect person, but I also needed to stop basing perfection on HIS standards. Whenever I do something and then reflexively think, ""wow, I'm too selfish"" or ""wow, I talk too much,"" I add the words ""for him"" at the end. Yes, I was too selfish for him, I was too sad for him, I was too much for him. Then I ask: but what about for ME? There are obviously times when I go overboard and don't act like a great person. But most of the time, I'm enough for myself, and I'm not selfish or conceited or fucked up. There's nothing seriously wrong (and if there was, I have a support system to help me work on those things).


4. I am a loving, kind person, who has many amazing qualities. I didn't realize this when I was with him, but my god am I gentle. I'm empathetic and understanding. I have amazing self-control, I'm considerate, I'm direct and honest with people. I value authenticity, I'm open, I'm a good listener, and I'm dependable. Those are just a few things that I like about myself - I'm sure it'll be easier to think of more as time goes on. I'm not a piece of shit, but he had me convinced that I was. He made me feel like I had zero good qualities, that I couldn't positively affect the world. He was always looking for the worst in me, the bad intentions, the secret darkness that I supposedly had in my heart. But no. I'm not a dark or vindictive person. I'm not saying I'm the best person in the world, but I've seen enough evil to know that I would never stoop to that level.


5. Even if I felt bad for him, that doesn't mean I had to stay. He was very damaged as a person from his childhood, which is probably why he was so horrible to me. But it is NOT my responsibility to be his punching bag. I deserve respect just as much as anyone else. The best way to get him to realize the error of his ways was not to stay in relationship with him. By staying with him, I was sending him the message ""you can hurt me as much as you like, and I'll still love you, so you get to feel like there's nothing wrong with your behavior."" By breaking up with him, I was sending the message that I respected myself and him too much to continue accepting such hurtful behavior. Of course, when he ultimately gets into another relationship, I will feel slightly upset if it's successful. I will probably ask myself, ""why couldn't he change for ME? What makes HER so special?"" But on the other hand, it would be a relief to see him heal as a person. I don't want any other girl to go through what I went through, because it absolutely affected my life for a long while. He held me back from so much, but now I'm exercising, I'm writing, I'm hanging out with people, I'm doing things I never dared do when I was with him (in fear of his anger).


6. Although I'm trying to avoid basing my validation in others, it is helpful to note that people DO love me. So many friends were overjoyed when they heard about the breakup. Many asked, ""Is is okay to say that I'm relieved about this?"" Every single person told me that they were so worried about me but they didn't know what to do, but that they're so excited to have ""me"" back. They're excited that I'm not a huge ball of anxiety, that I don't have to miss events to talk to him, that I don't have to lie and defend him to cover up his bad behavior. Everyone is being very reasonable with me, I'm going out with friends all the time, I'm getting complimented on qualities I didn't even know I had. I'm reaching out to old friends and reconnecting, I'm being introduced to new people, I'm joining things. I'm also going on lots of casual dates/have hooked up with some people. I forgot what it was like to have someone who was enthusiastic about making me feel good, but now I'm basking in it. I'm surrounding myself with different kinds of love - when someone doesn't behave in a loving way, it's so much easier to set limits and boundaries. I am a lot less lenient. I'll admit, this has ended a close friendship (because I realized how toxic she was to me). But I'm also surrounded with so many others who support me. I support myself, as well, so there's no way I will feel alone. If I would've known how absolutely loved I'd feel even without him, I would've broken up with him a long time ago. There is no emptiness in my life - it is fuller than ever before.


7. I trust myself so much more. Not only because my ex is not around to gaslight me, but because I know that I am fully capable of making healthy decisions about myself. I trust my perceptions. I can see red flags much more easily. Just today, my ex messaged me somewhere I forgot to block him. His message was long, and seemed heartfelt on a surface level. But I could see every instance of subtle manipulation, every humblebrag, every backhanded compliment, every instance of blame-shifting. The moment I read it, I DIDN'T feel like he'd changed, and I didn't have ANY urge to go back to him. I didn't buy into that bullshit even for a SECOND, and that's how I know that I've changed. I quickly blocked him on that platform as well, and fully intend to never reply to the message. I trust myself to protect my own heart, and to not jump back into a situation that I know will hurt me. A year ago, I did the exact opposite: I fell into his arms. But now...I feel so incredibly stable, that he could never knock me off-balance like he did before.


Thank you to whoever read this, it means a lot. I needed to vent about the things I learn. Overall, I do have my weak moments. But goddamn, my soul is growing stronger every day. Leaving him, and getting to experience the benefits of being without him...it's worth every second of occasional loneliness.

SO. A lot has happened.

Let me just say I appreciate everything you guys have told me. I reread your comments and it's amazing how many instances I ignored from my parents that was *extremely* wrong of them to do. Thank you so much for your advice, and concerns, I felt extremely vindicated but more than that, I finally felt ""not crazy"" which was extremely important to me.

Anyway. On to the update!

So after reading all the comments, I made the decision to apply to jobs. I applied to all I could find, and actually landed a decent paying job as a front desk associate. Also, I got two grants from my school to pay for my entire tuition, AND have some extra money! So yay!!

I landed the job, got my grant money, and talked to my boyfriend. We both agreed that I should move out, and he was more than willing to have me move in for 500 a month. I was thrilled, and sat down with my parents.

They did not take it well.

They told me I couldn't live somewhere else and stay on their insurance. They told me I was making the worst decision of my life, and threatened to take me off all insurance and to cut me off completely. As a person who has to take Prozac everyday to function like a normal human being, this terrified me. They told me they ""let"" me get a job this time (even though I did it behind their backs) but that moving out against the ""agreement"" they had with me (we never had an agreement...they simply told me that I had to live with them, period.) 

This broke my heart and my boyfriend decided to talk with them next time with me, this time bringing a financial planning paper we both worked on to show we thought about things and we had a budget and talked to his parents and they were thrilled and everything. 

My parents shot me down again. The entire meeting in front of my boyfriend, my parents told me I was incapable of living on my own, that I wouldn't last out there in the ""real world"" and that I never finished anything I sought out to do. Even though I am a straight A student. Even though I got not one, but TWO college grants. Even though I am literally a state champion in speech and debate. They guilted me and made me feel bad for wanting to move out, accusing me of abandoning the family, and told me flat out that I will fail, period. That I would not be able to accomplish anything and that I will be miserable. I'm not even exaggerating, they legit said I wouldn't accomplish anything. 

I then tried to compromise, and asked them if I was to still live at home, to allow me to live a relatively free life to come and go, and if they wanted me to quit my job, give me a little bit more to live off of since I'm trying to make a life for myself out there. Nope. They said I belonged at home, period, for the sake of me being home in case they needed me. I don't mind helping out at all, but home for the sake of just being around? Doing nothing?

Writing this, I still feel like I'm plain out disobeying them and feeling guilty for feeling upset at how they treated me. I feel like I have to justify every sentence I say, and that in itself isn't right. I think they love me in their way. But i couldn't live with them anymore.

At this moment I realized my parents would never look at me and see anything but the mistakes I've made in my life, and see me as a crutch. I was so sad I didn't have their support. But I got out.

Now, I live with my boyfriend and things are good. We are still packing, but I have never felt happier. I look forward to going home now, I barely have panic attacks, and my job is going very well. I'm learning how to budget for bills, and after fighting hard I managed to get my parents to keep me on medical insurance, but I think I can make it work. 

Thanks again everyone for their advice. Just wanted to let you all know I took it, and I don't regret it at all.

TL;DR: got out of my parents house, they threatened to cut me out, now I live with boyfriend and feel more at home than I've ever had.

Well once I had cooled down a bit (the first post was written literally about 30-40 mins after I had one of those ""discussions"" with my mom regarding the State of the Chest,) I gave everything some thought and hit the gym (HAH!) It was my weigh-in day after four months of really intense work, and I'm glad to start seeing noticeable un-ignorable results. I came home, went to bed, and then didn't see my parents until monday night dinner. 


That being said, I was not at all expecting the amount of responses I got, and I'm so so thankful for each and every one of them. You guys are really the best, even the joke comments were able to keep me laughing. 


So, onto the meat and potatoes. 


I finally had a sit down with mom and dad on Monday and asked them to explain to me why they thought I needed any kind of surgery. What came through, after much prodding, and defensiveness, was actually what I think maybe only one or two of the last post's commenters might have seen coming. Turns out, my parents *hate* that I am not dating a man of my own country/culture. They feel I'm ""dating down"" or ""settling"" with my current boyfriend, and they think I'm just not attractive to men of my race/culture due to my (comparatively, but not objectively) small chest. Somehow in their minds they thought I would be much more willing to dump my boyfriend once a ton of hot, tan, latino guys came running at my doors... I honestly could not believe the shit they were spewing. 


I felt sick. 


Like. I knew they weren't thrilled with my choice in boyfriend... But after two years I'd hoped they had gotten over that. It was insane. I told them under no uncertain terms that if they so much as mentioned my tits or my boyfriend in a derogatory manner again, I was cutting them from my life entirely.

Today I requested more hours at my current job, and while not tied into my actual college major (I only worked part-time while interning at something that WAS in my degree field, but now that internships's ending and I will go on to full time at my current company,) the work is lucrative enough that within the next month or so I should be able to move out of my parent's home. Gonna miss the cats. But now I get to try and find a studio or something similar so I can move. Wasn't planning on doing it til October, but eh. March will do.

I didn?t realise I still had access to this account and my initial post gained a few responses so I thought it might be worth posting a somewhat interesting update.

Shortly after I made that initial post, I still received missed calls etc. I utilised some of the advice from the past thread with no success but then something weird happened. 

First they started asking if I can send them gifts (understandable given the contrast in our living situations). They then started messaging me in grammatically correct/full English just straight up asking for money or things of material value, literally naming brands etc. This is where I think one of the adults took the phone and was messaging me. 

I responded to say that I wish I could buy and send them the things they wanted but I sadly can not afford it (which is true, our shared bio parent earned a high income which maybe set an expectation). 

The calls and messages literally stopped after that. 

I?m really not sure what happened but I think they were under the impression that I am wealthy and this was a gateway to presents/money. I really don?t know who was messaging me. In the comments of my last post, I touched base on how their bio parent cut off all communication with us related to something that was money motivated. I can?t really divulge the full details without revealing a lot of information that I don?t want to (estate related) but it was messy and hurt a lot of people in my family. 

I?m a little saddened by that but I also am aware there could be other factors in the situation. As per my last post I was not and am still not really ready for a full relationship but hopefully that?ll be something do-able in the future. 

TL:DR - Tried to follow advice from last post. Found that communication may have only started so that they potentially can receive money/items from me but alas, I am poor.

608,throwawaybudgetissue,Relationships,3o40d2,2014,"My husband (fake name is Tim) and I have been together for 5 years and married for two years. Before I became pregnant, our relationship was great. We hardly every fought and we were best friends. Tim works in finance and I am a welder. I am also four months pregnant.

After I found out I was pregnant, my husband did a complete 180. We weren't planning on having a baby until we were both at least 30, but we also weren't as careful with using condoms as we could have been. Suddenly, he couldn't trust me anymore and he suspected that I was cheating on him. He never went so far as to ask for a paternity test or outright accuse me of cheating, but it was always heavily implied.

Tim seemed to have mostly gotten over his insecurities about the pregnancy, but now he's saying that I should stay at home and take care of the baby instead of going back to work. I've explained to him over and over again that I will not give up my career. Tim is trying to rationalize his demand by saying that daycare will be expensive, but when I suggest that he quit his job to take care of the baby, he says it isn't a realistic option. This is bs because I earn $29/hour plus overtime and Tim earns $24/hour. When I asked him about the real reason why he doesn't want me to return to work, Tim admitted that he was concerned about my male coworkers and that he was worried I might be using my job to cheat on him! It didn't have anything to do with my job safety and everything to do with him thinking I am cheating.

At this point, I am so fed up by Tim and his attitude towards me that I am willing to call his bluff. Tim says that if I go back to work, that he is going to leave because he can't trust me. I want to tell him that if he makes the demand again, to make the demand using a stack of divorce papers instead of words. I love my husband, but the way he's treating me has me so angry and hurt that I'm not sure I want to put up with him and his attitude any longer. I would still be keeping the baby, but being a single mom sounds nicer than living with a man who accuses me of cheating on him.


   
**tl;dr**: Husband and I had a great marriage until I became pregnant. Now he thinks I am cheating on him and wants me to quit my job and stay at home with the baby. I am not cheating on him and I am so angry at being accused that I don't know if I want to keep fighting to save this marriage any longer.

**Edit: I've realized that posting this on reddit is a sign that I am mentally over this relationship and that it's not worth fighting over. I was going to wait for Tim to come around again, but he has put me in a position where I have to defend and justify my own existence and needs as a human being.

Link to the original post - http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rsy3i/just_found_out_something_terrible_about_me_19f/#

Thanks for all the comments and stuff. You've really helped even just to help me pull my thoughts together. This is gonna be my last post as I've a lot to deal with but at least I've got my parents to help me.

My dad took me out to a small park not far from our home to talk. I burst out crying when I tried to tell him what I heard. He just about heard me say that I knew about the rape and stuff before I collapsed into a sobbing mess.

He just held me and told me it was alright. When I had pulled myself together he asked me how much I knew so I told him.

Dad took us back home and sent me into the dining room while he got mom. He told her what this was all about before she arrived in so she was well prepared for the crying fit I had the minute I saw her. I was way more upset about it all than she was. She just wanted to make sure I was alright.

I know some posters were right in that it didn't happen to me so I shouldn't be too upset but it happened to my mom. I can't stop crying when I think of that.

We talked and there is soooooo much more to my family's history than I ever thought! My mom was married before she met my dad. She was too young - like 18! - and my grandparents didn't approve. This man - gonna refer to him as B - was a bit older and soon afterwards moved them to fairly well known city that I won't name. B became incredibly controlling and abusive to her which explains a lot really. She's really defensive of me with boyfriends.

The marriage started falling apart after about a year and she planned on leaving him by going home. When she told him that it was over, B beat her black and blue and raped her in their flat.

I admit I got really choked up at that part but my mom was like a rock. I've never seen her so calm and reassuring which makes me feel like shit because I should have been helping her. She told me that afterwards she was petrified of him and ended up staying in their small flat like a prisoner - only going out when he told her to. She wouldn't tell me more about what happened but I guess he didn't stop taking what he wanted.

I'm not sure of the exact timeline as its still all new for me but it was definitely a couple of months later he was taking her to the store for bits and pieces when they got into a car crash. He was killed instantly but my mom got out with a couple of broken bones. That's when they told her she was pregnant.

My mom told me she genuinely didn't know. She went to therapy for a few years after and the guy treating her told her that sometimes the mind refuses to recognize signs like pregnancy to protect itself. Sort of like those teenagers who have babies but don't recognize it until they are in labor. My grandparents offered to take me if she wanted but my mom told me that the minute they told her she knew she was going to keep me. Have to admit I started bawling at that point too.

She had a few pictures and things of the guy who was my father in a box upstairs and offered to show them to me but I'm not ready for that. I asked if there was any relatives from his side hiding out there but my mom told me that he never knew his parents or even if he had siblings. Part of why my grandparents didn't like him was that he was troubled kid from foster-care and never got any further from that.

My parents met when I was barely one and married when I was two. I never ever doubted that my dad was my dad ever. I mean I knew they married after I was born but it never struck me that I might not be directly related. My mom said my dad made the decision that as far as anyone was concerned he was my father. She had left that part about the father empty on my original birth cert so my dad had the birth re-registered so it would have his name. He says I'm his daughter so it felt right to make it official official.

In the end I'm still all kinds of messed up but my mom and dad are the best. They really really are.

tl;dr; My family history is crazy but my mom and dad are great and I'm really lucky.

610,,Non-Romantic,3srya3,2016,"**UPDATE:** **Figured I'd give an update to those who wanted it.

Asheigh's parents called me later, begging me not to press charges, saying this isn't the first time she's done this to her roommates. They cannot afford to repay me for the thousands of dollars that was lost in Ashleigh's fit of rage, they just want me to forgive and forget.

Ashleigh's mother also revealed to me that they filed a fake missing persons report. That Ashleigh had come to them and they had been hiding her. They asked me to just forgive her, because she has these manic episodes very frequently. While she had disclosed her mental illnesses to me before we moved in together, she did not tell me about her manic episodes, her fits of rage and hostility or the fact she has done this before. She had assured me that her illnesses were under control with her medication, and I, believed her. Because at the time I was desperately looking for a place to stay. So for those who were saying I deserved this because I moved in with a person with mental illnesses, go fuck yourself. No one could have seen this coming. I knew absolutely nothing about BPD or Type 1 Bipolar, and she was a seemingly good roommate up until now.

For those who messaged me, telling me I deserved this and that my cats should have died: really, fuck you. If Ashleigh had a problem with watching my cats, she should have said so. I also paid her to take care of my cats while I was gone. She had zero problem taking my money. If I had any inkling of her locking my cats in my room without food and water for two days, do you fucking think I would have left them with her? No. I would have not. 

She has destroyed things that can never be replaced. She tore up pictures of me and my grandparents who are now passed away. She smashed a glass paper weight my uncle gave me when I was 9. She cut holes into clothes that I had saved up for months for. I have two pairs of pants and four shirts to get me through until I am able to afford new clothes, which won't be for a while because I now have to take my 3 cats to the vet to make sure she didn't physically abuse them. I have four pairs of underwear and one bra. I think I have every right to be upset with her. 

I don't care to change the locks. I plan on breaking my lease and moving back in with my parents. My father is sick and he needs me right now. I have called up a few lawyer offices but none can really help me out until Monday.  What little stuff she didn't cut holes into, break, or rip up has been packed up, along with my cats. I'll be leaving for my parents shortly.

I still plan on getting a restraining order against her, at the very least.  Several people have messaged me, telling me I shouldn't press charges against her because of her mental illnesses. Telling me I'm a shit person for calling the cops. She was never missing, her parents just covered for her because I'm not the first person she's done this to.

So, thanks reddit, here's your update. I'll let you know what comes of this later. 


   
**tl;dr**:  **Ashleigh's parents were lying about her being missing. She is ""safe"" with them. I am not the first person she has done this too. Parents can't afford to repay me all of the money damage she's caused me. Moving back in with my parents, because well, fuck this.**

I will try to make this as short as possible. 

I moved in with my roommate Ashleigh (not her real name) almost a year ago. She posted an ad to Craigslist about needing a roommate, and I was looking for a place to live. We hit it off, and a few days later, I was moving in.

Ashleigh was very clear and up front about her mental illnesses. She has Bipolar Type 1 and Borderline Personality Disorder. She also suffers from mild depression. I myself have been diagnosed with GAD. Ashleigh has been hospitalized twice in our time living together.

On Wednesday, I had to take off work and drive five hours to visit my dad - who is currently in the hospital. I asked Ashleigh to look after my cats (I have 3). Nothing major, just make sure they had food and water and clean their litter box at least once a day, if she could. Ashleigh agreed and I left to go be with my family.

I got home last night...and the apartment was...destroyed. That is the only way I can describe it. There were broken dishes and glasses in the cabinet, knives thrown into the wall. The TV was unplugged and on the floor. My cats food bowl was empty and their water bowl was dry as a bone. 

I went into my room and was shocked and horrified at what I saw. She had locked my three cats in my room, where they had urinated and defecated everywhere. My makeup was on the floor, eyeshadow palettes shattered, lipstick smeared on my mirror. My underwear was all cut up on the floor,  and going through my closet, I found holes in my clothes. 

I am in total shock still. I tried to get a hold of Ashleigh, but has blocked me on facebook and isn't answering my calls. I've contacted both her parents and her boyfriend and they have not heard from her since Thursday. Her parents have now filed a missing persons report on her. 

She has destroyed so much of my things. and I don't even understand why she did this.  Not at all. 

What do I do reddit? I'm beginning to freak out here. I know we'll never get our security deposit back due to the damage she has done to the walls of the apartment ($800 gone there). She destroyed hundreds of dollars worth of makeup and clothes. No one can get ahold of her and i'm starting to worry about her too. My cats were left alone and hungry for at least two days now.

I've taken pictures of everything and have copies of them. The police were contacted but I was told until Ashleigh can be found, there isn't much that can be done. I've never had this happen before and I am really lost.

I am reading every single one of these comments, and it's just so many I don't think I can reply! You guys are amazingly sweet and have made my entire day. Thank you again. I did not expect so many people to care! 



It all started last month..my friend works with my husband, they both work at a hospital. And she told me one day that she wasn't trying to cause any problems, or start something..but she felt like his relationship with one of his co-workers wasn't very appropriate. She said she thought it seemed like he was very flirty with her, and she was concerned. Turns out they were doing more than just flirting at work. 

We are getting divorced now, and now that all this has happened.. He's not the amazing sweet guy I thought I married..something changed or he lied for 8 years. We got into a big fight about it, and he told me I'm way too old to ever find somebody to love me again, guys are only interested in young beautiful girls and that's why he cheated on me, I wasn't attractive anymore or worth anything.

I'm absolutely horrified and devastated. Is it true that nobody will want me? I mean, I take care of myself. I exercise, I eat right, I'm really a fun person. I have no kids..But because I'm 38, is all of that meaningless and no guy will ever love me? I've been so depressed since all this happened. He never had hurt me before, I thought we were amazing. Now I'm questioning absolutely everything. I lost my husband who I thought was perfect, my life is ruined and now I might be alone forever?

Well things blew up. I decided shortly after posting and feeling very low and sad that I needed to go on vacation. I called my parents and told them the situation and planned to go stay with them at the beach for a few days to clear my head. 


I let my BF know that I was going away for a couple days, in which he freaked out and broke up with me saying ""I just don't want to be with you anymore."" I was devastated. I cried the entire way down to the beach.


When I'm there I get a long email from him saying how we aren't right for each other. He wants to be selfish, so that he can focus on work and school and not fight with me all the time. That I'm a great person but this is for the best. I didn't want to deal with any of this, so I never responded to the email. 


After a day, he starts texting me because I haven't responded. His texts are mean and hurtful calling me a child, that I'm the most selfish person on the planet, that I have a god complex, how could I do this to him and not respond, that I'm an asshole and stupid, that if I don't say anything by the end of the day he'll make sure I never hear from him again. 


I gave in and responded to this texts in which he continued to yell at me and call me names. And I was reading these texts, enjoying time with my family, in a beautiful place.... I just didn't want to do it anymore. I am done being yelled at. So I blocked his number and email address. And it felt so good. 


I may never know if he cheated, but this whole thing wasn't even really about that. It was about his emotional and verbal abuse of me over the last year and a half of my life. How he stripped me of my confidence and made me not like who I was. How he convinced me I was stupid and mean and a bad person to the point where I didn't want to exist anymore. He made me small. And for that I don't know if I can forgive him. 


Its been a few days and my friends who have distanced themselves because of him are back and its been nice to hang out with them again. I'm going to start working out again and focus on rebuilding what I have lost from this relationship. 


Thank you reddit, for helping me see what the fuck was going on and that I don't deserve this. When I'm feeling sad I often go back to my original post and read everything you all wrote and it helps. So thank you. You saved me from him but most of all you saved me from my broken self.

So, it's been about four months since my ex wife abandoned our family. At first I was terrified of being an only parent. I didn't know what I was going to do, how I was going to make it through the next day, I was a wreck. After some time I've come to feel better about my situation. My sons and I are adjusting to life without my ex and things are looking up. I've gotten a promotion at work, my kids had a great winter break, life is settling into a good place. Until I have to deal with my ex.

Shortly after my first post I decided to go ahead and file for divorce. In the paperwork she agreed to give me full custody of the kids and wanted nothing except her car and a few things she took when she moved out. (TV, bed, etc..). My state requires there to be child support in the divorce documents, so she signed them assuming I wasn't actually going to ask her to pay. That was my original intention, she had said that she wanted to be a part of our kids lives. So I thought as long as she's around I don't want her money. In the four months since she left she's seen our kids a total of two hours. She hasn't spoken to my youngest in over two months, and my oldest since before Christmas. My oldest son has a messaging app on his tablet that she could talk to him through, shortly before Christmas she told him she would set up a day for them to visit her. She never followed through on that, so I confronted her about it and told her I didn't want her talking directly to him if she was going to be raising his hopes and not following through.

Since my ex moved out she's dated two married men, the second is also in the middle of a divorce and she's still dating him. She's left her job and started working at a different call center. She hasn't paid any child support. And never asks to see our kids, unless I've initiated a conversation. Then she asks about them only as an afterthought, and never sets up an actual visit. My youngest son will be turning five on Friday, and I'm honestly not expecting to hear from her. It would honestly shock me if she called. She has basically turned her back on us, as if we never existed.

Our divorce should be finalized this month. And I've already gone to recovery services to get her to pay the child support. It's been a hard few months but I feel confident that things will be ok.

I want to thank everyone for their advice. Everyone (um...mostly everyone) was very helpful and it was validating to hear people say my mother-in-law had behaved badly. 

Yesterday morning my mother-in-law called my husband while he was at work. She said she wanted to come back to the house to apologize (seriously didn't expect that). My husband told her he needed to check with me first. I told him it was fine as long as he and my sister-in-law were there too.

So last night after my husband came home MIL and SIL came over. I was pretty nervous but I tried not to show it. MIL apologized for her behavior. She said she *knows* that Sarah is her son's daughter and that I am, in her words, ""a good girl."" She said that she is disappointed that we aren't including Indian culture in Sarah's life. We gave her a completely Western name (except the last name) and we didn't have any religious ceremonies for her, including the traditional Hindu baby naming ceremony.

I feel I need to tell you all that this was a mutual decision between me and my husband. My husband was born and raised here and is very Westernized. While his given name is very Indian he has a Western nickname he prefers to go by. We live in the American south and he deals with casual (and not so causal) racism on a regular basis. He has been pulled over by the police repeatedly for ""looking suspicious"" and even occasionally harassed at work. He doesn't want that for our daughter so when we decided on a name he was clear that giving her an Indian name was not something he wanted to do. We are also both atheists and didn't want to do the traditional ceremonies from either of our familys' religions.

Anyway, my MIL said she dealt with the Western name and the lack of a ceremony but when she saw the baby even *looked* white she freaked out. She reiterated that she doesn't doubt Sarah's paternity and that she's sorry she acted that way. She said she very much wants to be a part of Sarah's life. 

I thanked her for her apology but I also told her how what she did made me feel. I told her that I had really valued our relationship and had been looking forward to her relationship with Sarah but that I'm worried now. I told her she behaved in a way that made me question her ability to spend time with Sarah alone. But, I said, if she wanted to she could prove to me that this was a one time incident. 

I told her that my husband and I had discussed letting Sarah stay with her one weekend a month when she gets older. On these weekends my mother-in-law would be more than welcome to take Sarah to her temple and teach her all about Indian culture and the Hindu religion if she wanted to. However, as of now that is no longer the plan. If my MIL wants that privilege back she needs to behave like an adult and treat both of us with respect. She agreed and told us she loves us both. We hugged and she cried a little. She asked to see the baby and cried full on when she held her. She cooed at her in Hindi (my husband said it was all sweet things) and promised us that she would earn our trust back. She then asked if we would reconsider the baby naming ceremony. We agreed that if she wanted to plan it we would do it. We aren't thrilled with that but we are happy that things are working out. 

I will be proceeding with caution but I am optimistic. Her apology was sincere and (it appears) not coerced. She won't be left alone with Sarah any time soon but if she continues to be the warm, loving, and *sane* woman we knew her to be before this nonsense then a year or two down the road everything will be the way it's supposed to be.

Beforehand, she said she wouldn't be too long at it, and would text me when she was leaving. There was inclement weather last night so I asked her to do this so I knew she wasn't upside down in a ditch somewhere.

Well, several hours go by, no word from her. At this point, I'm a little worried. I texted her sister(who also happens to be close associates of my SOs boss) and asked if she heard from my SO at all during or before the party. She said "" her boss said that party was canceled because of the weather, I know he was going out to dinner with someone though."" This is when my heart sank.

I got nervous, and decided to open up her email and she if maybe she made any other plans around this time. The first email that popped up was from her boss forwarding her the reservation details for their ""Christmas party"", specifically they were meeting up at a couple of bars in a city an hour away and then heading to a very expensive restaurant for a ""very private evening"".

At that point, I knew something was up, but reasonably, there was nothing I could do about it, so I went to sleep. She got in around 130 in the morning stumbling around in the dark, so I know she got drunk or did drugs with this guy.

I woke up this morning, and in the bathroom were her clothes from last night. I'm not proud of this, but I checked her pockets and found  nothing. But I noticed that her panties were bunched up under all of the other clothing, and when I picked them up, they reeked of sweat and sex. They also had, for lack of a less blatant term, sexual residue on them and obvious sperm stains.

So yeah, that's where we're at now. I never got the suspicion that she was unhappy in any way, and she even constantly complained about her work so I thought everything was kosher.

What do, /r/relationships?

**tl;dr** SO appears to have gone out and slept with boss last night during a "" company event"". No indication that she was ever unhappy in the relationship.


**EDIT**: I posted a semi update in the thread, but here it is:

""I don't know why I really even posted this in here, to be honest. I guess I just needed a push to do what I know I need to do, which is leave her cheating ass. So, for that, thanks guys.

I just don't get why she would do this. I've been the best boyfriend I can be, I've been super supportive of her hobbies and her career(...) and loved her with all of my heart.

The good news is she isn't on the lease and I don't pay for any of her bills, but her shit is everywhere in our apartment, so her packing up will take a while. I will not be helping her with this.

I sent her a text that says ""*I know what happened last night. If you want to talk about it at all, your only chance will be at [restaurant]. I'll be there from 12 to 1 exactly. Show up if you want, if not, it doesn't matter to me. After that, consider us over and consider yourself evicted.*""

The kicker to all of this is that her boss owns the company, I forgot to mention that bit. So, HR? Not happening, he is HR. He's also unmarried. Just a creepy asshole.

If she shows up to lunch, I'll update you guys on what happens. If not, I'll update you guys anyway.
Thanks for the push <3""

**EDIT 2**: The lunch update. Oh boy:

""Whoa, this took off. Thanks for tuning into the spectacle that is my love life as of late, folks.

As for the lunch update, it was not really as expected. I expected lots of tears shed, maybe some bargaining, but what I got was none of that.

When she came into the restaurant, she was calm and collected. She almost looked proud, even. When she sat down, I looked at her for a few seconds and said ""Well, what do you have to say for yourself?"" What I got was more than I bargained for.

In a nutshell, she cheated because she wanted to. That was it. She wanted different dick, and her exact words were ""It got boring between us and I wanted something new, I knew what I was doing."" I asked her if she got drunk that night and she said ""Of course I did, I got more drunk than I've ever been in my life ever."" I asked her if she intended to hurt me and she said ""on the surface, no, but I guess somewhere deep inside, subconsciously, yes."" I asked her how long this had been going on and she said ""last night was the first night we had sex, but we've been messing around ever since I started there."" Which was a year ago. Good, just good.

At this point, I knew she was out for blood for whatever god forsaken reason. There was no point to this charade any longer, and I wanted out of there before I got hurt even more. I didn't intend to finish my meal, so I leaned over and said ""you have until tonight to get your shit out of my place, or it's on the curb, and I mean every last piece of it."" And then left.
Here I am at work now. It's almost surreal to have one of the cornerstones of my life just erode in a matter of hours. Soon the emotions will start, and that's when the real fun will begin.""",1420806010.0,I[23M] think my SO[22F] cheated on me with her boss[50'sM] last night,0.94
617,gfloan,Relationships,4mi3bc,2005,"My gf of 1 year asked me for a loan of $1000, I said no.

We've been together a year, we live separately though.  We each have our own apartments.

She currently doesn't have a job, although she claims to be looking for one.  She kind of has a hectic lifestyle, she spends a lot of money.  She goes out a lot, eats out a lot, buys many things she doesn't need such as expensive clothing, when she should be buying things more affordable.  She spends money on coffee at cafes every day.

She's borrowed money from her parents before and has never managed to pay them back, basically just squandered them.  Now its come to a point where even her parents refused to lend her money cause they know they'd be basically enabling her poor spending habits and they know they'd never see that money again.

Frankly, I feel the same. I feel if I lend it to her, its as good as gone.  I told her I feel there's a lot more she could do to save money, she could move out and live somewhere more affordable, she could intensify her job hunting and maybe work something that she might otherwise consider 'beneath her' until she makes enough money.  I mean, lots of restaurants always have spots available for waiters or kitchen staff, I don't see why she can't just pick up a minimum wage job for the time being instead of going out every day and going to clubs wasting her parents money.

I told her she could be better budgeting herself, i.e. on what she eats, what she wears, where she lives, how much she spends, and she wouldn't have as severe money problems.  She accused me of lecturing her and got angry, I told her she was the one who came to me for help with money.  She just wanted me to hand her over a $1000 to ""borrow"" which she'll definitely totes absolutely pay back (probably never).

I told her, honestly, I feel if I lend her the money, I don't think she'll be able to pay it back.  She told me she will, she has a plan, I should just trust her.  I also pointed out I don't like lending out money to family and friends because it causes a constraint on our relationship when they can't pay it back.

She was like ""oh but you lent $1000 to your sister in the past"".  I said yes, because then I knew I could trust her to properly budget herself, she had a job at the time, and I trusted her to be able to pay it back, which she did.

Its caused a lot of strain and resentment within our relationship, I'm really not sure what to do.  I don't want to pay her the money, I think she should make adjustments to her living style and stop living beyond her means.   The fact that her parents have now flat out refused to just hand her over money I think says a lot about their level of trust for her. Any advice on what I should do or how to handle this?

So i'm updating so I can leave this story behind and move on. Thanks for all the advices.

After reading all the answers I just decided to verify if he really does have lunch with his parents on mondays (and ended up doing almost everything proposed). This morning I called his mom to ask if i could join them today and she was exalted. I didn't tell him I was coming and he was really happy to see me there.

We had lunch at his parents' house which is where they usually eat. In the end, I managed to verify without going behind his back and alerting his parents. At one point during lunch I said ''It's awesome how you have this monday tradition'' or something like that and his mom just kept going on about how it was a way for them to catch up with each other, they(him and his siblings) are so busy all the time, and to share some family time. She lamented the fact that his older sister often couldn't make it to their lunch because of her unpredictable schedule. I got invited to join the tradition but declined since this is their time to be with their son, and I don't want to intrude on that. Honestly it felt really comfortable, and I felt like a part of his family so I had a great time.

Mike indeed does have lunch with them every mondays. We decided to clear his name once and for all this afternoon and he downloaded whatsapp again on his phone.The last messages he exchanged with her were from 3 months ago (maybe some got deleted automatically?). They barely communicated through whatsapp. I did not see any hole in the conversations and most were about me anyways, like ''Have you see MikenVic? She is not answering her phone"" and stuff like that. On her phone there was a profile picture when she showed me the texts but his was blank and he said he never put one. Which is weird but that's his type. She tends to contact him first but she just does that to everyone anyways and there was nothing flirty, just ''hello'', ''hey''. When we were finished he asked me if I was feeling better now and to just come to him if I have other doubts. This afternoon he reminded why I am so attached to him with his care. He didn't get defensive at any time and even left me with his phone as I was still searching (tried to gps thing but nothing came out)  when he went to buy some cake with his mom. He teased me about putting a keylogger on his phone...


I feel reassured and hope Kim will stay away from us now. A part of me wonders just why did she invent this whole story???? But I would rather keep this question unanswered than to bring drama into my relationship again.


**tl;dr**: I had lunch with his parents who unknowingly confirmed he is there every monday. We looked into his phone again but found nothing suspicious. I had a great time and love him even more.

619,shouldbutIdont,Infidelity,43ja4t,1999,"Right, where to begin?

The STBXW and I were together for over 25 years, 22 of those married. 

Prior to this, there were no infidelities or large problems.

We have 4 children: a pair of twins (boy and girl) 20 years old, a son that's 19 and our youngest daughter is 15.

I filed for divorce mid-December and had her move out of our home and back with her parents. Got a lot of voice mail left and emails and even hand-written letters about how sorry she is about what she's done, but I never replied in any way. When it finally dawned on her I was really going through this and there was nothing she could do to stop it, she attempted suicide. 

In all likelihood, she would have died had her parents not stayed at home to keep an eye on her. 

From what I've been told, she tried to overdose on pills, but no one knows where she got them in the first place. 

Her infidelity apparently became fully physical only recently (late November or early December), but even before that she was emotionally cheating for at least a few months before that. I don't care to find out how long since it wouldn't really help me in any way. 

Since it was a married man with whom she had the affair, I'd notified his wife, so he's getting divorced too.

Add to that, they're co-workers, which is how they met in the first place, and I assume they used work time to start the affair.
 
For those that are going to ask ""How did you find out?"" the answer is ""I didn't"". Our son and daughter (the twins) did. They saw their mother kissing with the other man, in public (the place in question isn't somewhere where any of us usually pass through) and then they proceeded to inform me. 

I started digging around and found more than enough evidence of a prolonged affair.

I don't have many dealbreakers, and believe that marriage is something that's a continuous work in progress. You have to do your part to keep it alive and well, but cheating is something that I absolutely will not overlook or forgive. To cheat is to take a shit on all the time you spent together, to take a dump on your shared lives. 

It's nothing more than selfishness and cruelty. 

I'm just telling you so you can understand me a bit better. Maybe, but that's a really, really reaching 'maybe', I could have tried to look past this if it had been a one-time thing and she immediately came to me, contrite and remorseful. But she wasn't. I mean, she only started sobbing and bawling once she got caught and that to me is utterly worthless. It's easy to cry once your shit is put into the spotlight, but before all this? I've never noticed anything remorseful about her or any sign of guilt.
 
I just can't live with someone like that.   

Thankfully, all of the kids were supporting and understanding when I told them I was going to divorce their mother. Our youngest cried more than I did, but said I was doing the right thing, for all of us. She did ask me if she could live with me (the other three already have places of their own, by their own choice) and I told her she didn't even have to ask.
 
I think that's the best thing in this situation overall, just having the kids there showing me not all of those years being with my wife were a waste. Whatever she's like now, I can at least be grateful for our children, if nothing else. 

I love them more than anything.

Unfortunately, nearly everyone we know, barring the friends who were my friends before they became the family's, are trying to get me to stop the divorce and talk to her, go into counseling or some other nonsense. More so after the suicide attempt.

Needless to say, all those people are on my shitlist and I've cut all forms of communication with them. Sadly, that includes the in-laws, whom I've really loved before all this happened since I'm an orphan myself and saw them as the family I never had. They tried getting to me through their grandkids, which has soured them on visiting their grandparents in the near future. The kids tell me they love them, but they just can't be around them at this time because they're being so overbearing.

They've also chosen to distance themselves from their mother, though they're still in touch obviously. 

I'm in therapy myself, going through some counseling because for all that's happened I feel nothing. When I look back at finding out about all this, I see the lack of rage and hurt is very worrying. My therapist says I've numbed myself on purpose, to help me get through this easier. I don't know. Before all this, if anyone asked me how I felt about my marriage and wife, I'd probably tell them I as happy as I could be, with a big smile on my face. 

Now? Nothing. When I heard about the suicide attempt, you might as well have told me the weather forecast for the day. I didn't feel anything. Not for me personally, anyway. I was angry, in a way, as to what this could have done to our children, but beyond that her trying to kill herself just doesn't get a reaction out of me. 

I'm not happy that she's realized how much she's ruined our lives, but I'm not feeling any sort of empathy either. I can't. It's just that I look at the situation and think ""Yes, and? How is that any concern of mine?"" 

I'm not like that. Or at least I don't think I was like that before all of this. And my therapist assures me the numbness will pass, it's part of the healing process, but here we are, more than a month later and I still feel nothing about what happened. 

I'm honestly not sure if that's good or bad. I'll just have to wait and see. 

As to the rest of my life, the friends that stayed true to me aren't letting me spend much time alone. They understand that I do need some time for myself every now and again, but they don't want me too alone. It all seems so different now, you know?

Now, my main concern here is about our kids. For now, they're keeping away from her, of their own free choice. I didn't poison them against their mother or anything of the sort, they just don't want to talk to her much at all. Our youngest has been hit the hardest by her mother's infidelity, and I've been thinking of maybe having her see go for some therapy too, if we can't resolve this on our own. 

This is what really bothers me about the whole thing, that our children reacted so severely to their mother's infidelity. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't glad that they did react negatively to it, because it goes to show that they understand that adultery is no small matter and that it can, like it has for us, destroy marriages and families. But I'm worried about long term.

Will they get over this? Will they eventually form a tangible relationship with their mother? Will they heal? 

If any of you folks have been in any situation as similar as ours, please share your experiences.

Thanks to all of you who commented and gave advice on the last post. Having the little extra support was nice. 

The day after I made the post I basically already had my mind made up to leave my fianc? (I'd been thinking about it longer than I'd like to admit), but I decided to wait until the holidays were over so that the break wouldn't be as messy. 

We were discussing Christmas plans and I told him that I would prefer to go to my family's house this year because I knew that If I joined his family, his brother/SIL and their boys would be there and id rather not disturb the boys schedule or get yelled at by his family anymore. 

My fianc? flipped his shit and began yelling at me for being selfish and thinking only of myself.  I even told him why again and he still kept yelling, all while name calling, and I lost it and started yelling too and told him that I might want to spend time with his family if I wasn't abused and forced against a wall every time I was near them. 

Apparently this was the most shocking news ever to him and he couldn't believe that I felt that way. 
When he finally asked how I was being abused, I told him about all of the things his family does and says to me (even though usually while he's present) and maybe I shouldn't have, but I also told him that I didn't want to be hit/kicked/spat on/groped by the boys for at least this one day. He, somehow had no idea that I wasn't okay with this (!) despite the fact that he witnesses it and I tell him every time it happens. 

He called me an ""awful  cunt'' for ""blaming them for doing things that they don't know aren't okay/that go along with their disabilities"" and ""having no sympathy for selfless (!!!!!) people in a physically/emotionally tough situation"" which isn't at all what came out of my mouth in any way, shape, or form (and he knows that I know that the boys can't help it and that I've expressed both sympathy and understanding for his brother/SIL). 

He left very soon after that and immediately the phone calls (and messages)  started coming in from his family.  I can't even count how many worthless/useless/selfish/evil/ pathetic, bitches/whores/and cunts I was called.  Then they even took it to Facebook and fabricated the story completely and twisted just about every word. 

My fianc? came back the next day and apologized for the night before and asked if I was ready to suck it up and get over myself and just go to his family's house for Christmas. I stuck to my guns and told him that there was no way I was going back there and that I was spending the holidays with my family whether he was going or not and we got into another fight (solely about our relationship this time).  And I told him about all of his selfishness, immaturity (in everything), disrespect (lying, name calling, purposely doing/saying things I'd asked him not to) whininess (whenever I wanted to go out with friends or family or have time by myself he would pout and moan and groan and whine and call a billion times asking when I'd be home), and his total lack of balls when it came to defending me ever.

We went back and forth for quite a while and at one point I was finally done and kicked him out (it was my house to begin with) and told him that our relationship was over. 

Even after all of that, it was hard to leave him and i will sort of miss him at times, but it felt like the biggest weight in the world had been lifted off of my shoulders and for the first time in the 4.5 years we'd been together I felt like a free person. 

I still feel bad for his family though, and especially the boys, knowing what they have to go through, but I had to get out as it was only adding extra, unneeded stress and hurt to everyone.

It's still a mess right now with him having to come back and forth and get his belongings and canceling everything for the wedding, but I'm happy that it's over now and that I can move on and not feel completely awful about myself 24/7, even though my heart is still a little broken.

 - After my original post, my dad sent a message to my wife's best friend, basically saying that she had spun the story in the opposite direction to make him look like the bad guy. He told her that he thought the call would remain confidential between them, since he asked her not to tell my wife and I about it. If it was supposed to be private, maybe that call shouldn't have been made at all...

 - My wife and I received an email from my mom, stating that my parents are shocked and saddened that we confronted them about contacting my wife's friend to ask about us. There was no apology, no acknowledgement of overstepping, or anything to accept that they broke a boundary. She said *we need to treat each other with respect* and this should be solved by having a face to face meeting between my parents, me, and my wife. (we originally emailed them to avoid an in-person meeting which would lead to over-emotional and overreacting responses) Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents. *(note: our daughter passed away after birth last year; my mom saying this only made this situation worse)*

 - My brother has called me too, and has made it clear that he's surprised that my wife and I are reacting this way. He was asking me several questions and I eventually realized that it seems he has taken my parents' side in this scenario.

 - Latest: my dad has texted my wife and I to say that he will eventually be emailing us his side of the story, and why he originally called my wife's best friend.

Thank you for the countless responses last week and all of the supportive and helpful comments. I'm no longer questioning that my parents have intruded too far, and am now looking back realizing a history of seeing this behavior from them. The next step is trying to accept that it's not on me to try and fix this. My wife said she doesn't see a relationship ever healing between her and my parents; I personally don't want to cut them out of my life completely, but after this it's probably going to be much different. It's difficult not knowing what the next days/weeks will be like - currently it sounds like they are going to remain ignorant to their own actions.

Hello everyone.  I was going to update this last night but then I got drunk and forgot.  Thank you for all the wonderful replies I was so overwhelmed I stopped responding.  I thought I should address some questions and concerns before moving on with the update.

For those of you talking about 'bro code', it wouldn't apply here.  Greg and Emily were my friends before I even met my husband. I knew them both in college.  I was actually a bridesmaid at their wedding and the godmother of their newest baby.  And the reason I didn't go out for drinks with them was because I was watching their two other children.  So it would be like breaking bro code if Greg didn't tell me kind of?

Onto the update. I stopped by the car repair place we always go to, and the one he said he used when I was in the hospital.  They had no record of working on our car at that time.  Not even a tire change or oil change or axle adjustment or anything.  So my husband was definitely lying about it because they said at that price they'd always have some sort of record.

I went to confront him the other night.  Long story short, he didn't deny any of it.  He wasn't sorry about it either.  He fessed up to hiring the escort and to having sex with her.  He said it wasn't cheating because it was a service, not like he fell in love with another woman.  It was just sex to him.  I also asked him about STIs and he said he didn't even think of that.  So off I go to get tested because of my husband's stupidity and cheating.

I should say my future ex husband though.  I cannot trust him and the fact that he didn't think he did anything wrong disgusts me.  Once he knew that I knew, he wasn't even defensive anymore.  He wasn't sad or angry.  He just seemed like he didn't even care.  Like he was apathetic about our whole marriage.  Everything I thought I knew about him was wrong and I'm trying to figure out how he tricked me so well.

I called a divorce lawyer and am currently staying in our guest room because I don't even want to look at him.  I'm going to see the lawyer next Wednesday and figure out where to go from there.  Oh, also, I got Greg a thank you gift.  He's now subscribed to meat of the month for a whole year.  Thanks for all your support through this guys.

623,rudemanchildguest,Non-Romantic,53dse9,1986,"**Background:** I?ve known my best friend, Nicole, since freshmen year of college (10 years ago). She met Mike her senior year. They married two years ago and have a son together. 

Nicole is incredibly laid back, incredibly go-with-the-flow. She?s friendly, bubbly, has never been high maintenance or demanding of attention. I was initially wary of Mike because he came off as undeservedly cocky and self-centered. One of those people that walks into the room while blasting his own personal WWE entrance song in his head. But he made her happy and he was utterly devoted to her, so I figured that was good enough. We?ve lived in different cities since we?ve graduated, so I only see Nicole and Mike a few times a year.

As additional background, my girlfriend and I have been together a year, and we just got a house together. She and Nicole clicked immediately, but she has spent minimal time around Mike.

**The rest:** Nicole and Mike stayed at our house this weekend because the college football team they support was playing our local team, and they had tickets to the game. 

The gf and I were bracing for Mike?s tendency to dominate the conversation this weekend, but we weren?t anticipating just how insufferable he would become. It was a painful two days, and I was glad to see them leave this morning.

 Some examples of his behavior:

* **His football team lost, and his whiney attitude put a damper on the entire night.** I?m a football fan. I get it. I?m a bit mopey when my team loses, too, especially the way his team lost (They were highly ranked and favored and lost in a big way - if you follow college football, you can probably guess what game I?m talking about). But he pouted about it - loudly and often - the entire night. The gf and I were watching the other games on TV when Mike and Nicole got back from theirs. He stormed in the door, immediately grabbed two beers from the fridge, flopped down on the entire length of the couch and ranted about the loss for a good 15 minutes. He?d then flip between ranting about the loss during every lull in the conversation to sulking quietly while he sprawled across the couch, forcing Nicole and my gf to sit on the floor (We just moved in, so we?re still short on furniture). The conversation could never last for more than five minutes without Mike interjecting his disgust with his team?s loss. Funny enough, every time he?d leave to pout in the other room, Nicole, my gf and I would get super chatty and have a great time laughing and joking. Then he?d come back in, stamping around petulantly, interrupting whatever we had been talking about, and the general mood would immediately sour. He?d talk about how inconsolable he was each time he tipped back a new beer or smoked another bowl. He told us a half-dozen times the exact scenario that could play out for his team to still make the playoffs. He even started ranting about the game to strangers next to us at dinner. Five hours later.


* **He was abrasive towards all three of us, but most of all his own wife.** Whenever we ladies would tease each other, we'd all share in the laughter, but the moment anyone would say anything resembling teasing towards him, he'd get super loud and defensive. He'd throw a tantrum and Nicole would have to continually apologize or explain what ""we really meant"" and how it wasn't meant to be offensive. For example, Mike was raving about his peach cobbler old-fashioned at dinner - which was a welcome break from his boo-hooing about the game. I told him I'm glad he found a happy place, and Nicole mumbled something in agreement. He stared her down and said, ""BETTER? What do you MEAN I'm 'BETTER'?"" She looked a bit taken aback and clarified that she meant he must be feeling better. Later in the night, Nicole sat on Mike's lap on the couch and invited me to sit on her lap so my girlfriend could take a picture of all three of us. As I was attempting to position myself for the photo, Mike said, ""You're covering my face."" As I continued to adjust, he yelled: ""YOU'RE COVERING MY FACE!"" then shoved me off of them.



* **He made inappropriate and embarrassing comments about his and Nicole?s sex life.** The more Mike drank, the more he'd switch between making passive-aggressive comments about his sex life and feeling up on Nicole. He'd talk about blue balls and needing sex and how he wished Nicole would wear sundresses because girls look good in them. It's like he took advantage of every opening he had to make a quip about their sex life. He also took every opportunity he could to grope Nicole, even going so far as to putting his hand down her shirt collar mid-conversation. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to take out her contacts, she overheard him begging Nicole for sex in the guest bedroom. My girlfriend said the more Nicole pushed back, the whinier Mike got. 


* **He?d lash out if we didn?t react to something he said the way he wanted us to.** Whether it was a crude comment or a so-called sarcastic quip he'd make or his demand to go play Pokemon Go! the entire night (We played it to and from dinner both nights) or his inability to handle losing rounds in Cards Against Humanitiy, he'd make a scene every time something didn't go his way. He asked if we could go back to the Slushee shop we stopped at on Friday to get more alcoholic Slushees, and then added only if I ""stopped being such a *bi-atch*"" and drank with them since I didn't the night before (I declined, though I encouraged them to drink, and he still looked personally offended that I didn't want to). When we were all sharing bites of the side dishes we all ordered at dinner, he made fun of my braised kale (it was braised with bacon, for goodness sakes) and told me he'd stick with his ""shitty mac and cheese."" As if me ordering kale instead of make and cheese was a personal affront to him. 
 

* **He single-handedly smashed the weekend?s worth of beer and snacks meant for all of us.** I bought two bags of chips and a 24 pack of beer for the weekend. He slammed 18 of those beers and left nothing but crumbs from the two bags of chips. This complaint might be petty - after all, I did buy those things for our consumption - but I can?t imagine being a guest in someone?s home and cleaning out the entire weekend?s supply of snacks/drinks by myself. The cherry on top came when he he polished off his second drink at dinner (his 12th drink of the day) and suggested that I might need to go out and get some more beer because ?we? were almost out. 

I realize there?s probably nothing truly damning here. He didn?t trash the house. He didn?t clean out our whole pantry - just the snacks we bought. In fact, he actually fixed a leak that sprung under the kitchen sink while the gf and I were out for a walk Saturday morning. 

But added up all together, it was an exhausting and frustrating weekend.

It got to a point on Saturday night where the gf excused herself to run to an ATM. When she had been gone a half hour, I texted her to make sure she was OK. She responded, ?I can?t stand Mike. I just need a minute to myself.? For context, my girlfriend has one of the most easy-going personalities I?ve ever known. She also works in a customer service industry where she manages dozens of employees with different personality types in a high-stress environment. So it?s pretty hard to faze her. 

Last night when we laid down for bed, we agreed neither of us would be comfortable with him in our home again.

Which brings us to the crux of the situation: How do I begin to approach my best friend about this? If she wants to come visit again, how do I possibly tell her her husband is not welcome? She would come to our defense whenever he?d channel one of his micro-aggressions towards us, but it?s not like they?re getting a divorce over it. So this problem won?t be going away.

Are my girlfriend and I overreacting? We aren?t in college anymore. We?re all either 30 or approaching it. In fact, their relationship in general seems pretty unhealthy, but that?s an entirely different conversation. (Though I?d welcome advice on that, too, if it comes to that.) 

**tl;dr:** Girlfriend and I hosted my best friend and her husband this weekend. Husband acted like all of the rotten children from Willy Wonka combined. We don?t want him back in the house. Asking for advice on how to navigate what will eventually be a difficult conversation.

--------------------------------------

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, everyone. I appreciate the advice and the support. It looks like the concern here is less about addressing this weekend and more addressing this type of behavior in their relationship in general. I know from past nights of drinking with them that this wasn't a one-time behavior. He's acted like this before, only in smaller, less intense doses. 

I want to make sure she's OK and happy (if that's possible after what I observed?!). Nicole kind of opened the door when she texted me, ""Sorry Mike was so abrasive and obnoxious last night...I didn't realize he drank as much as he had,"" earlier this afternoon. My girlfriend uses reddit and has also been monitoring this thread, and we decided that I'm going to start that conversation with Nicole tomorrow morning - during work hours so I know he won't be lurking over her shoulder. 

I know that^ ^ ^ response might have seemed obvious from the get-go, but as I said to one of the commenters: Because Nicole is so laid-back, we've had a relatively breezy friendship and have never had to confront a tricky subject like this one. So as odd as it might sound, this is pretty unfamiliar territory for us.

--------------------------------------

**UPDATE:** I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to offer your thoughts and advice. I read every comment. Some of you thought my girlfriend and I could have done a better job standing up to Mike. While there were definitely some situations we could have handled better or firmer, I wanted to clarify that, overall, we didn't just let him roll over us. Every time he blatantly disrespected one of us, someone (whether it was me or Nicole) stood up to him. 

We also tried to make the weekend as inclusive for everyone as possible. I'm aware that Mike was, literally, the odd man out, so we tried to accommodate what everyone wanted to a reasonable degree. Mike wanted to get alcohol Slushees on Friday, so we got alcohol Slushees. Mike wanted to play Pokemon Go!, so we made sure to play to and from our walks to dinner both nights. Other times, he wanted to do something that no one else wanted to do (like have dinner at 4 p.m. or go back for more alcohol Slushees on Saturday), so we wouldn't. 

Also for the record, neither my girlfriend nor I hate men. It's just one man's actions in particular that rubbed us the wrong way. I got a good laugh out of that accusation, though. 

On to the update:

After spending Sunday evening talking with my gf about how to address this tactfully, I messaged Nicole this morning. I wanted to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't want to jump to any conclusions about the nature of their relationship, but I wanted to be sure Nicole knew the door would be open if she ever felt uncomfortable with the way he talks to her when he's drunk (or sober, for all I know!)

I wish I had a more interesting update, but the talk went how I thought it'd go. No earth-shattering revelations.

Like I said in my edit, Nicole had texted me the night before apologizing for Mike's behavior. So I used that as an opening.

**Me:** Sorry I didn't get back to you last night. But I just wanted you to know... You shouldn?t feel the need to apologize for Mike. I do have to admit he made both of us pretty uncomfortable this weekend, but that is not your fault nor is it something you should be apologizing for. It was important to us you both had a good time, and I hope you did. I was worried if you were happy the whole time. I want you to know you can talk to me if he ever makes you unhappy or uncomfortable because some of the things he said to you this weekend makes me worry he isn't treating you correctly. I love you and I miss seeing you, and I want you to know that the door is always open if you need to talk.

**Nicole:** What did he say that made you concerned for me?  Because I promise I couldn't be happier.  I think he just really wants you to like him, but he gets weird and awkward and tried too hard. Plus the alcohol didn't help anything.

Based on that response, I didn't see a point in belaboring the issue. Even *if* there are deeper issues in their relationship, it's clear that talk wouldn't be happening now. But hopefully, there aren't. Hopefully, she's being honest with me and herself. 

**So I said:** Well that's a relief! I guess there were a few moments where it seemed like he made you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I'm glad you are as happy as you could be. That's all I was worried about.

She went quiet for a half hour, and I feared that I had upset her. But she eventually responded.

**Nicole:** Yea there were a few times where I knew what he was saying was coming out totally offensive, so it made me cringe because he has the worst foot in mouth syndrome and doesn't realize what he's saying is coming out wrong.  I don't know why he gets so weird and feels like he needs to make jokes but it always makes things weird.  But you don't have anything to worry about with me.

I didn't want to push her, though I was tempted to say, ""If Mike was really sorry, why are you the one apologizing to us?"" But I didn't. So there you have it. We ended up exchanging ""It was good to see you!"" messages, and the convo kind of died there. 

Best case scenario, it was just a really, really bad weekend for Mike, but Nicole is otherwise happy, healthy and whole. Worst case scenario... well, at least she knows the door is open. So if it gets to that point, I hope she talks to me.

624,throwaway38281,Non-Romantic,368y6h,1984,"I grew up gay in a conservative household.  I kept it to myself but I'm  sure everyone knew or had a feeling I was gay.  My brother, Rick, certainly suspected from an early age, and made sure to bully me mercilessly growing up.  In high school, I started dating Mike who I married later in life. We kept it quiet but somehow Rick found out.  For the next 8 years he blackmailed me into everything from getting him pot to shaving my head threatening to tell our parents about Mike. 

Then when I was 24 I brought Mike home for Thanksgiving.  My sister was there with her husband.  Rick was there with the girl he knocked up.  I brought my ""roommate.""  I had no intention of coming out, but I think my parents knew.  It was kind of a don't-ask-don't-tell.  Everything seemed okay until Rick started drinking.  Then everything went to hell.  He said that it was wrong for our parents to have someone like me at their table.  Because I was dating Mike.  Because I was a ""faggot.""  He said he couldn't allow me to be a part of his life because I could be a ""child fucker.""  He actually said that right there in front of our grandmother.  Then he told our parents to choose.  Me and Mike, or him, his girlfriend, and their future grandkid.  My parents asked if I was gay. Mike squeezed my hand under the table and I said yes.  They asked us to leave.

Since then my contact with my family has been minimal, although I still keep in contact with my sister who reached out the next day.  My parents weren't there at my wedding.  A few years back, my mother started calling on Christmases and birthdays.  I let those calls go to voicemail. Needless to say I have not spoken to Rick. I miss my parents.  I don't miss Rick.  I ask my sister about my parents.  I don't ask my sister about Rick.

About two weeks ago I received a message from Rick over facebook.  It's a long, rambling letter of apology.  Rick says he now knows how I must have felt growing up because his son came out to him as gay.  He says he loves his son and wants to support him.  So he's a better father than he was a human being I guess.  And he says he wants me to talk to his son.  I haven't even met this boy.  I'm not his uncle.  I'm a strange gay man.  Sure I can offer him tales of overcoming bullying, but I was overcoming his own father.  I feel awkward about it.  The idea of talking to this poor boy makes me uncomfortable.  The thought of talking to Rick makes me break out in a cold sweat.  So I haven't responded but now I'm thinking I should.  Mike thinks it would be wrong of me to not help out my nephew because I hold a grudge against my brother.

What do I do?

TL;dr: My older brother bullied me for being homosexual and made my family disown me after he outed me.  We haven't spoken in 24 years.  He recently contacted me on FB because his son, who I've never met, has come out and he wants me to help my nephew. I kind of want to tell him to go to hell.  But I kind of want to help this poor kid.

Edit: It was Thanksgiving. So much for trying to vague up some details.

**ETA at 2 pm EST:** Thank you for all of the fantastic support and variety of advice. However to all those who commented regarding forgiving either my parents or Rick, please stop. It's not going to happen. There are a lot of details I left out because I wasn't seeking advice and it's just not going to happen. Like that some of the blackmail involved Rick's friends and Polaroids. And that in close to two decades I reached out to my parents numerous times, but they pretended I didn't exist They sacrificed a son for grandchildren, which I could sort of understand until Mike and I became parents and they still didn't respond to my pleas for them to meet their adopted grandchildren, even behind Rick's back. So I repeat, no chance of reconciliation.

Basically, my BF of 4 years had dumped me via text while I was out of town, and I had to return to the house and see him in order to pick up some things. He'd lately gone through some worrying changes, and I was anxious about that interaction \(among other things\).

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Thanks so much for your support and feedback on the last post! I got back to my house on Wednesday night. I decided to have the property manager standing by when I went back to the house, and also had the police non\-emergency number ready to dial on my phone, just in case. Fortunately, I didn't end up needing either.

When I walked in, the house was a huge mess. I'm a neat person, and had left the house very clean. Now there was furniture piled in various corners, piles of papers/electronics/clothes/DVDs all over the floors and tables. You couldn't even reach the bed, and I had to move several stacks/tubs of junk just to get some clothes out of my dresser. Several moving boxes had been packed up. For some reason Charlie had taken all of the books off the shelves, rather than just taking the ones he owned, and then had stacked up all of the books he deemed ""mine"" all over the floor of my office. My houseplants were also on the floor, completely dry and dying. It was pretty hard to see my home torn apart like that.

Charlie was on the back patio, grilling. I was worried from the comments on the last post that he might be drunk, but he wasn't; in fact, I didn't see any evidence of drinking at all. He was really surprised to see me, and kind of flustered, but not \(initially\) angry. I was friendly but business\-like, and told him I'd come back to get my car, my bike, and my cat, and that I planned to crash on the couch for the night and leave in the morning. I asked him if he could give me the set of keys he had to my car as well as my own house key. \(I'd originally left it behind for the cat\-sitter.\) He looked kind of upset, and went digging through a bunch of piles. He finally gave me the car key, but couldn't find my house key and said he'd mail it to me later.

I started gathering up my mail and searching for some of the things I needed, and Charlie started to do a sort of huff around/slam doors/pointedly avoid me kind of thing, which I tried to ignore. At one point he seemed to be acting friendly; he came in and made a joke about a gift I'd given him that he'd always secretly disliked. I laughed about it and then showed him a bottle\-cap fortune I'd gotten the day he sent me the breakup texts, one that said something like, ""A change of heart will lead to a new living situation."" He did not laugh at that; instead, he got kind of sour and said he hadn't had a change of heart, that I had just been misunderstanding the relationship for a while. It felt like he was trying to draw me into an argument, so I just shrugged and said okay, and went back to work.

Charlie disappeared into the other room and then suddenly came back and announced that he was going to call an Uber and get a hotel room for the night because I ""was freaking him out."" I could tell he was getting pretty agitated at this point. I just said I'd text in the morning when I was leaving, so he'd know when he could return.

I left early the next morning with my cat. We actually have two cats, but each clearly belongs to one of us: Charlie acquired one while he was living alone, and I adopted the other this year after the death of my old cat. So I couldn't take both of them with me?which was pretty fucking heartbreaking, I'll be honest. I really love Charlie's cat. I cried pretty hard when I said goodbye to him \(I'm kind of tearing up now\), and was grateful Charlie wasn't there.

I spent all of Thursday driving back to my parents.' It was clear from the state of the house that Charlie had a huge amount of work to do, since he planned to leave on Friday.

Since then, I've texted Charlie maybe 5\-6 times about various logistical stuff \(please remember to mail me my house key, can you transfer this utility to me before the end of the month, keep an eye out for a certain important document I couldn't find as you pack up, etc.\). His replies have usually just been ""okay,"" but this afternoon he got mad, saying that he had a million things to do and that I needed to stop bothering him. I told him that I was busy, too, and was sorry he was frustrated, but pointed out that he'd set the timeline himself. He announced that he was blocking me, and told me to communicate only via email.

So that's where we're at. I do know that he left today for his dad's house. I'm still worried about the state he ultimately left the house in, especially since it was such a huge disaster Wednesday night. I don't have any way of knowing what he's packed up and decided to take with him, either. The utilities are now all in my name, and I asked him to turn off the A/C & unplug the electronics before he left, but who knows. And he's still on the lease, and technically on the hook for half the rent, which he said he'd pay until I found a roommate to replace him once I get back for good?but again, who knows.

To be honest, I can't shake a bad feeling that this isn't over. But the trip is over, and I'm relieved that it went about as smoothly as it could have. Everything feels so surreal; it's almost like I haven't been able to feel heartbroken over the end of the relationship because the breakup has required so much else of me. One day at a time.

**TL;DR:** Nothing scary happened. Charlie was surprised and then upset, and ended up getting a hotel room for the night. I'm not out of the woods yet.

**EDIT:** I saw that a lot of people are recommending changing the locks. Charlie's still on the lease, and his stuff is \(I think\) still there; he told me he was just going to cram everything of his into the spare room and leave it there while he was at his dad's house. Fortunately, right now neither of us is at the house, and as soon as I get back I'll be tracking down a roommate to replace him on the lease. Unfortunately, I don't know when/if Charlie will return, but I'm hopeful that there won't be much \(or any\) time spent actually living in the house together. And once he's off the lease and I'm legally in the clear, I'll definitely be changing the locks.

Not really great at writing, so apologies in advance. I'll try to include as much info as I think is relevant but please feel free to ask me for more in the comments if I wasn't clear about something.

My wife has been jealous of a coworker at my job for some time now. Her name is Heather and she's in her early 20s, tall, pretty. Just observations as I have a pair of eyes. Heather is nice but I don't go out of my way to talk to her. We worked together on a project about 8 months ago, which is when this seems to have started. Heather, 3 other coworkers, and I were assigned to this project and so for a good month we spent much time together at work. My wife saw her one day when we were all coming out and she was picking me up to go to dinner at my parents. She immediately asked who she was and if she worked at my job. I told her she was new and was put on our project. For the entire duration of the project my wife was in a bad mood almost every day and would take every opportunity to tear Heather down, saying she was lanky or her nose was crooked or whatever. She is insecure about her height because she's 5'4 and not a ""6 foot tall glamazon"". I love my wife's height and her petite figure and tell her this every day. She is extremely gorgeous and turns heads whenever we walk downtown. But once she saw Heather was tall and not ugly she was convinced I thought she was hot.  I kept telling her she was just a colleague and that I had no interest in her. Regardless, she would greet her coldly or not at all if she saw my colleagues. Our home and jobs are located downtown so we usually walk to meet up with each other after work. My wife would start dressing up a lot more than usual when she'd come meet me and make a big show of jumping on me and stuff. She works at a very nice bakery and usually brings leftovers from work for us or people at my job. She always gave things out to everyone except Heather. 

Eventually Heather picked up on the hostility and approached me to ask about why my wife was acting that way. I simply told her I didn't know, maybe because she didn't know her as long as the other colleagues she was distant. She seemed to accept that but would no longer leave at the same time as everyone else and would either go early or hang back.

Bryan, another coworker, approached me on Friday and asked to talk to me privately. He told me he had been at lunch with Kate, the coworker in question, and she had gone to pay for the food. She left her phone on the table. It lit up with a text and he saw it was from Valerie, my wife's name. The text basically said ""Did you see him talking to her today? What did he say?"" then ""Do you think Heather is going to stay at that job long?"" When Kate came back to the table he asked her if that was Valerie as in my wife. She got a deer in headlights look and said ""Oh yea..we text sometimes. We're friends."" He said he thought it was weird because she put her phone in her purse without even checking the messages he had asked about and wanted to go.

I went home and I snooped on my wife's phone. I know it was wrong but I had a feeling that if I asked her she would deny it or become defensive and not show me the phone. There were weeks worth of texts that basically were little reports on what went on at work. If Heather talked to me, what we talked about, did she hug me goodbye, did she touch me at all, did I laugh at her jokes. Did the guys think she was hot, did I join in with them, did I look like I was flirting..

Kate was also apparently talking up Valerie at work to Heather. She made sure to mention often we were married, how great Valerie was, how long we'd been together. I even read one that said ""I told her 'Val works in a bakery. I bet if anyone tried to steal her husband she'd just chop them up and bake them in to a pie, haha!' "" which was pretty fucking creepy. 

A lot of things started coming together then. Heather was much more distant lately, she seemed hesitant to say bye at the end of the day. We used to talk casually like everyone else at work but now she would just say hi and bye mostly.

I've been sitting on this information all weekend. Today at work I could hardly look at Heather for shame of it, and I couldn't look at Kate for my disgust. I haven't been able to approach my wife about this because I just don't know how or what to say. I feel frustrated and very much weirded out. I feel gross too like I've had my every move watched without knowing it and as if just talking to a coworker is doing something wrong. 

I haven't talked to anyone else about this, not even Bryan who first mentioned it. I don't know what to do from here. I don't even know what this means for our relationship. It feels like something big has changed because I haven't been able to look at her the same way and all my interactions with her since Friday have been kind of forced and faked. I need to talk to her and figure out what to do.

Any advice would be appreciated. I feel very lost right now.

TL;DR: My wife has felt insecure about another coworker because they are tall and attractive. She has been texting with another coworker of mine who gives her reports on my interactions with the coworker my wife is jealous over. I feel betrayed and a bit sick thinking of it. I don't know what this means for us or how to proceed.

A little while ago.

Well -- I have forgiven them both, and my friend will be my maid of honor at our wedding.

Haha, no, not at all, but I couldn't resist putting that, I'm so, so sorry!

But, enough has happened where I feel most people will feel the situation is as over as I do. I'm sorry this is so long, but I want to answer as many questions as possible. So many people were either motivated or touched by my story, and I don't want them left wondering and worrying. I'm also sorry it took so long -- I don't have a computer at the moment, so I've been using my friend's at work or at her home (I used it for the original post, as well). It actually caused a little confusion and embarrassment because I forgot to log out once, but that's not relevant. 

So, after the post, the first thing I did was text my ex that I needed to work all night so I could avoid going home. I work in a lab, so I just spent all night running my experiments while talking with a friend back in my hometown. I wanted time to break away from the bills/bank/everything before I told my ex that I knew; I know this deception is wrong, but I don't regret it.

 I still didn't know what I wanted to do with our mutual friends, but many people insisted I needed someone to talk to, so I called up an old friend who hadn't yet met my ex in person on enough occasions to consider him a friend. He was like  an older brother to me growing up, and his wife like a wonderful older sister. I will call them M (big-brother friend) and W (His wife).

M is a lawyer, and so, I wanted to talk to him for two reasons, though I know every state has its own laws. But, it was good to tell someone in person, and have someone who knew me personally to tell me I wasn't wrong. W was absolutely furious for me, but M helped me calm down and set up a list of things I needed to do and get my name off of. By the end of the night, I felt ready, and I fell asleep on the couch in our neighboring lab for a few hours, until I could return to the apartment when my Ex wouldn't be home.

When I got there, I started to pack my things. I don't own very much -- most of the things are his (he likes things his way, and I never owned much in my life), so it wasn't too difficult. I also spent a few hours calling places to get my name off the various things we had both our names on. I'm ashamed to say that doing that made me break down crying on some poor person on the phone, and after that, I napped for a little while because I felt exhausted.

I awoke to knock on the door. I opened it, and there were M and W; I couldn't believe it. They'd brought their son to M's mother's, and hopped the first plane they could to me. Their son sends me cute little letters sometimes, so they always have my addresses. W started crying and hugged me, while M looked over my lease agreement, and checked with my state's laws online for a bit to get a general idea. He then took me down to my landlord's office, while W started to pack up the rest of my things.

Long story short -- it turns out the landlord really likes me. There are these little kids who belong to our downstairs neighbors that I play with and help with their homework sometimes. Turns out, those are the landlord's nieces and nephew. The landlord was very upset for me (M only told him that my Ex had found someone else and I wanted to move out) and said he would let me out of the lease. He said if I wanted to find someone to sublet (I said I felt terrible), he'd help me set that up.

I was very happy it ended so well. M made me spend the rest of the day breaking off my accounts, setting up a PO box and making sure my things got sent there, getting my things into storage, and setting up my own bank account. W suggested cleaning out the joint account out, but I only took what I knew I'd been saving up the last few months from each of my paychecks. It should be enough for me to continue living and paying off my student loans and the other things I'm still paying for. I didn't touch any other savings. We never split things one way or another, and even though over half the savings is technically mine, I just don't really want it. We also made sure the landlord saw the state the apartment was in when we left, so no one could say we broke anything.

I did decide to leave a letter, saying I'd try to help find a subletter if I could, but I wouldn't make any promises, and I would do so through the landlord, and only the landlord, and I signed it 'your ex-girlfriend'. And, though I am both a little proud and a little ashamed of this -- I did what a poster suggested as a joke and left three asparagus spears, with the last one snapped in half. I felt both terribly proud and embarrassed that I was so proud for doing that.

M and W took me to their hotel room. They got two beds, so I could have my own. They wouldn't let me pay them back for the storage or for the room, or the lunch they made me eat (I wasn't hungry, but W stuffed my face, which is good, because she was right, I did need to eat). W took my phone (they said I wasn't allowed it that night, and I agreed) and changed my facebook status to single for me while I cried myself to sleep again.

When I woke up, M and W caught me up. At first, Ex kept texting, asking where I was for an hour, but then after a while, my phone started to really blow up.

I'm glad I didn't read the messages myself, especially not as they were coming. I don't think I could have handed it. It started with ""nothing happened"", then to ""it only happened once"", to ""She seduced me"" to ""I was drunk"" to ""She raped me"" to ""I don't know why I did it"" to lots and lots of apologies mixing with anger about how could I do this to him, I was supposed to become his wife, he's done so much for me. I felt so terrible.

My exfriend also started texting, trying to tell me about the same types of things -- that he'd seduced her, he'd raped her, she was sorry, why was I such a bitch when she'd been raped, etc., etc. W wouldn't pick up their calls, and my voicemail box filled up after one voicemail (I'm glad I'm bad at deleting them, now).

A lot of people had told me to tell our mutual friends -- but I was still undecided at that point. However, this problem solved itself.

My exfriend (I think in hopes I would believe her rape story?) made a pubic facebook post, saying how my boyfriend had raped her, and thus, was why I had broken up. My boyfriend, not wanting to be accused of rape, posted a screenshot of their texts. She deleted the entire post, but some of our friends had watched the drama unfold, and, well, now everyone knows the truth, either way. I feel good I wasn't the one who said anything to anyone, though.

I started getting messages from all my friends. Offers of support, offers of places to stay, all sorts of love. Friends I haven't spoken to in years have been sending my messages with sorts of support -- people I played basketball with in middle school, people I played D&D with in high school, people I played Shadowrun with and made cosplays with in college, people I took judo with in grad school....I was getting support and sympathy from everywhere. It was very overwhelming, and I ended up crying myself to sleep again. (Haha, I've been doing this a lot.)

M and W stayed with me one more day, and paid for the hotel room for a few more days for me. I told them not to, but W said they paid, so I could live there or I could let it go to waste. After they left, some of my friends from a nearby city drove down to my hotel room with an gamecube, and I got to pay Smash Bros for a few days with them, like we had in college.

I kept my phone off, and generally put all my time and effort into my research and volunteer work. I changed my schedule up so my ex and exfriend couldn't know when/where to find me, and that worked for a while. (I'll mention this in a bit.)

At work one day, I heard a student saying how their friend was looking to switch apartments with someone. She couldn't stand her terrible roommates. They were loud, rude, obnoxious, ruined her relationships, were always dirty, etc. I've had terrible roommates, much worse than that, and I survived fine -- I could definitely manage until December, and this girl sounded like she really needed somewhere to go. So, I met up with the girl and my landlord (and then he met up with her and my ex, supposedly), and I met up with hers, and we essentially switched apartments. I don't know how my ex took this -- but my landlord made it happen, so I guess he really wanted to rent, or it really appealed to him how pretty that girl was (She is very fit and very attractive, she takes very good care of herself.).

So, I moved into this new place. I admit -- I was pretty stupid and didn't think to see it in person before signing everything, and just looked at the pictures she'd offered. M chewed me out for this later. I was still sort of in an emotional haze and just wanted a place to sleep a few hours a day that wasn't with friends.

She lived in a house with five gentlemen. She got a bedroom and bathroom all to herself, and they'd been letting her have it for a fraction of my half of the rent back in our two bedroom, one bath. They helped me move, they helped me clean up the girl's room (It was horrendous, she'd left trash and stains everywhere, and her bathroom was worse, but I've cleaned many a-bathroom in my life). When they saw I had no bed, one of them even made me take his air-mattress. (I'm fine with sleeping on a blanket on the floor, I did a lot growing up). They are all so nice -- graduate students and students, who all like video games, sports, cartoons, and comic books -- all things I love as well. They are all so nice and polite, and the rest of the house was in great shape, so I have to admit, I was really confused. I brought some treats I made at a friend's place one day, and they let me play Mortal Combat with them, and they cleared things up for me a bit.

As it turns out, the GIRL was the terrible roommate, and THEY were the ones demanding SHE leave. She tried to cause drama and fights between all these men, had been attacking the girlfriend one of them had (rest are single, but this guy's been with this girl since high school!), constantly stealing and breaking their things, constantly acting terrible if they brought any girls over and embarrassing them if they had guys over. They had asked her to leave, and she'd been making their lives even more of a hell for the past month or so. 

I called my old landlord to tell him about the state her room had been in, but he'd laughed and said my ex deserved it. I was rather shocked, but, well, I don't really know what the right thing to do anymore about this is? I don't want to talk to my ex about it, but maybe I need to warn him? I don't know. M says it's not my business, and my other friends do, too, but I feel like I'm in the wrong here.

I already love the new place I'm living in. My housemates appreciate me cooking and demanded to pay for all my groceries since I make food for everyone. They made a ""food jar"" that they put their money into, that could be used to buy food for everyone. They even have a washing machine INSIDE. It's never had to NOT leave to wash my clothes, I feel like a princess! They've let me wash their clothes, too. One day, when I thought they weren't home, I was singing along to a song and dancing and I didn't hear them come in. Instead of making fun of me, they ended up all dancing along until I noticed they were there. I couldn't stop laughing -- seeing weightlifters dancing and singing along to ""Single Ladies"" and ""All that Bass"" was too much for me. My face hurt from laughing and smiling so much that day.

Even better -- they have a dog! A gorgeous husky! My ex was allergic, but I've always wanted one SO MUCH. And they let me feed him, and walk him, and play with him, and they even let him sleep with me. He's so amazingly gentle and loving, and I have problems sleeping alone, and he makes me feel so safe.

Anyway, onto some bad -- my ex tried to show up at my work a few times when I was there, but my lab has good security, and thankfully, I had always been the one to visit his work for lunch, so none of the security here recognizes him, and wouldn't let him anywhere close. I told them later to please not let him in and thanked them for not doing so until then.

Unfortunately, the one I WAS forced to talk with was my exfriend.

She waited at one of the places where I volunteer at for an entire day, hoping I would show up, and I did. I tried to leave before she saw me, but she did, and she grabbed me and demanded I talk to her. I told her I had nothing to say, and she kept demanding I talk. I told her she wasn't the friend I thought she was, she wasn't my friend at all. I knew they'd been doing it a long time, I knew it wasn't rape, I knew they did it during the dinner, too. I broke up with him, and I'm not her friend anymore, either. I told her I wasn't going to even tell anyone, but she and my ex did that for me, and I was sorry they messed up, but she should never, ever lie about rape.

She constantly tried to cut me off and make things up, but I wouldn't budge, and in the end, she broke down crying and apologizing and begging me to still be her friend, that I was like a sister. I said a sister wouldn't have sex with her sister's boyfriend -- there was no reason in the world for that. I tried to leave, but she kept blocking my path, and I was scared if I so much as touched her, she'd charge me with assault or something. I started crying, too, because seeing her so hurt made me ache, too, despite everything.

She broke down, further, though. She admitted what I think may be the truth -- she said she was always so jealous of me and my ""happy life"". We came from the ""same place"" as kids (not true. I was extremely poor with a family involved with abuse and crime, while she had a loving middle class family. She's always made up reasons to not appreciate them and pretended they were ""abusive"" for doing things like grounding her for smoking) but I ended up ""so much better"". I do have a job I love and had a stable relationship, but overall, I'm a boring person. She goes to parties, and tries drugs, and went across Europe and Asia, and she was the one with whirlwind romances and men always wanting her (things she's said to me as examples of why her life is so fun throughout the years), and she always told me how boring I was and how she was the lucky one. So, I didn't quite understand, but I don't think I ever quite will. When my boyfriend approached her to look for rings (turns out he actually did, so I guess I have that, sort of, at least?), she just ""wanted to see what I had"" so she spent the day flirting with him, and apparently, ""practically tore his pants off"" when he dropped her off at her place. He was surprised but didn't fight it. And they both enjoyed the ""thrill"" so much it just ""kept happening."" (Seems pretty premeditated, considering they planned when/how to meet up, but okay.) She also then admitted she just went to the doctor and found out she's two months pregnant and doesn't know what to do.

I started crying a lot harder, but all I told her was good luck with her pregnancy, but I wasn't, and was never going to be, her friend again, and then I just kept apologizing. Thankfully, someone at the center heard me crying and came over, and it scared my exfriend away.

I called my exfriend's mother and sister, and told them my exfriend really needed them right now, and they may want to come to her place in person. I told them I couldn't help. It broke my heart, because her mother and sister were like family to me when I needed them most, but I'm not going to try and ruin a girl's reputation with her family.

I admit, I'm horribly, irrationally jealous about her being pregnant. I've wanted a baby so badly the last few years, but he said he wasn't ready, and I stayed on birth control and he used a condom, and in my friend's description she made it clear she's gotten him not to use one (I'd never tried to ask him not to, but for it to be so easy?). And at the same time, I'm so, so sad for my exfriend. She's incredibly religious, and I know being pregnant outside of marriage is destroying her. But I called who I could, and as terrible as I feel for not being there, I need to keep her away from me. I just keep reminding myself that no matter how much I'd want to help, I'm not in a state where I could, anyway. I hope that's the right way to think.

For those wondering, I have gotten tested for STDs (pretty much right away, my lab is next to a hospital that I volunteer at), and so far, I'm clear, but I'll get checked again every few months until I'm sure I don't have something like HIV. (I don't feel like my exfriend would have this, but I never imagined she'd have sex with my ex without a condom, either, so I don't know how honest she'd been to me about her previous sexual exploits anymore. Or my ex either, for that matter.)

My ex has tried to contact me through a lot of people, but none of my friends are allowing him to know where I'm living or what I'm doing, and are not agreeing to bring me his letters or other messages. He's come to my friends crying and saying he messed up, but my friends have been rather cold to him so far. I told them they don't need to hate him, but they told me I didn't get to choose that for them, and they're right. People in my last post convinced me I need to let them feel what they'll feel, and it isn't my fault.

I'm still crying constantly, questioning things and looking back -- but so, so many people have stepped up to help me. Old friends, mutual friends, new friends, a dog -- even strangers on the internet. I feel so absolutely loved and lucky. I have my work to focus on, volunteering, getting to know my new roommates/friends -- I'm keeping busy. I even mentioned going to the gym but being too shy to, and three of my roommates jumped at the chance to help me, so I've been going to the gym a bit, too. Everyone now knows about my ex and exfriend, and many have gone out of their way to make sure I don't interact with either. My friends are constantly ushering me everywhere, a few are checking my messages and texts for me, to delete any sent from unknown numbers for me (I'm in the process of just getting a new phone and phone number), I've not accepted any new friend requests after blocking both of them (except my new roommates and the girlfriend one of them has, she's been amazingly nice to me) and I have a friend also checking my ""other"" box and blocking people from there for me. I don't need to worry about nudes or anything of that sort, because I never took any (not attractive enough to warrant them, haha.)

I've blocked all non-work related e-mails from my work e-mail, and I just deleted my other old e-mail addresses and started a whole new one. They're mostly for spam, anyway.

I will admit, a few people have asked me out. And I will admit, the idea of ever dating again, ever allowing someone in like that again, terrifies me. I have set up to talk to a therapist -- I've had one when I was younger and it never helped (in fact, it made things a lot worse for a long time. Yes, I tried several therapists, yes, ones who specialize in different things, yes, ones who tried different techniques, and approaches. It just made me feel worthless as a teen when I couldn't change my outlooks), but I'm hoping it may help in this situation. I wouldn't know how to date, even if I wanted to, anyway, I've only ever been with my ex; I never thought anyone else would ever want me, nor did I ever want anyone to. So, I'm going to see if I can ever get over that. 

Overall, I'm hurt and betrayed and terrified -- but I also feel at peace and so grateful to other people. I feel like that chapter of my life is closed and a beautiful new one is beginning. I feel free. I feel happy. I feel loved.

Thank so much you everyone. I don't expect there to be anything else I need to update anyone with. :)

628,KnockedUp27,Personal issues,52rgdx,1980,"I'm 7 months pregnant with a child I plan on giving to a wonderful couple, closed adoption. I made this choice because the child was the product of non-consensual sex. I didn't press charges because I was a bit of a party-girl and didn't think I would be believed. I honestly have no idea who the guy was, I just remember trying to push him off and being to drunk to do so. 

MY choice to not press charges. MY choice to keep the pregnancy. MY choice to adopt out. I am comfortable with these choices. They are private and personal and I am keeping most of this to myself. 

My asshole friends and co-workers have turned it into a game. I was hiding the pregnancy until I started really showing a couple weeks ago. I get that people are curious about it. It's rather surprising. But I saw a betting pool being passed around the office...THEY ARE PLACING BETS ON WHO IS THE FATHER! I was shocked and a little hurt. 

My friends are also curious. I have one close friend who basically knows everything (she's going to be in the room for the birth for me) and she's not telling anyone. So, rumors are starting. One terrible rumor is that it's my (now former) friend Karen's husband Troy's baby. Karen called me in tears. I went over to her house to tell her to her face it wasn't it possible. She demanded to know the truth. I told her it was none of her business and she blasted me on fb. 

Some friends have been really nice to my face but everything gets back to me eventually. Some people are saying that I'm a paid surrogate. I guess that one is ok. I hate that people are talking about me like this. I made ONE blanket statement on fb yesterday: ""I guess I can't hide it anymore. Yes, I am pregnant. I am giving a lovely couple the child they have tried to have for years. It's very personal and private and I ask that you all respect that."" It's got a bunch of comments but I haven't read them. I'm going to take a big break from social media. 

I don't know what else to do or say. I am uncomfortable with everyone's constant questions. I LOVE my job and usually my co-workers. It's my hope that I can suck it up and go back to normal in a few months. Weirdly, I've got great inner-peace with everything because I am so happy to be giving the adopting parents (who are the kindest men I have ever met: a kindergarten teacher and a social worker) something they could never have on their own. 

Here's what I need from the readers of this sub: What can I say that isn't a lie but will shut people up without giving out information I'm not comfortable sharing? I don't like calling her (the baby is female) an 'accident'. The two people who know the whole truth (my friend and my doctor) immediately asked me why I didn't report it. I'm ashamed and humiliated. I really don't want to say much of anything. I think a big part of why this is so hard for me and those around me is that I'm usually really talkative and social. Loud-mouthed. I'm in sales so now that I'm showing I'm also dealing with these questions from strangers too. Should I go to my manager about the pool? Laugh it off? Wait for it all to blow over?

  **tl;dr**: I need to figure out what to tell people about my unplanned pregnancy in a polite but firm way that will make them stop speculating. 

**UPDATE**

Thank you so much for all the support. I'm glad I posted this. 

 I had a good cry, took an antacid (or 4) and went to the owner, Jim. I told him the truth and I told him that I really didn't want the guys to know and I needed the jokes and talk to stop because it was hurting me. He hugged me and told me he was proud of me (which made me cry again. Fucking hormones). He gathered the staff and had a quick (what he calls come to Jesus) meeting. He announced that he would fire anyone who made me uncomfortable about my pregnancy on the spot and that all the money from the pool needed to end up on my desk, pronto. He was great. He didn't share any of my personal info, he just protected me and made it quick and easy. After we disbursed, he told me I could have an additional week paid medical (I already have 2 weeks sick/vacation I haven't used). 

I am going to text/talk to my friend and tell her she can subtly let people know what happened (especially Karen). 

This baby bump is sales gold, I just landed a BIG commission *while sitting!* 

I still think, as great as Jim is, I need to get out of this town. I'll always be a trailer park slut to people around here. My mama died when I was real young and I acted out a lot after that. Everyone knows what I did and won't let me forget. Despite working my ass off to graduate, working my way up to sales lead, buying my home and fixing it up myself. I'm sick of Oklahoma. I'm thinking maybe somewhere in Oregon or Washington. Real pretty up there. 

Again, thank you for all the kind and helpful advice. I feel so much better. This has always been one of my favorite subs to lurk. Thanks. ",1473872069.0,"I'm [27F] having troubles answering people's questions about my pregnancy, caused some drama with friends (all 20s)",0.97
629,veryangryhusband,Non-Romantic,410uzl,1982,"Edit:  Married a year and a half

My parents (50s) couldn't handle the thought of empty nesting.  They adopted my sister and brought her home when she was four.  She's Korean.  I have two older brothers(27,29) but we only have the one sister.  We all kind of dote on her and kind of spoil her a bit but she's not a brat or anything.  

So here's the back story.  My grandma sadly passed away last June.  So she left her house and some money to my parents.  It's not a lot of money but the house is worth a ton.  My parents decided to make some changes on their trust and will leave my sister their house and, my grandparents' house which they just inherited.  They apportioned some money to all three of us boys but amounts to a small fraction of what my sister got.  The three of us were happy she's taken care of and talked about giving up our share for her.  But we don't want to sound ungrateful to our parents for leaving us something.

None of us have a problem with this.  The oldest of my brothers has two kids and one on the way and he got more than middle brother and I got because my parents name his kids as beneficiaries for some money as well.  None of us have a problem with that either.  We all just kind of hope my parents live a long time still, and we won't have to worry about that stuff any time soon.  By the way, the amounts are not much we're talking less than $100K.  The two houses combined are well into seven figures.  That's the only significantly large amount in all this.

As far as I know my two SIL's don't care either.  But my wife had a friend over and she was venting to her about her frustration with the way the money was allocated in the will.  I came home early from work yesterday and walked in through the back yard and in the back door.  I always walk in that way cause of how I park.  I wasn't trying to sneak in.  

My wife said she had a problem with my older brother getting more because he has kids and said ""we need to hurry up and have kids if that's the case.""  I stood in the kitchen listening for a while.  They were in the living room.  Then she started about my sister and initially called her a spoiled little bitch.  Then it escalated from there.  I was frozen at first and didn't walk right in until the racist comments came out.  Her best friend's reaction was of shock.  She tried to calm her and tell her it's not as big a deal as she thinks.  She told her she was going over board but my wife just kept at it, getting angrier and more disgusting with her language.

I walked in and asked her if she's felt that way about my sister all along, and about other races (we're all white American).  She stopped in her tracks and asked me how long i'd been listening.  I said ""all along but not long enough apparently.""  She started raising her voice about my family spoiling her and doing her a disservice.  Honestly, I didn't hear most of what she said at this point.  I was way beyond furious and sick.  I looked at her friend and she immediately stood up and excused herself and left.

I can't look at my wife.  I can't say how I feel about her right now.  She didn't take any of it back or apologize.  She said she chose the wrong words but that she's right about the point she's making.  She's always been nice to my sister.  But I didn't feel as though this was just a moment of rage on her part over the money.  We're not even going to see any of that money for decades (hopefully). 

Whenever called her out on the racist remarks she just deflected and said I was missing the point.  She says it's no big deal and people just say those thing when they're angry.  

I don't know about all that ""people saying racist things when they're angry.""  I know that it makes me extra sick that it was about my sister.  Not to diminish racist remarks about anybody, but I'll admit that I lost it in large part because it was about my sister.  So she went to stay at her parents and told me to call her when I'm ready to talk.  I don't know if I'll ever be ready.  I feel sick, like literally sick to my stomach.  I was a bit blindsided by this.

I got an apologetic text from my wife's best friend.  She feels horrible that she didn't do more to stop her.  I told her I had no  problem with anything she said or how she reacted.  She did try to stop her by the way but there was no stopping her.  I remember her saying ""Oh my god"" several times, and ""don't even say that as a joke,"" more than once.  Even though it was clear she wasn't joking.  She tried to reel her in but there was no stopping her.  

My sister would be devastated because she truly loves my wife.  I feel sick and hope she never finds out.  If anybody in my family finds out, I don't know how my wife's relationship with any of them survives this when she's not accepting it at all.  She thinks it's no big deal cause it was just a moment of anger.

**EDIT** Just want to address my parents leaving her most of the assets since so many find it odd.  There was a ton of planning done with a law firm.  It's not like they're handing my sister two sets of house keys with just a ""good luck kid.""  They assigned a trustee (my brother) and back up trustees (my other brother, and me).  Everything from who gets custody of her to how and when she gets the money is spelled out.  As far as grandma's house, it's my understanding she explicitly told my parents (in writing) she wanted my sister to have her house (she had her reasons and we all respect that, and nobody was surprised by it considering how close they were).  So that's her's alone and all rental income is for her trust fund.  My brothers are well on their way financially.  I will be fine.  For now, my sister is the one that needs the most protection and security.  Maybe later that will change in terms of my parents' house or any other money.  For now it's how it is and everybody is happy with that arrangement.  We are talking about arrangements in case of a tragedy.  Hopefully this is something that won't happen for a couple or more decades.  I don't think it's a big deal at all.

My husband travels often for work. I also work, but only part time, and I am very appreciative of the sacrifices my husband makes to provide for our family. We are more than comfortable financially.

My husband usually does 3 week of travel, then one week home. He often has no service or is too busy while traveling so we don't talk very often. I get lonely and stir crazy during those three weeks when I'm alone with our son. Sometimes friends come over, but most of the time I'm running around trying to get all the chores done/take care of our son and I don't have time to just hang out. 

A few months ago, a friend suggested that I get a sitter and go out to dinner. Now, I do it probably once or twice per 3 week period. I wasn't hiding it from my husband, it just never came up because we only talk in short spurts. I never thought it would be an issue because we usually get a sitter for a night when he comes home. 

I mentioned it to him today (he just got home for the start of the week) and he is livid. He told me I'm not doing my job and I'm wasting money selfishly. He said I get breaks at work and after our son goes to bed (though I usually use that time to catch up on chores) and it's wrong to leave our son when my husband has to work 24/7 on these business trips.

631,Humpiback,Non-Romantic,7kgxhx,1973,"I'm not a fan of my sister in law Jenny. In the last three years that I've known her she's done everything she could to drive me crazy. She enjoys it. She's always unnecessarily mean, makes fun of me and my friends and always criticizes everything about me.

My other sister in law Marry [31F] and I are close though, she's great. I sometimes look after her dog for her.

Last week Jenny just assumed that I'm going to look after her dog for a few days without even asking. I've never done this for her. She came to drop it off and told me (she did not ask) to take care of the dog for a few days. I told her that I won't do that. She asked for an explanation and I said I don't owe her an explanation and I don't care about her stupid dog. She got angry, called me a B-word and left.

Apparently she left the dog with a friend and the dog had an accident while at that friend's place and eventually died. I don't know the details as I never asked.

Jenny now blames me for this. She says that if I had agreed to take care of the dog none of this would have happened. She posted that on social media along with some rants calling me names. She received backlash from some friends who thought she was unfairly attacking me. She deleted everything later.

Now my mom tells me that she's spoken with Jenny and Jenny would like an apology from me for the pain that I've caused her. My mom and dad told me that I should apologize for turning down Jenny's request of taking care of her dog (it wasn't a request, it was an order), about calling her dog stupid and for causing the chain of events that led to her dog's death.

I don't think I did anything wrong. She is very rude and mean to me, why would I do her a favor when she's not even asking nice?

I told my parents that once Jenny apologizes for calling me the B-word and for her general meanness and rudeness and for the things she called me on social media, I will tell her how sorry I am that her dog is dead. But I won't apologize for not agreeing to taking care of the dog and I won't accept any responsibility for what happened.

My parents say they're disappointed in me.

Am I doing anything wrong here? Are they all right and I'm wrong and at fault here? Should I apologize?

632,gottadropoffquick,Personal issues,522wbc,1972,"My family has a very sad history. My parents met in high school, grew up close and were very successful in their careers. They had their first child when they were 22, their second at 25, and me at 29. When I was 5, my mother and father divorced. 

My father was broken from this, and our happy family went down the drain. I've never been close to my older brother and sister, and my father pushed me away. When I was about 7, my father met another woman, who I became close friends with. She was very kind to me, and had a healing effect on my father. She gave birth to a child, but subsequently died in childbirth. I was left to effectively raise my new sister, as my father didn't really do anything to care for her. 

It worked out OK, I guess. My birth mother and father got back together. My other two siblings were never nice to her, and my father didn't really care for any of us.  I at the end did my best to look out for her, and we're really close as a result. 

I moved out with my high school girlfriend into an apartment together near University, but I always kept up with my lil sis. However, last time I took her out to a movie with my girlfriend, I noticed she was pretty down. With enough prodding, I realized that my birth mother had been bullying her. Months of constant verbal and emotional abuse had been going on. 

I confronted my mother about it, and she brought my brother and sister into it as well. Cue a huge shouting match, them calling me akin to a blood traitor and me calling them the miserable sods that they are. I've practically been pushed away and told never to come back. 

Meanwhile, my little sister is still over there, suffering. My dad's no help, and it's affecting her health and grades. What can a guy do?

633,EMilinko,Updates,4ra67w,1966,"Hello All,

So, I posted here last week about a girl I met and had a one night stand with.  Shortly after this happened I started thinking about her a lot and wanting to see her again.  I didn't have any of her contact info.  I didn't even know her last name.  All I knew was where she lived.  So I went to the bar where I met her and asked the people who work there if they know her and if she comes in there a lot.  

They knew her.  She does go in there a lot according to them.  But they also both told me she's ""the R word.""  And this wasn't just them joking around.  I mean, they meant it.  The guy who served us that night even questioned why I couldn't tell, and told me if he would have known I was going home with her he would have stopped me.  Afterwords I felt really disgusted with myself and was even worried about getting in trouble with the law.  Because a mentally challenged person can't consent.  

Here is the original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbrem/me_33_m_had_a_one_night_stand_with_a_girl_people/

So, I decided to hell with them.  I followed the advice I got on this sub and another forum I posted on.  (And I just want to say, people on this sub were amazing.  You guys really helped me see the situation for what it was.)  

So anyway...  to the actual update.  I went to her house and left a note with my number and told her I want to see her again and to call if she is interested.  And if not, no hard feelings.  

Well, she didn't call, but she did text me on Thursday afternoon.  She told me she hopes it's ok that she texted instead of calling, and that she hates talking on the phone.  (I am mentioning this because someone told me it might be an indicator of Autism.)  And sorry to trail off a little here... but the night we met and had a one nighter she wouldn't let me kiss her on the mouth.  And from what I read some people with Autism are standoffish like that when it comes to physical affection and stuff.  

So, I will stop going off on tangents.  We decided to go out on a date Saturday night.  We met at the same bar where they told me she was ""the R word"".  Meeting there was her suggestion.  But I ended up taking her to this Japanese place here in town, because she loves Sushi.  We went back to her place and I stayed there with her until about an hour ago.  

I am not sure how many details to give... but we had a good weekend together.  On Saturday night when we got back to her place we watched a few movies and had a few drinks.  And yes, if anyone wonders, there was carnal knowledge. (Quite a few times over the weekend, lol.) 

And then yesterday a few of her friends dropped by.  Nobody had to work today because it's the 4th of July, so there was pretty much an impromptu party at her place last night.  They didn't know she had company but it was fine.  I got to meet a lot of her friends.  They seem like good people.  Apparently her house is the hangout house in her circle of friends.  

Today we went out and did a few things.  I would have stayed with her longer, but I have to be at work really early tomorrow and have to get to bed early tonight.  We are already talking about going out again this weekend.  I can't really see her during the week because of conflicting work schedules.  (She works at night, I work during the day.)  But we both have weekends off.)

As far as her mental condition... screw it.  I don't see anything wrong with her.  She may be Autistic, but obviously it doesn't affect her life all that much.  

So, to everyone who wanted an update, there it is.  I want to thank everyone again fro all the encouragement and for all the positivity.  It's been a long time since I've felt like this.  
This could really be a good thing.  Her and I are really clicking.  

**tl;dr**: Had a one night stand with a girl people think is mentally challenged.  She isn't, and I spent the whole weekend with her.  

EDIT:  I did not post this thread to argue about Autism.  I also don't claim to be an expert on it.  The ideas I expressed in this post were not meant to offend anyone, sorry if I did.  And I am not narrow minded enough to think that just because someone doesn't like to kiss on the mouth or talk on the phone that they are Autistic.  I was just saying those are things that COULD BE linked to Autism.  ",1467679764.0,"[Update] Russian guy (33/M) who slept with ""mentally challenged"" American girl [31/f]",0.95

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25m8vh/me_27f_with_my_husband_31m_marriage_counselor/ 


A lot happened since then and it occurred to me that maybe I should post an update in case anyone here was around for that. 


Summary: I was the wife who was seeing a marriage counselor with my husband. Both jointly and individually. Things were only getting worse and worse and it was only after a blow up fight that my husband and I compared notes and realized the counselor had been feeding each of us lies. 


Counselor was telling me that my husband was emotionally 12 years old and would never be capable of a relationship (while reassuring my husband all was well with him). Meanwhile, he was telling my husband I had borderline personality disorder and needed medication. 


When my husband started accusing me of being mentally ill, I brought this up to the counselor who then began making fun of my husband for saying such a thing (""Does he think he's a psychiatrist or something?"" He actually laughed.) Counselor reassured me that I was a ""beautiful and intelligent woman"" and would do great once I left my husband. 


The counselor (who was provided by the military through their family services) ended up being transferred a few weeks after we discovered this. We couldn't figure out if he got canned for abusing some other couple, if he retired, or some other shenanigan. 



Well. Fast forward to today. My husband and I are doing great now. We went on a vacation, both of us changed jobs, moved, and we are very happily married now four years later. We travel, adopted a couple of kitties, and bought a house in a place we both love. 


How we got here: We both read some self-help books. Started giving each other the benefit of the doubt. Got better at communicating. I left my super high stress job, he changed careers, and everything sort of did a 180. (Funny enough. My old job had been killing me and when I'd mentioned to counselor that I thought maybe I should find another job, since it was so dysfunctional, he protested against it.)


My husband and I did not report him at the time. We were concerned he would retaliate against my husband in some way, as my husband was in the armed forces for a year and a half after all this.  I am embarrassed that we did not report him. We were scared and overwhelmed. I am considering calling that base's family services now and filing an official report. Not sure if it'll matter, so much time has passed. 


That's... That's all really. You all were such a great help then, I thought I might as well post this in case anyone around here remembered. 


 PS. I thought to post this after we watched an M Night Shyamalan movie recently. One of the commenters had mentioned this sounded like a film he'd make. :) I still laugh at that comment years later, so thank you U/brandon23z and u/acheronshunt for that.

635,,Non-Romantic,3wxyig,1962,"So much drama, sorry if I sound like a whiny person.

I am not sure other people will get this, but being pitted against someone who looks just like you is insulting and degrading. Everything about my twin sister (Kaylee) and I was compared. If one of us was taller or gained more weight, the other heard about it. 

Our grades were compared, our clothing was identical, and our parents love depended on who was the best. So they never truly loved us. We were props in their war against one another, in making them new friends, and to feel good about themselves. 

In HS I got the chance to move to live with my aunt [56f]. My sister [26f] was the winner of the twin battle (I stopped trying a long time ago) and I guess they didn't need the second twin anymore. I had gained weight and wasn't as cute or ""smart"" anymore. 

I begged my aunt to take me, because I wanted to kill myself. 

When I loved with her, I started going by a totally new name. Kaylee and I had matching names. Kayla and Kaylee. 

I started going by Charlotte (after my favorite book *Charlotte's Bad Ass Web*) and the school allowed me to go by that instead. For roll, I just told the teacher my preferred name and they wrote it in. 

I didn't tell people I was a twin. I dyed my hair, lost some weight, started getting great grades, and was a whole new person. 

I owe my aunt more than I could ever repay her. I stopped going home for the holidays (no one missed me) and when I turned 18 I legally changed my name. I changed it to Charlotte NewLastName. 

I went to college. I got a boyfriend. I got married. I had kids. I didn't talk to my parents, I didn't talk to my sister.

Well, I am 26 now and while my husband knows about my twin sister, he doesn't ask about her. However, now my sister, my mom [57f], and my dad [65m] want me back in their life. We have not spoken more than twice in the last 8 years. 

All because they found out my husband makes a lot of money and I have two kids. Not twins, thank God. Though I would love any twins I had. I just don't think I could deal with that reminder of my childhood just yet. 

Kaylee wrote me a long e-mail, saying she understands that our parents were not the kindest people but they have changed. They have apologized to her-- not to me--about the childhood issues and want to do the same for me. 

The big issue is, Kaylee cannot have kids. So the only hope for grandkids is from me. The kids look so much like me, so they also look like Kaylee. 

It creeps me out. I feel like they will go back to ignoring me until they want access to Kaylee's ""honorary kids."" 

My husband has been wavering on this. He says that kids like having multiple family members. But he is leaving the choice up to me. He said that he understands I want nothing to do with them. We are moving soon, so they won't be able to find us then hopefully. But I am afraid they will come back into my life.

What do I do? What do I say?

636,realmeanmommy,Non-Romantic,4rijqw,1966,"My son Simon has a lot of food allergies that we discovered when he was very young. The main ones are gluten, eggs, cocoa or chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. None of the allergies are deadly, but eating these foods makes him very sick. For example, gluten makes him dizzy, he vomits, and he gets headaches, and touching an orange with his bare hands makes his skin itch and swell. Despite these allergies, my son is very friendly, outgoing, and happy, and he is not a picky eater, he will eat pretty much anything he isn't allergic to.

I know not everybody is used to dealing with these types of allergies, so I try to be very accommodating. I pack his school lunches and send a box of gluten free brownies to the school every month or so in case a kid has a birthday and brings in a treat my son can't eat. I usually ask his friends' parents if they can sleep over at our house so they don't have to deal with his allergies, but if he does stay over another house I pack him his own food and give the parents a list of things he can't have. I offer to give the parents of his friends bunches of bananas and bags of cut carrots for when he comes over, but most of them say it is no problem and they just keep a few in the house in case he comes over. My son is very good at spotting whole foods he can and can't eat (like he knows he can have blueberries, but he can't eat lemonaid), but I still like to give a list in case the family bakes or cooks something with one of his off limits foods in it. Every family so far has been really kind and accomodating.

My son makes new friends all the time and he recently became friends with a new boy at his school. They have become very close very quickly. They wanted to have a sleep over a few weeks ago and I contacted the other mother and asked if Simon and his friend could stay at our house. I explained that it makes things easier because of the food allergies. The other mother said she would not be okay with that because there is no man in my house (I'm divorced) and she wants her son safe. I live in a very safe gated community, but I know some people are very protective of their kids. So I sent Simon over with a safe cookie for a snack and some cereal and almond milk for the morning. The next morning, the mother dropped them off and told me that she was unhappy about Simon eating his own food. She said she thought he should bring enough for everyone. I told her out right that most kids who are used to eating regular cookies don't like gluten free cookies because they taste different, and they're also very expensive so I couldn't buy a whole box every weekend. But I said okay.

The next weekend, Simon stayed over there again with a few other boys for a little Fourth of July party. I sent a whole box of cookies, more cereal with almond milk, and a big bag of safe oatmeal with instructions. The oatmeal is just certified gluten free oats with some brown sugar and nutritional powder, and you add the almond milk and stir slowly for maybe 5 minutes until it gets soft. I figured this way the mom could make them the same oatmeal if she wanted to be fair or she could use the cereal if she didn't want to cook. I picked Simon up the next day and he looked kind of sad. The mother kind of snidely told me she didn't appreciate having to cook for my son, I asked her what she meant, she talked about the oatmeal. Then her son came up and told me that he didn't like the cookies much, but he really loved the oatmeal, and he said thank you. (I don't know where this good is learning his good manners because it isn't his mother.)

In the car, Simon told me he was sad because the night before, the other mother had taken all of the boys on a surprise trip to McDonalds. He politely asked if he could stop at my house to get a sandwich that was safe for him to eat because we only live five minutes away. I guess his friend's mom snapped at him and said he needed to ""man up"" and find something on the menu he could eat. Simon was so embarassed that he sat there and ate nothing while his friends ate burgers and fries. I am not okay with shaming my son or with language like ""man up,"" so I called the other mother and asked her about the situation. She basically told me that she thought I was making up Simon's allergies to make him seem ""special,"" and anyway, ""It's not like he'll die from them."" I was kind of shocked, so I said that I think Simon needs to stay home this weekend. Now I'm not sure what to do.

As a background note, my husband and I divorced on good terms a few years back because we realized we wanted different things from life. My husband remarried and moved to a big city on the other side of the United States that is very diverse and has lots of restaurants and stores that cater to all kinds of people. My son visits his dad in the summer and never has a problem getting food there, also, he mostly plays with his stepsister when he's there, so he doesn't worry about going to other people's houses.

How do I stand my ground with this mother without pushing too far? Am I expecting too much? Can my son still be friends with this boy?

   
**tl;dr**: My son Simon has a lot of food allergies. I normally send him to sleepovers and school with safe food but his new friend's mother doesn't seem to think that's enough and is making it difficult for him when he stays over. How do I make sure Simon can have his new friend and be safe?

Well, after roughly 90% of you (and my friends) insisted, I sent a message to the fiancee:

 *You don't know me and until Friday, I didn't know you existed either. I'm so sorry to tell you this, but since October last year I've been on and off hooking up and sexting with ______.*

*We met on Tinder. He mentioned an ex and I knew we weren't exclusive, but he certainly never said he was in a relationship the whole fucking time.* 

*I don't know. Maybe you're in an open relationship and know all about it. Maybe he's already told you because I texted him on Friday telling him I know. I'm done. I don't intend to contact you again and I literally never want to see _____ again ever, but I wanted to tell you, because if my fianc?e was fucking other people, I for one would want to know.*

*I don't want to go into lurid detail as quite frankly I'd just like to forget the whole thing right now, but I can send you more proof in the form of photos and whatsapp transcripts if you want.* 

*Good luck with whatever you do x*

She's read it. She's not replied. He's not said anything to me either, although he has deleted the photo tweet where he announced their engagement that she had retweeted. There is still another tweet where he references their marriage, so I don't know whether she told him to remove the photo or he took it down and forgot about the other tweet. 
I was shit scared coming home from work today in case he was waiting for me outside my house or something, but he wasn't.

638,dustydingbat,Updates,btdndz,1959,"After making the original post, a series of things happened that caused me to be upset; I think all the comments brought to light how abusive he was, so I started standing up for myself and opened up about the many things that were wrong. [Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bqbdkl/bf_21m_told_me_22f_yesterday_that_i_should_go_out/)   


Backstory: shortly after making the post, since he kept expressing things for the last few months that made me feel like he wants to be single (e.g. he goes on about wanting to solo-travel, he wants to go out and meet new people and complains that I don't offer him that social lifestyle; and then he brought up wanting to move overseas) I got the courage to tell him it makes me concerned that he has spoken about moving overseas (or travelling) but never included me in the vision, he raised his voice and said ""well, if I move overseas then who cares we'll just break up"". Obviously, it sounds like he wants to be single. I know in my heart that if you love someone you see them in these futuristic ideas so I backfired and told him that. He immediately took it back and said ""okay, you took it the wrong way, I meant that it's the worst that could happen"".   


Anyway, after that argument I got distant and felt hurt that someone who I've been seeing for about 3 years is not interested enough in me to be able to visualise me doing amazing things with them. **So, he came home after work (it was a Friday night) and I said ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single""**; he knew I was upset and feeling resentful. So, he went out at about 6pm and didn't come home that night. He called me midday and wanted to get lunch with me, so I texted him everything expressing why I was still upset; for those of you that want the goss this is the exact text (can skip if cba doesn't add much to the story):  


*""It's funny that you say something so strongly like ""if I move then we're breaking up who cares"" and then expect me to be able to forget it. Your plans and comments all sound like you want to be single, you want to go solo travelling, you want to meet new people and openly complain about how i don't offer you that, you want to move overseas but never thought of me in that vision. Those are straight red flags in any relationship, it doesn't come down to me being concerned bc of ""not having a life"" and me ""not being confident"" like you would hope to put it to. You've fucked up my head by making me believe if i was just more this n that then maybe I'd be able to come. You could of just left it at a strong fuck yea i want you to come, or no I really need to do this by myself, but you never did, and instead you had to try convince me why i wasn't good enough when deep down you knew you wanted to go alone. I told you weeks ago to stop making me feel like i'm inadequate and that was well before this bullshit travelling topic came up.""*  


Anywho, he replied that he feels like his life is really boring and that many of his friends are moving overseas so he feels ""sh\*t scared out of being bored"". **He said he has been projecting that frustration towards me (which so many of the comments on the original post pointed out!! Well done).** He said he'd hate for me to change, and that he does really love me and that he is sorry.   


So, I ended up meeting up with him that day to see what else he had to say.. we hung out most of the day, **and then he told me that he slept with someone else**, he was crying and said that he took my ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single"" seriously and genuinely thought I was breaking up with him. He said to me ""the person I loved was out the door, and so I drunk heavily and ended up going back to a girl's house and ended up having sex with her when I was blackout drunk"". He also said he was sick of how things were going in our relationship, and all he wants is for both of us to be happy.  


So, despite him finally admitting that he has been in the wrong with the way he has been treating me, he has now cheated on me and brought about a whole new level of issues to the relationship. Now I'm incredibly confused, I don't know what I want. All of the initial issues sound resolved, but now I have to deal with the fact he has toyed with my trust, is his behaviour here acceptable given that I loosely said go be single?  


TL;DR: After an ongiong argument to do with him not seeing me as good enough and sounding like he wants a life without me, I told him out of resentfulness ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single"" and he did just that and had ""blackout drunk sex"" with another girl.

640,helpinghand00,Non-Romantic,4eyp96,1954,"So here's the situation:

My wife grew up with a really sensitive family. That's the *best* way I can put it. Her family was manipulative, controlling, and downright mean. Narcissists? Easily all of them, really. Except one of her sisters who is so traumatized by their family's social dynamic that she chokes up and cries if my wife talks about it. My wife happily overcame it and got out at 18. She shelter hopped while getting her education and made it all on her own. We met when she was at the highest point of her new freedom and I'd never known anyone happier. Knowing this, when we married she seriously nitpicked who was at the wedding. She has contact with maybe 5 people at the most from her side of the family and everyone else are quite distant.

She has a few on her facebook. They never talk to her, so she forgets they exist. So this is about one of them who isn't really even a part of her family. When my wife was a pre-teen her aunt on her mom's side had a high school friend named Jane. Jane had like five kids. All different dads. Not on good terms with any of the dads and jumped from boyfriend to boyfriend. They invited Jane on a vacation to California once with her kids. Not all of them, just the youngest two. Her daughter (Karen) and her three year old son (Donald). My wife described Karen as 'the worst'.

Apparently, even though Karen is around my wife's age (like two years younger maybe), she had this insane control issue and totally lacked a filter. She was constantly neck and neck with my wife as kids trying to assert herself as the dominant kid on the vacation. She would write lists for my wife and her siblings to obey, she would get mad and fly into rages if they didn't follow them, and even hit my wife's youngest sister (who has a heart condition) and called her slow and fat. Apparently that was the breaking point and my wife told me she 'calmly got up, dragged Karen by her hair to the door, and literally slapped her until she was out the door of the hotel room and locked her out'. After explaining why Karen wasn't in the room to her aunt, my wife's aunt just sighed and hugged my wife and told her Karen could sleep in her room so that she wouldn't bother any of the children.

Before the trip ended Karen was forced to apologize to my wife and used this as the reason, ""Sorry I hit your sister and yelled at you. My dad used to r*pe me all the time and I don't have a dad but you do so I hate you.""

Jane turned totally red and never joined them on a vacation again. Later my wife asked her mom if that was true and her mom answered, ""Karen doesn't know who her dad is. So no, that isn't true. Jane doesn't let her boyfriends stay over.""

She saw Karen later in life when they were teenagers. Karen calmed down significantly but kept bugging my wife to get her alone to try and help her search for her real dad on myspace. My wife politely refused and Karen flew into a rage and bit her. My wife slapped her across the face and told her to check herself and stop initiating fights. She called her out for lying about her dad and told her that lying about r*pe can ruin lives and to never do it again. Karen cried and ran to her mom who did nothing because she thought it would be ridiculous to harp on a teenager for dumb shit like that. After that Karen never spoke to my wife again.

So after my wife struggled through adulthood to get to where she is, she actually went to therapy and got great advice on setting boundaries with family. Now her mother and her get along fine and her mother shed her abusive behavior and is supportive and kind. My wife's aunt somewhat deteriorated and went through a depression spell (46 year old woman who went out and got inseminated for God knows why and has a newborn now) so my wife distanced herself from her. She gets along with her stepdad who was always pretty nice and she gets along with her siblings who grew out of their abusive tendencies as well.

Now, beginning of March my wife saw something pop up on her facebook feed. An article posted by Karen. My wife didn't register who posted it because she doesn't usually look at the poster anyways. She just likes or ignores. Someone on the article was just being straight up horrendous and my wife corrected them on their behavior. She wasn't rude about it, and the person wasn't discussing the article anyways. They were using it to push their own agenda and ended up posting someone's personal information to try and get people to go shame that person for having an opposing view. Wife reported it and called the guy out.

Karen, even though she was arguing against the guy, told my wife to quit being rude to people on her profile. Wife just laughed and deleted Karen and moved on. She told me it was stupid to get involved and she forgot she had that girl added and didn't care if Karen was on her friend's list.

So fast forward to this month. This week is my wife's family reunion. She was invited every year for three years and never wanted to go. This year she decided she was in a place with her family where she could comfortably go. She figured she'd use this reunion as an opportunity to announce our pregnancy.

So we're at the reunion freaking yesterday and guess who's there. Karen. My wife was a little surprised because she even told me that it didn't feel like her family really liked them anyways. The final straw was that last time when Karen bit my wife. Apparently in that same visit their family gave my wife's aunt's family scabies and they were deemed dirty and nobody wanted to visit with them again.

Well I figured it would be awkward for my wife to talk to Karen and my wife agreed so we ignored her. She approached my wife, smelling like beer, and told her, ""I'm sorry for getting upset on Facebook the other day (month ago). You weren't being nice to my friends and I just can't have that. Being blunt isn't appreciative when it starts to hurt feelings. Hope you understand.""

My wife just smiled and said, ""I'm gonna need you to leave me alone. I haven't seen my family in years and would appreciate it if you'd find somebody else to talk to while I enjoy this day.""

Karen rolled her eyes and said, ""Whatever bitch.""

My wife just chuckled and turned to the group and was like, ""Well ooo-kay anyways!"" and suddenly out of freaking nowhere I see Karen move really quick out of the corner of my eye. Thankfully, my wife's stepdad was right next to her and grabbed her hand and I hear, ""Did you just try to break a beer bottle over my daughter's head."" 

That's when Karen starts blubbering and crying and saying that my wife was always mean and thought she was better than everyone else and her dad r*ped her when she was a kid so she only knows violence etc. My wife just rolls her eyes and says, ""Again with the lies. What a c*nt."" and walks away and I followed. Karen was asked to leave with Jane and Donald and we thought that was the end of it.

Right before my wife planned to announce her pregnancy my wife's aunt walks up to her and tells her she needs to leave too. She told her that using the word 'c*nt' at a family reunion was enough to get kicked out over and that she was always really standoffish to Karen and never gave her a chance. My wife's mom joined up and said it can be fixed if she just agrees to apologize to Karen and moves on from instigating fights with her.

My wife just downed the rest of her grape juice, walked out into the middle of everyone and yelled out, ""I'm pregnant. Cool huh? And nobody here will ever get to meet the baby. Peace c*nts.""

And we left.

We drove back to our hotel and decided instead of talking to family or answering calls we'd go to the beach and enjoy a new vacation and then go home.

Here's the issue though. It's 3 in the afternoon and we haven't left because my wife can't stop crying. She feels so alienated from her family and alone. She feels like maybe she did take it over the top, and that her family will never side with her because she's so blunt about everything and she doesn't want to break off forever and go no contact but now she feels like it's her only option after her outburst.

I feel bad. I'm not in a place to give her advice because I truly don't know what I'd do. So that's why I'm here. How would any of you console my wife at this point and how can we either remedy this or comfortably stick to a no contact plan and ride off into the sunset drama free with a cute baby on the way?

**TLDR: Wife's childhood ""friend"" had an abusive outburst at our family reunion over a Facebook post. Tried to break a bottle over my wife's head.

I know it's been a short amount of time since I last posted but so much has happened already!! 

First of all, the advice I got gave me the courage to tell my mom what had been happening. She was a bit hurt that I did not think she was enough (not true at all but I understand why it would come off that way), but was even more upset that I had been feeling so badly about myself. I told her the morning after I posted, before school, and she let me take the day off and took me out to lunch so we could talk about everything and rehash my feelings. She was glad I'd come into contact with my half-brother and said he sounded like a nice boy. She was also said we couldn't talk anymore, but understood completely why and does not blame him at all. The next day after we talked she told me that she thinks I could use talk therapy; apparently, she had seen one briefly when I was a baby and it helped her a lot. We couldn't get an appointment for soon, but in three weeks I will see a therapist for the first time. 

Now for this next part I will use names for the most part since there are a lot of people, so it could get confusing otherwise. One comment made in the last post stuck out to me, that I could make a fake account of some sort and talk to my brother, Ryan, that way. I was kind of nervous about getting Ryan in trouble, but I did want to say a proper goodbye: during our last conversation I was in shock and upset so I didn't get the chance to tell him how much I appreciate him talking to me. So I decided to find a way to at least do that and almost immediately found a really obvious way: Instagram. I made a fake one and messaged his account, telling him I don't want to get him in trouble but that it means the world to me that he went out of his way to find me and that I love him. I told him he didn't even have to reply. But Ryan did respond to me. He told me he loved me too and that he wants to talk again when he's in college. He told me something else though: that he'd told our older sister, Hayley, about me a couple of weeks after he found me and that he thinks she'd respond if I reached out to her. (I have another older sister, Sarah, but she's a huge ""Daddy's girl"" so Ryan was afraid to tell her.) Ryan said that she was nervous and shy about contacting me so I should make the first move. He gave me Hayley's school e-mail and I sent her something telling her who I was.

This morning, I found a very long, kind, and loving email from Hayley in my inbox! She is 20 and goes to college 10 hours away. She told me how happy she was to hear from me. Hayley also shed light on my bio dad and his wife: the biggest reason why she was so receptive to me was that she was already used to the idea of him cheating. When she was very young, her and Sarah had a best friend for years. Then one day, when Hayley was around 10, my sisters abruptly weren't allowed to hang out with her anymore or talk to her at school. When she was eighteen, Hayley's mother told her that the reason why was that my bio dad and the friend's mom had been having an affair and had been caught. Ryan doesn't know this. Hayley also told me that she remembers a lot of times when she was in high school when our dad and her mom almost divorced, and that they actually separated for two years when she was a kid. From the tone of her email Hayley does not seem to like our dad very much and I understand why. She also told me she doesn't think it's a good idea to tell Sarah about me right now, since she will just run to their mom with the info and make things horrible at home, which will affect Ryan the most. She did however give me the home address of my aunt Jolene, my bio dad's younger sister. Apparently Jolene is estranged from my bio dad and his wife, but still talks to my half-siblings, so is an ideal person to contact. 

Thank you so much, Reddit, for helping to give me the courage to reach out and make all these family connections! I feel a bit selfish doing it, like I could be forcing my way into their lives. But they do seem happy to talk to me. 

I have one piece of sad news, however: Hayley also told me that, within the two months Ryan and I were out of touch, that my paternal grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She had been having memory problems for a year before the diagnosis but the family is still very sad. However, I don't know if I should try to talk to my grandparents now. They have a lot on their plate, as does the rest of my extended family. I don't want to be a bother. 

Again: thank you reddit!!!

642,grievingsister,Non-Romantic,4t2sc7,1955,"Hello r/relationships. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this because it is about my relationship with my sister but my sister is dead so I guess it's a personal issue. I'm just looking for some help and advice. I'm posting with a throwaway because people know my main and I don't want my baggage out there for all of them to see.

I?ll start with some background about my sister: She started tanning when she was 14. School had just finished and she got a babysitting job for the summer. She used some of the money she made to go to the tanning beds. She would go at least twice week. She was constantly out in the sun too and never wore sunscreen. She met her husband when she was 20 and they got married a couple of years later. A year after the wedding she gave birth to a baby boy, my nephew. When he was a few weeks old she took him to the doctor for a checkup and the doctor noticed a mole on her arm that he told her to get checked because it looked suspicious. She didn't want to go but he made her promise to. She went to see a dermatologist and he was concerned enough to do a biopsy. It came back malignant and my sister was diagnosed with melanoma. The doctors did what they could to treat her but it had already spread. She died on the one year anniversary of her diagnosis. It was one month after her son's first birthday, two months after her second wedding anniversary and three months after her 24th birthday (to the day).

I am so angry with her. I know she?s dead so it doesn?t make sense but I can?t help it. The risks of tanning beds and the sun are so well known. My sister lived in a developed country, in a middle class home and she graduated high school and community college. No offense to anyone who isn?t, but she had no excuse. I tried to tell her and so did other people but she didn?t listen. She went twice a week and baked in the sun every chance she got. She tanned while pregnant. At first she didn?t tell the tanning salon about her pregnancy and once she started showing she tanned outside instead. Even after she was diagnosed with melanoma we found out she continued to tan. She said she couldn?t stand not being tanned. Don?t get me wrong. I loved my sister. She was a good person, loving, kind and ambitious. Her death hurts like hell and I give anything for more time with her. But I am so angry at her and I feel like I hate her too. She left behind a son who won?t remember her, a husband who she was the love of his life and a devastated family and many friends too. She worked at a charity and was always helping people. She could have done so much good but I can?t stop hating her for wasting it. She didn?t even stop when she was diagnosed. It?s been 10 months since she died and all the anger and hate is still there. I?m the same age she was when she died. I love my sister (if that makes sense) and I don?t want to hate her. Please help if you have any advice.

tl;dr My sister used tanning beds twice a week since she was 14 and she tanned outside too. She was diagnosed with melanoma but still kept tanning. She died and left behind a one year old son and her husband and family. I am so anger at her for being reckless but I don't want to hate her.",1468637965.0,My [24F] sister died from melanoma.

643,wtfjambiscuits,Non-Romantic,44qsw0,1955,"I've been a tomboy my entire life. I was sporty spice when I was younger, I was the father when my friends and I played house. My mother never dressed me up as a little girl so my wardrobe has always been pretty gender neutral. My humor is also not very *ladylike* and pretty much something you'd expect out of a dude. I've had many male friends tell me they see me as ""one of the bros"" because I'm not afraid to point out a nice ass or talk about gross things. Now, I DO have female friends, I'm definitely not one of those ""all my friends are guys"" chicks, my friend circle was pretty equal and I liked it. 

A reason why it was so easy for my male friends to see me as a ""bro"" is that I've been overweight almost my whole life. Once I started my period, I slowly put on weight up until mid 2014. I'm fairly short and was morbidly obese by the time I started losing weight. At my highest weight my BMI was around 42-45. It was bad. I dropped about 100 pounds in a year, which seems drastic, but honestly it was mostly from cutting out soda and fast food. It's amazing what that crap does to your body. By mid 2015 I was 130, with a BMI of about 26. I was still overweight and I wasn't losing weight as fast. It almost seemed like I had plateaud. But in July, I witnessed some fucked up shit that left me with PTSD, on top of worsening the mental illnesses I already had. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I ended up losing a lot more weight due to it. By the end of 2015, I was 100 pounds and had a BMI of 20. However, in reality I was severely underweight because I still had access skin and fat from being well over 200 pounds nearly a year before. 

Right now, I'm happy to say I am healing more and more every day from my trauma event and have managed to maintain a healthy weight (no more fainting or blacking out from going days without eating!) Now my problem is that my guy friends have been ""falling in love"" with me or trying to get me to have sex with them by complimenting the fuck outta me. I'm not use to this attention, considering when I was fat I didn't have many times where guys pursued me. Then when they get to know me and learn about my PTSD, I feel like they view me as a damsel in distress and become more attracted to me and the idea of ""fixing me"" despite me not wanting to be fixed... 

So now I don't have many guy friends because they all become attracted to me. That sounds so conceited to me, but it's true... They like the fact that I'm small(height wise, but now weight wise also), that I'm a ""bro"" and not like most girls(their words, not mine), and that I'm a ""damsel in distress"" so I can basically be a project for them to work on. These are things I've heard from about a dozen guys since I became a normal weight last August. At first it was confusing for me, not being use to the attention, so I ended up leading some of these guys on. I'm naturally friendly with both sexes, so they would take my friendliness as more than it was. When I would reject them with no reason, they would get mad and stop talking to me. When I reject them and explain I'm working through PTSD but would love to stay friends, they would pursue me harder in an attempt to ""fix"" me so friendships don't work. I feel like I lose either way, but since I'm so use to getting along with everyone platonically it is really bumming me out and I don't know how to handle it. I was oblivious to the flirting but I think I've gotten a little better at detecting it, but ultimately I don't know how to maintain friendships with guys anymore. I've lost a lot of great guy friends simply because I didn't want to try a relationship with them. This is such a first world problem but it's seriously bothering me and I'd love advice on how to practically handle adapting to a new life.
   


**tl;dr**: After I lost weight, all my current and new male friends want some sort of intimate relationship with me. I'm also being seen as a ""damsel in distress"" and they want to ""fix"" me. I hate it don't know how to handle these situations.

644,pet17__,Personal issues,2dva7x,1954,"I'm a 17 year old guy, I grew up in a big family.  I have 5 siblings: a sister, 30; brother, 29; brother, 27; sister, 24; and sister 22.  And myself, 17.

I always realized there was a gap between me and the rest of them.  The youngest of them was 5 years older than me, which is not that much older, but it was the biggest gap between two siblings.

I had always figured that I was an accident, or unplanned.  That my parents were done having kids after my last sister, but then I came along and was completely unplanned, hence the big gap.

Being the youngest, even though I felt distant from the rest of them, I felt spoiled all the time.  The way they treated me was how you would expect they would treat the youngest, they nurtured me, and I was often the center of attention.  I did like it.  I wouldn't get as much respect but I would get priority from my siblings over each other in many things.  I was the cute one; I was the precious one; I was the one they always wanted to side with them when they'd have an argument with each other.

My oldest sister, Hannah, always took care of me the best.  I always saw her as a mother figure, never knowing she was actually my mother.  She always spent the most time with me out of all my brothers and sisters, took care of me the best, and was often there for me when my mom wasn't.

My parents were much older than me, and I had always felt more distant from them than from my siblings.  As I said, Hannah, was in many ways a mother-figure towards me in the way that our mother was lacking.

When my father passed away, it was probably the worst part of my life.  I was really young, around 8 years old.  I did not take it well at all.  I cried for weeks, I went crazy, I threw fits at people.  I reacted poorly and negatively towards everyone.  I know my siblings were all going through just as bad a period, but I made it about me.  I didn't even consider them or what they would have been going through emotionally, despite them being there constantly for me.

And recently the same thing happened with mom.  It hit me just as hard, if not harder.  She'd been sick for a long time and slowly getting worse.  Even though I'd lost one parent already and am older, I wasn't at all ready for it when it hit me.

It was after this that Hannah told me the truth.  She sat me down, and braced me that what she was about to tell me would be a shock.  She knew that we were all still recovering from our mother's passing, but a few weeks had passed, and she felt it was enough time to wait before coming out with the truth.  She said she had always wanted to tell me, and only now could she finally.

When she was 13, as many stupid kids do, she had unprotected sex with a boy, and she had gotten pregnant. And that child was me.  At the time her parents had wanted her to give the baby away for adoption, but she was unshakable and wanted to keep her child.  She completely refused to give me, her son, away.

They eventually agreed to keep me, and would raise me in their household, but with her parents as the guardians, and I would grow up thinking they were my real parents.  Apparently, some of my older 'siblings' also knew, but they never mentioned it.  In fact, they are my aunts and uncles.

My mother had made Hannah swear she would never tell me.  When mom got sick, Hannah had approached her and plead with her to relieve her of this burden, because she really wanted to tell me.  My mother had agreed that she could tell me only after some time passed after her death, she wanted to die as my mother, not grandmother.

Hannah said all my life she had wanted to tell me, but had sworn not to.  There were many times where she felt like she had to tell me, but had held herself back.  Now, she was finally glad she was able to tell me the truth she had always wanted to: that I am her son.

I was taken back completely, I had no idea how to react.  In some strange mysterious way, I kind of had always seen her in a more motherly light than my actual mother.  The level of reliance and nurture that was there was much more of a maternal relationship than a fraternal one.

Hannah told me now that I knew, she can finally be my mother openly.  I don't know how to feel about that, I just lost my mother, but now I already have a new one, who is in fact my real one.

Hannah is 30 and I'm 17, and in my mom's will, she had given custody over me for the last year before I turn 18 to Hannah.

Hannah is married and has children in fact, a boy and a girl, 6 and 5.  Her husband is 33, I guess he's now my step-dad?

I had no idea how to respond.  She said she finally had the chance now to raise me as her son, the way it was always meant to be.  I told her I couldn't refer to her as 'mom', it wouldn't feel natural and I just wasn't ready yet, so I'll keep calling her 'Hannah', but I am really glad she told me the truth.  I don't blame her for hiding it this long, it wasn't her fault.  But I'm glad I now know.

I went and spoke with my nephew and niece, in reality my half-brother and half-sister, and me and Hannah explained to them the reality.  They seemed to understand, as best they could.  It kind of shocked them as well, but not nearly as much as it did me.  I sat down with them, I hugged them, I kissed them, I cried.  They asked me why I was crying, I said I don't know.  Telling my half-brother and half-sister how we were really related moved me much more than it did them.  I know now for certain I will always be much closer to them and try to be a more present force in their lives.

I spoke with Hannah's husband, he shook my hand and told me he was proud of me.  He gave me a hug, and told me that he wants to be the main man in my life, and would always be there, and I could come to him whenever I needed anything.  I could tell he was trying to place himself as a father figure towards me, but I don't know if I can accept that.  He's not my father, just happens to be the husband of my biological mother, and does not even have any blood-relation to me.  He's not even that much older, neither is Hannah.  Its weird to see them as parents in any way.

Hannah is really prepared to make this an actual thing, her my mother, me her son.  I was sitting with her family on the couch, when she told me they were ready to be my full family, and she wanted it that way.  She hugged me and didn't let go for so long, I can't imagine what it must have felt like to her.  Finally getting her son back, the son she had been forced to hide from for so long.  She said she was now glad more than ever that she had kept me when I was born, and was absolutely confident it was the right choice.

She asked me why I was being so quiet and had not said much, but she understood why this would be something really heavy to come to grips with.  I didn't like how her husband was there, I never really identified with him, and I didn't see why he needed to be present for this revelation.  I told her I would like to speak with her privately elsewhere, so we went elsewhere in the house.

She told me ""I know this is very heavy for you, if you want to be left alone, I understand.  If you just want to continue our relationship the way it was before, I understand.  But you have to know, you do have a mother still, and she loves you, and she will always be there for you.  Never ever feel like you don't have a home to go to.""  She then hugged me and I couldn't hold back my tears any more, I buried my face against her chest and let out all the tears; she held my head and hushed me, telling me it would all be okay.   She said I'm finally at my real home, and I had nothing to be afraid of.

But I am afraid.  I don't know where I belong.  I have so many fears and apprehensions.  I just lost the only mother I had ever known, I don't know if I can ever accept a second one.  But part of it feels right, like she said, that things are finally corrected.  Personally, I just wish I had known the truth earlier.  But I always felt a stronger connection with her than with any of my other siblings.  She was always my biological mother, nothing can change that.  But does that make her my real mother? Can I accept her as that?  Can I accept this new 'home' as she calls it, can I accept this new family?  I don't even know what real mother means.  Maybe I'm seeing things I'm not meant to see; maybe I'm so devastated and distraught from the death of my mother, I'm willing to give the mantle piece of mother over to Hannah just to lessen the blow of losing a mother, so I tell myself I still have one.  Even if biological mother does not equal real mother, she definitely wants to take on the role of the real mother.  And I do have one year left before I'm an adult, so she's effectively my guardian and parent until then.

I used to alternate between feeling unfulfilled and bored, or very depressed. But now, I feel better.

The advice I've gotten from this subreddit has helped a lot and some of you even PMed me and we talked for a little bit, which mostly helped.

The past couple of weeks, I've started to come out of my shell, so to speak. I started talking to some of the people around me. I'm not very good at talking to people yet. Sometimes I don't know what to say, and even when I do know, it takes me a second or two to think of a response. I talk about simple things, like asking them how their day has been, talking about where they want to go for college, asking about their interests etc.

I still feel depressed every now and then. However, today, I felt happy for the first time. Happy that I'm talking to people, happy that I'm doing well in school, happy about living in general.

I just want to thank all of you.

My close friend Mark [46M] passed away. We?ve been friends for around 25 years.  Even though he was sick, this came as a shock. We knew he had terminal cancer, but he was supposed to have a lot more time. A complication occurred this week and he went pretty fast.


Mark and I [45M] were close because I helped him get sober in our late twenties when he was close to throwing everything away. Mark always introduced me as the friend who saved his life. Over the years, he always stood by my side when things got dark.


One of those times was a year and a half ago when I found out my wife [45F] was cheating. I confronted her in a way that caused almost all of our mutual friends to turn on me and take my wife?s side. I can understand why people were upset, but if I?m totally honest, I don?t regret what I did.


The problem now is that a lot of those people will be at this funeral, because they are friends with Mark and his wife [46F]. Mark had enough time to begin planning what he wanted for his last services. I was supposed to be a pallbearer, but after he died, his wife said she just wasn?t comfortable with that (she also sided with my wife in our divorce).


That hurt, but she said I was still invited to the funeral because of how close Mark and I were. I?m not going to argue with a widow, even if my friend wanted something different. I just want to be able to say goodbye and mourn.


The problem is that my old friends have heard that I?m invited to the funeral and they have begun messaging me that I have no right to go. I?ve received five emails and three text messages from different people telling me that they don?t want to see me at the funeral. Some of these are very hostile. One message said ?If you show up, I will spit in your face.?


I?m afraid my very presence will be too polarizing and will distract from everyone who wants to honor my friend. He deserves a respectful funeral. Is there any way I can attend without causing problems?


TL;DR My very close friend died this week. Most of my friends sided with my wife in our divorce and they are all threatening me if I show up at my friend?s funeral.

My dad is marrying his girlfriend of 2 years, Cindy and she has 2 kids which means that we will be moving into their house soon. Her house is much larger and in a great spot between the schools that my brother and I attend and her children attend. Our house is small but its just the 3 of us and is already set up for my wheelchair, open concept, ramps etc. The problem is her house isn't and there has been no effort made to do so.

It is a ranch style home with no large steps but the front and back doors have a bump which is very difficult to get my chair over, often I need someone to push/life me over. The 2 bathrooms are very small and have no support bars or room for my chair, I can go alone but its VERY difficult and timely.  The flooring in between rooms is bumpy, very narrow hallways etc. I can barley reach the kitchen sink unless I put my brakes and lift myself up to wash my hands, the cabinets are high up I need someone to get me dished down etc

Minor accommodations can be made to fix some of these issues but there will need to be big ones like the bathroom but there has been no attempt and we are moving in a month or two. My father idolizes Cindy. She is the love of his life and I feel he puts her first but that could just be me. He is a great father to us and always has been, when our mom died and he was alone for so long until Cindy came. She isn't much of a ""mother"" but she is nice person and seems friendly enough when she is around us but my brother and I feel like we are slowly being pushed out of the family and replaced by Cindy and her two children, they seem to dictate what we do, where we go, always something that want etc.

Dad argues that we had him for years growing up and since we are both adults the younger kids need him more then we do. Which is fine I'm moving out next Sept 2018 for college anyways and its nice to see my dad finally happy.
The problem is until then I will be living in Cindys house and I keep telling them they need to make changes but nothing has been done. They don't want to do all the repairs because her house is already really nice and it could be pricey renovations. Like redoing a bathroom just for me when i move out in a year.

But I already struggle when I'm there, I need someone to help me constantly. I can barley use the bathroom without it fearing I'm doing to fall or get stuck. Im not sure how to approach this or maybe I should just move out early on my own..

After some thinking and gathering A LOT of courage I told my girlfriend we needed to talk. She was pretty confused and already knew something was up, because she notices that kind of stuff. I started off with saying that she means a lot to me and that I love her (I don't know if this was too soon or not but it seemed like a good time in the moment). She immediately told me she loved me too and we hugged, felt pretty damn good.

I told her that I had something important to tell her and that it would probably hurt but to please hear me out. She looked pretty concerned at this point but I carried on. I said that prior to meeting her, I had some encounters with her friends A & B but that it's in the past now. She didn't understand and looked even more confused and I got embarrassed as hell, but told her straight up that I had met both of them through Tinder and that we did some stuff. She looked at me in disbelief and stammered a bit and asked me if I was joking.

Unfortunately I wasn't, and I carefully explained her what happened and she went quiet again and just looked at me. I noticed she was on the verge of crying so I hugged her, and she bursted out in tears. She hugged me very tight and it honestly broke my heart, I felt so so terrible. I held her for a long time and eventually she calmed down, and asked for the details. I didn't really want to talk about this but she really wanted to know so I gave in. She probably would have found out from her friends anyways so I told her everything. I doubled down that it meant nothing to me anymore and that I was with her to stay, and that I only want her and nobody else. She told me it was okay but that she needed some time to process it, I told her I would do anything to help her. We ended up cuddling all night and watching some Netflix, later she told how much she appreciated it so there's that.

She got a little bit emotional a few more times the past week but she handled it like a champ. Made sure to show her that I loved her many times and took her out to dinner. The party was yesterday and that went OK too. A had no clue it was me (until seeing me) and we were pretty awkward together. B had her suspicions and was really cool about it. Ended up talking with her for a great deal of the night and it was nice to catch up, she handled it way better and we shared some laughs. Afterwards my girlfriend told me she would prefer it if I didn't interact too much with B which is completely understandable, shouldn't have done that in the first place but definitely not doing that again. Overall I think it went pretty well and I'm so glad I told her myself, it could have gone way worse. Thanks y'all, cheers to a happy ending. I feel a stronger bond with her for sure.

TLDR: Ended up telling her about my experiences with her friends, her first reaction was pretty bad but eventually she calmed down. Party went OK, I definitely feel a stronger connection now. Girlfriend is a champ.

649,surrenderedknife,? Locked Post ?,3ky38l,1944,"Kayla and I have had a great run together. We both love one another, and we also push each other to do our best. I work in science in the lab, she is an administrative assistant who has her own craft business on the side (and she sometimes can pull more in from that than her meager secretary pay). 

In one of her craft groups, a woman talked about a book she'd read, and handed it off to Kayla. It was called Surrendered Wife or something close, and when Kayla read it, she was so into it.

She wants to essentially make that our relationship. If you don't know, it's basically where women give up any control in a relationship. They hand it all over to the ""man"" of the house, from sexual freedom to financial. They don't turn down their partners for sex no matter how they feel, they look to the man to control finances and make big decisions, basically whenever the man asks for the woman's opinion, she says 'Whatever you think,"" rather than having an opinion.

She's looking to have a more ""man of the house"" and ""breadwinner is man"" kind of relationship, and this is a HUGE change. It's not that she was controlling anything before, but she certainly didn't sit by and watch me run the show.

I've already told her that I'm not into this at all, that I prefer my future wife be her own person, and now just my shadow or yes-woman. But she keeps pushing for it, and she's even trying to ""slip"" it in so to speak. 

I have no idea what to do. This is absolutely not the kind of relationship I want -- my parents were equals, and their relationship is unbreakable and rock solid. I don't believe in having the woman be below me in a relationship, no matter what. I would be horrified to raise a child with someone who would bring the child up to believe she should be subservient to men.

&#x200B;

So, my original post didn't get a whole lot of traction, but it seemed that there were some posters who didn't think confronting K (or, really, having a friendly chat) was a great idea. However, I really felt miserable at work with all the tension, and people who knew much more about the situation than I was able to convey on Reddit urged me to do SOMETHING, so I did. 

&#x200B;

I waited until the end of the day on Friday. I even brought notes with me so that I didn't say anything stupid. I asked K to come into the hall and I basically went down the points on my notes: that I felt a lot of tension lately, (she agreed with that assessment but said that she wasn't about to do anything to address it) that I was sorry for snapping at her a few days earlier and it was unprofessional. I explained my reasoning why I was driven to that point--not as an excuse, but more of an explanation--that I felt (and perhaps I was wrong!) that she doesn't respect me as a coworker. 

&#x200B;

Her response? ""Yeah, because you make a lot of mistakes."" Ah, ok, so there it was. I was at the same time shocked and... well, not. It was a confirmation of what I'd suspected. I continued the conversation by stating that when I found mistakes that she makes, I don't go out of my way to make her feel bad about it, and don't doubt her abilities, but I just fix them. And I stated that we don't have to be best friends, and we should be looking out for each other and not working against each other. She begrudgingly agreed, said we were ""good,"" and that she has a tendency to overreact at things, but was overall kind of cool about the whole thing. I personally felt relieved but also personally kind of stung, that my performance at work was apparently so bad. 

&#x200B;

I spent the weekend thinking a lot about our conversation, and what I could do differently at work, performance wise--not just for her, but for myself. Because I feel better about myself when I do a good job (doesn't everyone?). I came back to work the next week and busied myself on making step-by-step notes on all of the most common things I do. A month later, I still refer to them. I know everything on them, it's just handy for me to refer to them so I don't forget. (I have ADHD, and that absolutely figures in to the mistakes.) A few days ago, while K was on vacation and our newest tech was training, I gave her a copy of the step-by-step notes for her to use for a task I asked her to do. To my delight, she used them all week, which made me feel like maybe the work we do is a bit harder than I give myself credit for. 

&#x200B;

I've also done my part in covering my own butt and letting other people know what is going on. Turns out K has been spreading quite a bit of gossip about me, which has made me look even worse because I don't really gossip. So everyone who thinks they know what's going on only gets one side. Last week I met with my boss for our regularly scheduled one-on-one session. It was the first time that I'd had one since our little spat. And I told her about my conversation with K. She was impressed that I'd been the bigger person and broached the topic with her. But she was appalled at K's response about feeling disrespected. In her mind (and mine), being respected at work is just a basic right, it shouldn't be tied into whether you're performing your job adequately or not. I told my boss about a couple other little episodes that K and I had had since that larger one, and that I'd defused the potential conflicts and not bit back--something that my boss was thankful for, and also complementary of. She stressed to me to let her know these things, because I'm pretty quiet and while she knew that K and I didn't really get along very well, she didn't know it was THAT bad. 

&#x200B;

So, taking that advice to heart, and emboldened by my great, stress-free week without K, I snagged one of the pharmacists before leaving last night. I told her that, in case she hadn't noticed, K and I don't get along that well (she rolled her eyes and stated that she and the other pharmacists had definitely noticed). I told her that I was only telling her all this because I wanted her to know that it had been going on for a while, and I hadn't really mentioned it because I figured she and the other pharmacists had better things to do than get involved or take sides in a spat. I told her that I was a little offended that K would even tell them before trying to work it out with me personally, because it seemed petty and juvenile. I told her a little bit about the ""mistake"" that I'd made that caused K to react so angrily and that it turned out it wasn't really even a mistake, just an accident that I'd never anticipated. And that while I don't complain to her about K and K DOES complain to her about me, to just try to keep an open mind and not assume that I was always in the wrong. She told me some enlightening things about K, that there had been problems with K before I even came along, and she knew more about the situation than I realized. She also reiterated that I do a good job overall and not to let K bring me down.

&#x200B;

So, I left work yesterday feeling great. A week without K, making a difference in training our new tech, taking the lead on some issues that popped up, and showing that I could be just as good--if not better--a worker than K, without the drama. Basically, the best week I'd had in a long time. And in regards to K, it's the best I could hope for. I know she'll never like me. And that's ok, because she's such an irritable and unpleasant person that I don't really want her to like me. I just want to be able to do my job without her breathing down my neck all the time. At the very least, I've let other people--not everyone, but those who are in a position to know--about the issues we've been having. To get the burden off myself and put it on her. I've done all I can do, and I'm just glad that people have noticed. 

&#x200B;

Tl;dr talked with offending coworker, who outright admitted to disrespected me because apparently she thinks I'm a shit employee. At least I got her to admit it. Now I'm going to take care of myself and doing my job. I also let others know about the issues we've been having so they're aware. 

Second edit: so this gold thing, that's cool? Thanks bro.

EDIT: wow, I never imagined I'd get such a response! Thanks to everyone for your comments. I'm particularly proud of myself because at my last job I was even labeled by my boss as a 'troublemaker' so I've been working really hard to shed that image. I hope that when K comes back I'll be able to use my newfound confidence in how I handled this to make my work a little more pleasant. And yes, I would love a promotion. :) ",1554000446.0,Update: Bad coworker,0.96
651,Fedup1223,Relationships,3x78ym,1936,"I've been married to my wife for almost 11 years. We have one child. I'll get straight to the point. 

Basically my wife's father... Bob.. just disgusts me. He is extremely fat and walks around without a shirt on constantly. I would say that 70 percent of the time that I visited my wifes parents indoors he has been shirtless. He never showers, smells like death. He has god awful man boobs and has no shame about them. He burps all the time extremely loudly to the point where it is truly startling. They smell horrific. He does this on purpose just to piss people off. He picks his nose and rubs the boogers on tables, carpets, walls etc. Every single time he has visited my house I have discovered boogers all over the place in our guest room. Guess what? I'm the one who has to clean that up. 

He also gets very drunk every single Christmas that i have experienced with him. Just as side note, my wife and I have an arrangement where we spend Christmas eve with her parents and Christmas morning with my parents. Usually her parents will have large gathering including aunts uncles cousins nephews nieces grandparents great grandparents etc.

During these gatherings Bob is always shirtless. He has a giant hairy beer belly and like I stated before smells just horrid. He walks around like this in front of everybody including the children and always asks them if they would like to rub his belly. Needless to say the kids are always scared sh!tless and someone always starts crying and a scene of some sort is always made.

Bob gets very drunk during these gatherings/ holiday season in general. while Bob is drunk he flies into uncontrollable rages. A few things he has done during these rages include : 

-throwing my expensive gift for him in the garbage can right in front of me and telling me that I am wasteful with my money and that I would lead my wife into a life of debt 

-calling every single person in the room a n!gger after someone attempts to cut off his alcohol intake for the rest of the night 

-accusing his own 87 year old father of being a pedophile because he wants to see my child

-accusing me of being a pedophile 

-accusing his own disabled aunt who is in a wheelchair and can barely move of being an active pedophile and rapist

-purposefully burping in the faces of all of the young children who attend the gathering, including my son, who was literally crying and screaming  one time as Bob tried to force a burp into his face until I had to rip my child violently from Bobs death grip 

-refusing to eat the meal that was prepared, accusing my grandmother in law of trying to poison him

-pooping on the carpet, first trying to blame it on ME, and then trying to blame it on the dog who was outside all night 

So yeah, all of these things have accumulated over the span of 11 years and to say the least I am fed up and to be  quite frank the holidays have become a horrific time for me because of this. I cannot even enjoy the little time I have off of my job with my family because I am dreading seeing this man again. I work at a law firm and I deal with some strange things sometimes, but to this day the most disturbed person I have ever encountered is Bob

My wifes whole family brushes over this behavior and tries to make excuses for him, saying that he went to war and has PTSD etc. And you know what, that is sad, I admit that it is sad that this man is suffering from PTSD and has for whatever reason not been given or sought out any sort of help for his problem. But I am sick of hearing that I am supposed to put up with his psychotic behavior because he has PTSD. 

My wife Sara makes excuses as well for him, and begs me every year to suck it up and come to the gatherings they throw for the holidays. This year I finally broke down and told her that she could go if she wanted to, but I was staying at home this year, and that she can just tell everyone I'm sick. And it was partly true, because I have been suffering lately with migraine headaches, and they often come out of nowhere. I'm not about to risk the possibility of a migraine coming on as I'm trying to deal with Bobs disturbing behavior. 

Sara is very upset with me and continues to try to guilt me Into going to the gathering. To be perfectly honest it is disappointing for me to have my own wife not support me on this... And to act as if she has not witnessed this behavior the past decade. But she is making me feel like I am not being supportive of her and I am starting to feel guilty about my decision. 

I guess I am just asking for support here and some advice. Maybe someone can share their in law story too so I feel slightly less alone and pathetic... The prospect of spending part of this holiday season alone without my wife and child truly depresses me. Just makes me feel like a loser. The only enjoyment I get out of this time of year is all the time I get to spend with my family... It really means a lot to me and I want my son to grow up having these memories witb me. Should I just suck it up? Fck I don't even know anymore.

That life has never included children. I knew what I wanted out of my life, and as soon as I could find a doctor who would do it, I got sterilized. Rick has had a vasectomy.

His family did not know this about us until recently. It has come up in a far-off sense, but we found it fit to finally tell them that their desire for grandchildren, nieces nephews or whatever else, is unfortunately not going to happen. 

It all went down at a party, like these things often times do. When hanging with Rick and his family at a cookout, someone asked us about wedding plans. We are planning a fun wedding, and it's fun to talk about the things we're doing. At some point, his sister chimed in with, ""After the wedding, how long before I get to be an aunt?"" 

Rick and I looked at each other for a moment to confirm we wanted to do this, and we both nodded. I said, ""Oh, there aren't going to be any children.""

People of course didn't believe us and were saying the usual ""you'll change your minds!"" and ""it's different when they're your own!"" and ""what would you even do if you didn't have kids?"" We listened politely, but when people were done, we made it very clear, once again, that this was a joint decision and that we had made the necessary precuations. They didn't know what this meant, and as soon as I said I was sterilized, the tides turned.

Cue the ""how COULD you do that?"" and everything under the sun. We were called selfish and arrogant, etc etc etc. This hurt to hear from a family I've been close to since before we were together. Rick put an end to it and let everyone know that the topic of our fertility is, as of that moment, off-limits, as there is no reason to discuss it. His family accepted this and moved on, but his sister kept giving me these looks the rest of the time. 

I wasn't prepared for what came in the following weeks. Phone calls, emails, texts, and FB messages from people across his family telling us that they are no longer coming to our wedding because they cannot support the choice we've made. The only people who have not declined are his mother and father. His sister has organized this whole thing because she feels personally attacked by this because she cannot have children and somehow that's my problem. 

I am hurt that along with this, we have been told we can't babysit for one of the kids in the family anymore. My fiance and I are artists who have been teaching the little girl all about the world of art. She loves her time with us and we enjoy being able to instill a love of creativity in her. But according to the child's mother, she doesn't feel she can trust a woman to take care of a child if she would ""remove her womanhood"" or something like that. 

Our wedding with an estimated 115 guests is now a wedding with 32 guests. His family was the bulk of it because I come from a small, tight-knit family and many of my friends cannot afford to fly out, etc. 

I feel so sad over all of this, but especially for Rick. He's seeing a terrible side of his family that he's never seen before, and I don't know what to do to help it feel better.

Thank you to everyone who replied, inboxed me, and gave their input on my original post. I especially appreciate those of you who gave me solid tips on how to bring it up to her parents.

So, it's been Christmas holidays now and I hadn't had much time to do anything because of family events. However, yesterday I finally was able to get a break. I decided to talk to Cara's parents in person. Since they live relatively close, it wasn't an issue. Cara was away for the weekend on a ski/cabin trip and I knew she wouldn't be back until later Sunday evening. It provided a great opportunity to talk to her parents calmly and without an interruption from her.

I basically did what many of you suggested. I took examples from social media, I took conversations that were had on facebook, I showed them her blog entries where she had gone on long tangents about being Japanese and reuniting with her real father in Japan. It was a very loooong conversation. I told them all about the high school years and what happened in the time afterward. I told them about her lying about her parents, about keeping her parents and friends separate, about her plan to go live in Japan, about just everything I could think of. They let me speak, and they were actually very good about it. Her father was understandably very hurt and heartbroken that his daughter would deny him like that, and her mother was furious. They both talked to me about Cara and her home life, how she was usually in her room and never really mentioned any of this Japanophilia to them.

We discussed what to do about the situation. Everyone agreed Cara needs therapy and need to come to terms with the reality of her heritage. Her parents believe that she is delusional and could benefit from seeing a professional. They said they were going to confront her that evening.

So it's been a day now and I haven't heard anything yet, but I will update as soon as I hear from them. They both promised to call me and update about the situation and they thanked me for telling them and being a concerned friend.

Will post another update with the aftermath. As of now, Cara has deleted her facebook, but not yet messagd me. i dont know if they actually told her who exposed her, but it will probably come back to me.

654,tindergonewrong,Non-Romantic,792yji,1938,"After high school I moved out of state for college. I always kept in touch with my best friend Anna and we kept each other informed about guys we were seeing and all that stuff. After college (about 6 months ago) I moved back to my home state but an hour away from my hometown. About a month ago I decided, since I was settled finally, to start getting back into the dating game so I joined Tinder.


Instantly I met this really awesome guy named John. It turns out that John was up in my part of the state for work but that he actually lives in my hometown. I started to realize that he looked familiar and ask if we went to elementary school together or if he attended my church as a kid. He said he just moved to the state a couple years ago and I chalked it up as him having ""one of those"" faces.


We started chatting and hit it off pretty quickly. I told him I wasn't big into social media and he said he wasn't either so we exchanged numbers and started texting to communicate. Even though he lived an hour away he commutes to my town a lot for work and since neither of us were looking for anything serious we figured this was a pretty awesome set up. After a while our conversations turned a bit sexual with some sexy pics being sent from his side and comments about hooking up when he came back. We set up a date to have lunch and meet when he got back.


During this time I had told Anna all about him and when I finally told her we were going to meet up she asked for a picture. I sent her one (not one of the sexy ones, obviously) and was surprised to find out that she had dated him for a short time (couple of weeks) a few years back. I asked if she was okay with me seeing him and she said she didn't care but that she was positive he had a girlfriend. She sent me his full name so I could find him on Facebook and sure enough he was in a relationship. I was pissed.


I instantly sent him a message confronting him. He apologized and profusely and said it was a mistake to talk to me on Tinder. I told him he should be apologizing to his girlfriend which he begged me not to tell. I told him to fuck off and blocked his number.


After that I screenshot all the messages we had sent including him admitting to his guilt and sent his girlfriend a Facebook message. I told her I felt awful for having even a small role in his potential infidelity and that I thought she should know. I haven't gotten a message back and I don't think I will. But I felt what I did was the right thing to do.


Fast forward to a couple days ago when I came back home and went out for lunch with Anna. She asked me what ending up happening with John and I told her. She instantly got furious and started saying stuff like I had ""no business interfering with another person's relationship"" and ""how could I destroy a relationship I wasn't part of."" I got really defensive and told her that he *made* me part of their relationship when he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with me. She told me I was disgusting and an awful person for what I did and that I had no business messaging John's girlfriend then paid and left. She hasn't talked to me since.


I feel like I did the right thing but the way Anna reacted and how she refuses to talk to me anymore is making me question everything. Was I right to get involved and message his girlfriend? How can I get Anna to talk to me again?


**TL;DR**: Met a guy on Tinder, turns out he had a girlfriend, message his girlfriend with screenshots and told her, best friend thinks I shouldn't have meddled and that I'm awful for doing so and won't talk to me. Did I do the right thing? How do I get my best friend to talk to me again?

655,throwaway113006,Relationships,4338dm,1935,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. So i've been with my SO for 7 years, lived together for 6, we have our ups and downs like every other couple, however these last few months have been more than I can bear.

It started 5 months ago when my SO got an unexpected phone call from her cousin who she hadn't heard from in years saying that she needed to get out of the town she lived in, needed a fresh start. Yadayadayada. My SO said yes first, then asked me, putting me in a position where if I said no I would look like a total ass.

Anyway I said yes on the condition that she pay a third rent, a third utilities and a third food. This didn't happen from the get go, instead it she paid nothing for food, nothing for utilities and paid rent sporadicly in whatever amount she felt like. 

This happened for the first month that she was there. At about this time I started asking both my girlfriend and the cousin about rent etc. The response was that the cousin was in massive debt and couldn't afford to pay. By this time the cousin had got a job paying more than I do (I'm a student working part time). So my response, was 'bullshit its not my responsibility to bore the burden of her debt'. 
It was about this time that my girlfriend started being manipulated by her cousin and began growing distant, hanging out with the cousin more, and so on.

Fast forward to about a month ago, and me and my SO hardly talk at all. My SO and her cousin hang out in what ever room i'm not in and when we do hang out the cousin manipulates the conversations we have into fights that don't get resolved, making the situation worse. I've tried to tell my SO that she is being manipulated, but she shrugs it off claiming I'm being an asshole, as the cousin is a master at putting on a nice front.

Last week I started staying at my folks house, because I was tired of being in a relationship where I was totally alone. I haven't even received even so much as a text from my SO since. 

I've talked to our friends about it and they have told me i've gotta kick the bitch out. I'm thinking of leaving as I can't see myself marrying my SO due to the lack of loyalty that I've received from her during this period.     


   
**tl;dr**: My SO's cousin moved in and destroyed my relationship by manipulating my SO over the course of 5 months, should I stay or should I go? 

EDIT: So I don't know if this changes much, but my SO kicks in half for everything she is pretty good in terms of paying her own way, it's pretty much the cousin who is the drain in all this.

EDIT 2: thanks for all of the responses i'm going to give my SO a call and go my own way, it was good to get an outside perspective on the whole deal.

EDIT 3: I'm gonna call tonight and post the update tomorrow as i'm gonna get properly wasted afterward. I will keep you all posted, thanks for all of the advice, it means a lot. 

UPDATE: So I went round to the house last night because I feel that talking over the phone for something of this magnitude was a bit soft. Basically I aired my grievances and she completely agreed. Going on I said that I would be moving out over the next week and I don't think she grasped the gravity of the situation because she didn't seem to care. Any way after I said my piece I got absolutely wankered at the pub and while I was there I ran into my brother who i'm pretty close to. Turns out his room mate is moving interstate and he was looking for someone to share a house with, so he hit me up to move in. 

I can't say that i'm completely happy as I was really looking to get married and start having kids within the space of the next 18 months and i'm kinda scared that it might not even happen considering i'm leaving my run a little bit late on a count of my age. I do however have the feeling that a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders, that and a massive hangover that is gonna stay with me all day. Thanks to all that sent messages, the last couple of months have been some of the toughest i've ever faced. Hopefully 2016 will do a 180 and I can start kicking its ass.",1453986798.0,My [32m] girlfriends [29f] cousin [27f] has manipulated my girlfriend to the point that I am thinking about walking away after 7 years together.

656,,Updates,3spgpq,1935,"Sorry for how long it took to post an update but I didn't expect my post to get so much attention and it took awhile for it to come off the front page.

Here is the link to the original post:https://nr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3s5moz/i_24_f_am_the_daughter_of_a_woman_who_had_a_long/

I want to thank everyone who took the time to comment, even the haters and just generally overall rude and tacky people. Most of you were kind and supportive and helped me think the whole thing through.

I really didn't appreciate all the nasty comments directed at my mother, she's really a kind and sweet woman who I dearly love who has made a few bad choices in life and is too immature/emotionally damaged to see it. At least she didn't abandon me like my ""dad"" did. That was also the first and only married man she has ever had any kind of relationship with. However I know this is Reddit and a subset of this community just loves any opportunity to judge and bash women for any mistake and think they deserve eternal damnation. I guess it was to be expected.

Also clarifying, Mike's dad was actually my FMIL's SECOND husband. Her first husband cheated on her with a stripper but that is NOT Mike's dad. Mike's dad also cheated but it wasn't with a ""sex worker."" It was a mutual friend or coworker or something like that, not sure on the details. Mike is No Contact with his father and does not like to talk about him so I don't ask.

Anyways, on to the actual update. I actually showed Mike the post. He was quiet but kind, asked me to let him think on it and then cooked me my favorite dinner and drew me a bath with scented oil and candles. About a day after I posted Mike asked me to sit and talk with him.

He started off the bat by sincerely apologizing. He said the things his mother said to me and my mom were so awful and brazen he was taken aback and froze up in response. He said that yes his mom has made the odd snippy comment about me or my mom but he's been good about deflecting the comment and changing the subject. He just never expected an explosion of that magnitude.

He then apologized for not addressing his mother sooner but it's been so hard for him to wrap his mind around it. That he deeply loves and respects his mother and it has been so hard to think about the implications of her actions and what it could mean for his relationship with her. However, his life is with me now and that if he thinks he's grown up enough to get married he needs to put me first, regardless of his mother.

I will say I can understand why Mike is so close with his mom. I'll be the first to say I do not like my FMIL but she has many admirable qualities about her. She's very tough and ambitious and strove to make Mike have a happy and successful life despite two failed marriages and being a single mom. She is quite successful career wise. She's just too closed minded and controlling for me to ever like her much.

Anyhoo Mike said that none of what his mom said affected his view on me, that I'm amazing and beautiful and just perfect and he doesn't care what my background is, he's still marrying me and that will make him the happiest man on the planet (aww).

Mike asked me to sit right there on the sofa. He then got his phone and called his mother. I'll relay the main conversation.

Mike: ""Mom, hi, I'm calling because there is something I need to talk to you about. It's about what you've been saying about my fiancee and my future mother-in-law and what you said to their faces.""

FMIL: *starts to argue*

Mike: NO. Stop right now. I'm not going to listen to this bullshit anymore. Look, I know how much Tom and Dad hurt you. And I'm sorry about that. I really am. But taking it out on (my name) and her mom won't fix it or make it better. Jezebel (my mother) isn't the one who cheated on you. And (my name) didn't exactly choose to be born into the life she's had. Don't you think if she had a choice she'd have done different?""

FMIL: *starts to argue and yell*

Mike: ""MOM. SHUT UP AND LISTEN.""

FMIL: *silence* (Mike's never talked that way to her ever).

Mike: ""(My name) is MORE than good enough for me. She's smart, successful, witty, ambitious and beautiful. She has a good heart and is going to do amazing things. She's all this IN SPITE of her 'past.' And you know what mom? If you think she'll cheat on me because of her parents relationship, then I guess I'm bound to cheat on her too because MY dad was a cheat and my mom had the bad judgement to marry two cheaters in a row.""

FMIL: ""What? But...there were consequences! You weren't born from it. And I got them both out of my life...I never said it was ok! It's different! You saw how it was bad to cheat, she was raised thining it's ok"" (Mike said she sounded really shaken up)

Mike: ""And (my name) DIDN'T have consequences? Because her dad cheated he abandoned her! Because of infidelity she had to grow up without a father! Do you think (my name) WANTED that?!?""

FMIL: *silence. Starts to speak*

Mike: ""No. This conversation is finished. If you still want a place at the wedding you will drop this topic today, immediately, forever. You don't have to love (my name) or her mother. You don't even have to like them. But you will treat BOTH of them with respect. If you don't you won't have a place in my life or the lives of any kids (my name) and I have. (My name) is my friend and partner and she will be my wife. Anything said against her is also said against me. And I won't have someone around who is disrespectful and cruel for no reason to me and her. Her mom is going to be my mom. I plan on calling Jezebel 'mom' because that's what she will be.""

FMIL: *silence then starts crying* (My MIL NEVER cries)

Mike: ""You owe (my name) an apology. You also owe her mother one but I can't control that. But I can control what happens in *my* house. I will not talk to you until you have apologized to (my name) and are ready to be civil to her and her mother."" *hangs up*

I was and still am speechless. My fiance is the kindest person in the world but he stood up for me AND my mother without backing down.

Oh and it doesn't stop there. Mike then called my mom and apologized for his mother's behavior and said he had talked to her and it shouldn't happen again but if it does to please not hesitate to tell him. He also asked if he could start calling her mom, and my mom said of course. I know this meant the world to her. He also sent her a big bouquet of flowers to her for her birthday which she should be getting sometime today or tomorrow.

My mom texted me later saying she wished she could have been loved like I am at any point in her life and to please not take what I had for granted. She said she is so happy for me and thinks Mike is the most wonderful guy in the world. I got all choked up and texted her back a thank you and that I thought so too.

Still haven't heard from FMIL but neither of us expect to for awhile. She hasn't communicated with Mike at all either which tells us she took what he said very hard. It'll probably take awhile for her to recover from it. My guess is she'll probably feel like I ""stole her son from her"" and have ""corrupted him"" but I guess that's what happens when you marry a conniving sin spawn like me. I really don't care and it isn't my problem. As long as she keeps her opinions about me and my mom to herself, I'll tolerate her for Mike's sake and any future kids we have. I know for a fact if she steps out of line Mike won't have any qualms about cutting her out so I'm not worried about it.

Anyways, thanks again Reddit, I wanted to share my happy update with you since most of ya'll were so good to me. Now getting ready to have lunch with Mike and start planning our wedding (bless his heart lol).

**TL;DR Mike apologized to me and my mother, and gave his mom a hard core talking to. Called her out on her BS and said he won't talk to her until I get an apology and that she is to never criticize me or my mother again unless she wants the boot from our lives. Sent my mom flowers for her birthday and now we have a wedding to plan!**

EDIT: Alright, taking this post down. Getting real tired of all the PM's and posts. My first one I had a bunch of misogynists, this time I've got people saying it's fake. Haters gonna hate. Sorry my writing isn't good enough, I don't know what you all wanted. Thank you for those who have been supportive and helpful. I'm happy to be with Mike and planning my wedding and don't need any more negativity than already exists. Congrats, you got your wish, I am signing off forever and there will be no post wedding update because I am sick to death of all the assholes on here being absolute dicks to me and my mother, and saying Mike is a figment of my imagination because he's ""too good to be real.""

My son's birthday party happened yesterday, and overall, it was good. 



A few days after the OP, my SO, daughter, mom, and I took my son to Party City to buy the decorations for his party. My mom is not comfortable with my son liking ""girly"" things, but I thought if I took her and saw the smile and excitement on his face that she would come over to the dark side. So, we get to Party City and I pretty much let the kids roam around, this is their domain and they will reign here. Unfortunately, there were no Shimmer and Shine decorations to choose from. So I asked my son if there was anything else he would consider since Shimmer and Shine didn't appear to be an option. He looked down the boys isle, and the girl's isle and he picked Peppa Pig. I was like ""Cool, decision made, let's get the stuff an go."" (I hate shopping. Like, for anything)


My mom was trying to convince my son to go with Jake and the Neverland Pirates, but my son was like ""Nah, I don't like Jake, I want Peppa Pig."" And I kind of just told my mom, ""that's it, he made his choice"" and she gave up and pursed her lips and walked away a few steps to let us finish buying the decorations. 


Anyway, come party time, literally NOBODY gave a damn lol. My parents were too busy cooking some carne asada, arroz, with frijoles, two kinds of really good, hot red salsa, and guacamole (they bought 30 lbs of meat for a party of about 50 people---WAYYY to much! But more for me I guess lol). My family was hovered around the food, and the kids were running around riding their bikes, trying to fly, taking turns with those prank jelly beans that could either taste like something normal, or some nasty alternative. I spent the day catching up with old friends and tending to the guests where I could. The party was small, because I hate huge parties, they are exhausting, but Nick (my son), seemed to have the perfect amount of kids running around with him.


The only thing that bugs me is that my brother was making comments to my son about ""asking mommy for some tampons."" I swear to God I wanted to smack the shit out of him. He thinks it's funny but it's not. I just told him to shut up and had my son run off with his buddies. I don't get it, I just don't get those comments (especially if they are addressed to little kids).  I think it's because he embraces more of that ""soy del rancho (i'm from the ranch)"" mentality than I do. He listens to narcocorridos (like Mexican country music is the best way I can explain it, feel free to correct me), and does all the stuff your typical chunti from Los Angeles does (again, someone translate what that means because IDK what they are in English lol). Anyway, I'm still in good terms with my brother, I understand he's flawed, but I'm sure I am too, and I still love that asshole no matter what. I'm working with my son on how to react when people make comments about his tastes in different things. I figure if I can't change my brother, I can change how Nick is affected by that stuff (and limiting time with his uncle when he's an asshole).


***Clarification: My brother is a good person, but like I said before, flawed, as are the rest of us. I'm sure I have terrible qualities myself that people would crucify me for. He did some college but chose to work instead after a year of college to help my parents out. He bought his first car on his own, helps my parents with bills, and even gave me money so I could move out on my own (saving up for a downpayment is hard, but the monthly payments are fine). He always takes my kids to amusement parks with his, and gives them things I wouldn't be able to because I struggle financially more than he does. It's not all financially based though. He is a happy dude who just wants to enjoy life with his friends, and wants to be surrounded by his family. He would give every ounce of himself for his family. I love him and am thankful for him, but I can still call him out on his shit, like he does to me. He's just more about being a man's man. I am more about being whoever you want to be and not being ashamed of it.  


Also, Peppa Pig isn't girly to me, but I guess compared to like TMNT, and Avengers, it's more tame, and maybe even meant for younger kids (at least for my family). I don't care what he watches as long as he's not running around screaming bad words and picking up bad manners or sexual stuff. ***

[First update after surgery](http://redd.it/35pnnu)

It's been a while since my last update but since you've all been so nice to me and my sister with your help and wonderful wishes I think I should give an update.

First about my sister's recovery: It has been more difficult than we've expected. She's had many side effects from the surgery and the speed that things are getting better is not as the doctors hoped. She has problems with movement and sensation in her left side, sleep problems, vision and hearing issues. She also used to have some mood issues but those are mostly resolved. Doctors expect her to make a full recovery though, but it may take some years of rehab and hard work. She has great motivation these days so we're very optimistic.

About parents, well I don't know where to start. They didn't make any contact until 3 weeks after the surgery. They were upset that my sister hasn't called them. I told them to piss off and don't contact us again. A week later they showed up at my sister's place, they didn't even know that she had moved out of her place and moved in with me, how could have they known when they don't care? They called me angrily asking where their 'daughter' is. I told them that maybe she died after the surgery and hung up. I know this was cruel but I couldn't play nice with them anymore. They called me again but I didn't answer. They came to my door, I opened the door but didn't let them in. I took a very strong punch in the face from my dad but I still didn't let them in and told them to fuck off and went inside. My dad threatened to break the door, I told them that I'm calling the police and if they do anything crazy they will be in jail for breaking and entering. They told me that I'm disowned and left.

My sister was sleeping during this. I told her everything and she was happy with how I handled it (which is all that matters to me). We had talked about what to do if something like happened. I'm not sad that they disowned me, we had disowned them long before that. It's just the two of us now.

659,Sonisajuggalo,Updates,28av66,1933,"Here is the  [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27vyt1/me_42_m_with_my_son_roger_16_m_has_started/)

First off, I got a lot of different advice and some personal messages from a number of people. Some of the advise has been helpful, some of it not so much. There was a particular user that said I was a piece of shit and didn't deserve children. I don't believe anything I said warranted such an accusation. Either way, thanks to everyone for the advice. 

Anyway, now for an update. So I showed my wife some of the responses on this thread. She was annoyed at first that I let strangers in on our problem, but seemed okay with it once she was done going through your responses. She was very shocked about what goes on at the festival she had agreed to let my son go to. We watching a couple of the videos posted and she was horrified by drug bridge the most. We agreed that my son would not be able to go without adult supervision. 

As for my wife and I not being on the same page, she agrees with myself and some of you that we need coupled therapy to see if we can figure our a better resolution to disagreements about our children. I made the appointment this morning as I didn't want to wait until we just decided we didn't need it. Some of you probably know how that goes. 

One user sent me a personal message who had actually gone on tour (as a supporting band I believe) at some point with ICP and had some interesting and good insight on them. I won't go into who it was but he he was a pretty decent sounding guy and I realize that the problem here has little to do with the music my son is listening to. It is more about something he is going through and we need to figure it out along with him and help him. 

Now for our son. After my wife and I talked about the situation, we decided it be best if we had a friendly conversation with our son. One that would not include yelling from my wife or myself, even if our son raised his voice. We were going to tell him our decision on the concert and see if we could find common ground on a few of the other issues. 

So last night, we sat him down when he had gotten back from hanging with his female friend. She came with him as she needed to grab something that was in is room. She had a DVD case in her hand when she left, so I'm assuming that is all it was. Before she left, I did apologize to her about yelling at her the other day. I didn't apologize about calling the cops. I know there are mixed feelings on this. To be clear, I flushed the cocaine before the police arrived and had no idea that my son had pot on him. I initially called the cops because his friend refused to leave. I had no intention on having anyone arrested, I just wanted someone who I asked (well yelled at) to leave didn't. It is possible if I smoke calmly when I asked her, it would have worked out better for all of us. 

Anyway, back to the point. So she seemed a bit surprised as did our son. She left shortly after and that is when we asked our son if we could have a chat. He resisted at first and tried to walk away, but I said ""Please son, I just want to talk. I'm not going to yell. I just want to know what I can do to be a better father."" 

It worked, even if he looked annoyed. Before I got into the drug use or ICP and face paint stuff, I asked him if he was alright. I asked him if he needed to talk to someone (therapist, me, his mother). He kind of just sat there. My wife asked him the same thing, with different phrasing so to see if she could get him to open up. 

At this point he started to tear up and I could tell he wanted to say something. I shut my mouth though, and continued to let my wife work on him opening up. Since we have been clashing, I didn't want to ruin this opportunity. After a few minutes, he basically stated he was still having a hard time about his friends death. I won't go into many detail but he said he had stopped going to the therapist before because he just didn't feel like it was helping. All this time, my wife and I thought he had moved forward with that, yet he was still trying to work through it. 

He cried, my wife cried, I cried. We all cried and after several months of him not allowing me not to hug him, he let me. It was a hug that lasted for a few minutes. I felt like I had my son back and that he had me back as well. From everyone's comments, I really needed to realize that while I am not a bad father, I needed to work on being better. I feel like this was a good first step. 

So after this part of our conversation, we got onto the other serious issues such as the drug use. I asked him why he had cocaine in his room. He then said I shouldn't have gone through his stuff and that I needed to respect his privacy. I told him I was concerned for him and that was the only reason I did it. I told him that cocaine is a dangerous drug and that I know from personal experience. He seemed taken back by this and gave me a confused look. I told him that I had a drug problem, specifically cocaine, and explained how messed up I was before I got help and before I met his mother. He looked shocked that I could relate a bit to him in regards to drug use. I told him we just wanted to make sure he was safe. 

I asked him how long he was doing it and to my surprise he said he has never done it. He told us that it wasn't his. He said that a friend of his (not the girl, but in same circle of friends) gave it to him and was pressuring him into trying it but he hadn't had the desire to try it. I calmly asked him if this friend was a drug dealer. For me, that was the only thing that made sense on why he would try to get my son hooked on such an expensive, and very dangerous drug. 

Of course, the answer was yes. At this point, I didn't have a reason not to believe him because he was being very open about everything. I did however ask him if he would do a random drug test if I asked him. He said yes, but that it would show that he has been smoking pot. 

It is a relief knowing that he wasn't doing cocaine. I can deal with the pot a lot easier than having to get him off of cocaine. After discussing this, my wife and I were both still pretty calm so we moved to the final part of our conversations. The ICP issue. 

My wife started this part off by apologizing to me for giving the okay to let him go to the festival. She then pulled up one of the videos on her ipad and handed it over to him. She told him to watch it. I think he knew where this was headed because he looked kind of upset. After the video, she then told him that we both decided it was not a good idea for him to go to this festival without an adult. 

He was upset ( no yelling)at first but I had one last idea to maybe get him to understand why. I pulled up the personal message from this guy from a band that toured with ICP and let him read it. Apparently, he knew of the band and the guy and this got through to him better then my wife or I could. My wife and I agreed that depending on his reaction, we could try to work it out to MAYBE my son and I would go for a day. There were a few factors that we needed to work out for this to happen. When we told him this, he took it better then we thought. He did ask if he could take his girlfriend (found out that they were dating at this moment). We said that we would have to speak with this girls parents and get to know her better. He agreed to that and I am currently trying to work the concert part out. Many might disagree with me, but if I am there, I can make sure he and his girlfriend aren't getting into trouble. 

Now we understand that no all of the ICP culture is bad, so we are compromising with him a bit on the face-paint and music part of it. We asked if he would consider not wearing the face-paint all the time when we go out. We explained that while it doesn't embarrass us, it does cause a distraction. He agreed that when we go out to family functions or family dinners, that he would not wear it, but would still most likely wear the t-shirts. We thought it was a good compromise. 

Things are headed in a positive direction and my relationship with my son has gotten better over the last 24 hours. There are still some things to work out, but I appreciate everyone's input on this, even if it was calling me a piece of shit parent. I hope that after some time, he will try to stay away from these bad influences in his life like his drug dealing friend. My hope is that once I give his girlfriend a chance and stop judging her simply from the ICP culture, that I can actually like her. 

Some of you might be disappointed that I didn't throw him in juvie and make him give up on the juggalo culture, but he needs to find himself and I need to do my best to be there for him. He is a good kid that just happened to find the wrong people to call his friends. I won't consider his girlfriend a bad influence quite yet. I need to get to know her better. 

Thanks for reading.

His parents are super chilled (as are mine) and just last year we had a loose discussion about marriage in general and his mom said we were too young and should enjoy our lives and save up for a house and vacations etc. His mom has always advised against marriage and always used to go on about how young we are and how much is ahead of us etc. 

Lately, his mom has been having several private specialist appointments with doctors and his parents are spending their savings. We know this because his brother [18M] told us and he is worried. 

I was with my SO at his parents? house last month. Literally out of the blue, she said ?you know you guys should get married, I would love to see that?. She sounded serious and a little downtrodden tbh so I thought my SO had told her something that made her doubt our relationship but he denied this. I made a joke about us being young but she was super serious. She looked depressed. 

Last week, I went to lunch with her and she said something about us being good parents ?one day? and ?I can?t be around for all of it but I wish I could be?. I wanted to ask her what she meant but in the moment I thought I was overthinking things.

Thanks everyone who responded to my last post. I know it wasn't super exciting or dramatic but I really appreciated the perspective, especially from the two people who had experienced similar feelings in new relationships.

Pretty much right after making that post I was distracted and stopped responding because my partner became incredibly sick. As I mentioned in a comment he was back in his home country visiting family for Christmas/New Years. While there he was bitten by a mosquito and contracted a pretty serious viral disease. He spent most of his vacation in and out of the hospital and on bed-rest.

That having happened kind of caused a shift in my frame-of-mind. I was no longer anxious about the relationship, I was just anxious about him and his health. I checked in on him every day (before that I was texting fairly infrequently, not wanting to be a bother during his vacation), took some time off work for when he arrived home so I could help around his place/make sure he was eating okay and I've accompanied him to the hospital a few times now due to him continuing to experience issues from the original disease and have more time booked off worked to attend upcoming appointments with him.

Due to all of this getting thrown at as out of no where we've gotten a **lot** closer. We've started spending a lot more time together, I've met his parents, we've exchanged 'I love yous', we're planning a vacation together and biggest of all we're now planning to move in together this summer once the lease on my place is up.

I think before we were both so worried about moving too quickly for the other person and scaring them off that we were both playing it cool and feeding into each other's insecurities.

I still have some anxiety sometimes, but he's just so great, so consistently, I get over it pretty quickly now and it's easier to recognise that it's my own insecurities rather than it looming.

So overall things didn't go exactly as planned, but I'm hopeful his medical issues will be sorted out soon and romantically things honestly couldn't be better!

**Original tl;dr:** Girlfriend from France invited to Thanksgiving and Christmas, then uninvited from Christmas after Thanksgiving...family insists she didn't do anything wrong but that they feel uncomfortable having someone who isn't family at our holiday gatherings. I'm not sure how to tell Sandrine or what to do.

I really appreciate everyone's response to my post! I was starting to feel a little crazy and felt like I was being selfish not wanting to spend Christmas with my family, so I appreciate having other people validate the situation.

Basically, I called my mom and asked her what the deal really was. I said that she was the one who wanted Sandrine over, and it doesn't make sense to un-invite her and have treated her coldly at Thanksgiving. I told her that it not only embarrassed me, but was flat out rude to Sandrine. She maintains her story of ""it's uncomfortable having non-family"" at holiday events. It seems like most people think my sisters convinced my mom to un-invite her because they were uncomfortable - for multiple reasons, either that they don't like her or are self conscious about being single - and I think that if that's the case, my mom is sticking to it and isn't budging. I asked if it had anything to do with them and her response was: ""Of course not!"" Lol. 

I told her I wanted to spend the holiday with Sandrine and that she was putting me in a really awful position having to figure out how to break this bad news to her. My mom asked if we can just talk about this again sooner to the holiday and if we could drop the topic for now. Whenever she knows I'm right about something she tries to delay the actual conversation so I said absolutely not because if we're not coming over for Christmas, then I need to know now so that I have time to tell Sandrine and also time to plan something fun for us to do. She said I was being ""unreasonable"". My sisters both texted me in our group chat - a couple hours after my phone call with my mom - and asked why I'd choose my girlfriend over them. The whole ""blood is thicker than water"" thing. I'm not responding. The sad part about this is that Sandrine had texted me a screenshot of the presents she got my sisters asking if I thought they would like them (this was right before my mom told me she was un-inviting her from Christmas). I had forgotten about that at the time of writing my original post. So now in addition to telling her we aren't spending the holidays with my family, I need to figure out how to help her return the gifts. 

My issue is that I feel like it might make the most sense to say that I'm having some trouble with my mom and sisters right now (which is true) and I would rather not see them at the holidays and would rather spend time with her. This would avoid having to involve her in the reasoning for not going. She wouldn't feel bad about them ""not liking her"" and she wouldn't feel guilty for being the reason I'm not spending the day with them, which were two things a lot of people brought up in their comments. 

The thing is, she will still want to send them the gifts she bought. She'll probably want to mail them because she won't want to look rude not giving them gifts. Does anyone have any tips on this end? Not only do they not deserve her gifts, I don't want her spending money on people who were so thoughtless and rude to her. 

I'm looking into what we can do for the holidays and really appreciate the suggestions! We're on the west coast so unfortunately the New York trip is not feasible for us, but I've still got a few other good ideas :)

I am really hoping someone can help me with this.
I'm very socially awkward, from childhood, but made worse from an abusive (emotionally/mentally controlling and intimidating) relationship. The only friend I had was my ex's friend which fell apart after I got away from him.

My last job had lots of client contact which was fine as I have a ""professional persona"" that I put on, and I had an office to myself that was out of the flow of traffic, my colleagues often forgot I was there. I tend to self isolate anyway so didn't often join for lunch or other breaks.

I recently started a new job which I absolutely love, but it's an open plan and the current staff (all female) are very close.

They are so lovely and inclusive of me and have friended me on fb and I have even exchanged numbers and texts, all initiated by them, even picking me up something on their morning coffee run before I get there.

They obviously care about each other, and are showing the same interest in me, but I've got zero social skills. I find myself spending the conversation planning what I should say to show the appropriate amount of interest without being nosey, or what I can say to sound interesting so that they will want to keep talking or monitoring my facial expressions, and as a result sometimes miss what they actually say. It all sounds very weird, I know.

I've spent years being made to feel like my needs are less than unimportant, so to have them consider me (staying back to wait for me when I'm running late etc) I feel anxious, like I'm putting them out.

I've been in therapy for the last 12 months and come a long way, but due to my new job I am not able to go very often.

I have always wanted friends, especially women friends, but I've never had the courage to pursue anything due to not knowing what to say and feelings of worthlessness.  

I tried bumble bff and all the women I've matched with and started conversations with have just stopped responding (8), so I feel like I don't have much to offer or I'm very interesting.

Is there anything I can do to improve socially? These women are so lovely, and I feel so excited they are so welcoming and wanting to be friends, I'm just scared I'll do or say something weird and freak them out, I just want to be a good friend.

Sorry this got kinda long. I hope I don't sound too weird, twelve months ago I wouldn't have been able to get this far, my fear and awkwardness made me come across as cold and uninterested. So this is pretty huge for me.

664,anne2k,Non-Romantic,46n2mr,1931,"I am living in a dorm this year, and I am a freshman in college. I live with 2 roommates in a single room, Jess and Lisa. We're friendly with each other, but I'm not close friends with them. They're best friends with each other though. The floor I'm living on has girls and guys on it, girls in the north wing and guys in the south wing. The hallways of each wing open into a large lounge, which separates the girls and guys rooms. 

 A lot of people on our floor go out and party every weekend (Thursday through Saturday) and while they can be a little annoying when they come back drunk and wake us up, my roommates and I don't really have anything against them.

Yesterday, late Thursday night, my roommates and I were woken up at 3 am by screaming in the lounge. Along with most of the floor, we got up and wandered over to the lounge to see what was going on. We were pretty annoyed because we were tired. I even had a test the next morning, in bio, and I had hoped to get a good night sleep. 

Two really drunk guys from my dorm were shouting at each other; one had apparently insulted the other and they were freaking the hell out at each other. Basically yelling about how they were gonna kick each others asses, but not actually doing anything but yelling and pushing each other a bit. 

A couple other guys on the floor tried to break it up, but the guys ""fighting"" were way bigger then they were so they weren't able to. Another kid who also ad a midterm the next morning was trying to reason with them to keep quiet, but they would not listen. 

This continued for about half an hour, these guys shouting at each other but not actually coming to blows, and more and more people came to watch. A lot of us were pretty annoyed, just wanting to go to bed again. The RAs (Residence Admins) for the building were nowhere to be seen. 

My two roommates had gone downstairs to a friend's room to sleep on her floor, but I didn't go with them. I'm way too light a sleeper to fall asleep on a floor. 

I was getting really sick of being kept up by their bullshit posturing (Over half an hour of it by then) and, realizing nobody was going to be able to stop it in time for me to get some sleep before my bio exam, I called out ""I've got a test tomorrow morning. If you don't get the hell out of here, I'm calling the cops."" 

Neither of the guys even looked at me, but a lot of the onlookers looked over in surprise. I stood there for about 10 seconds waiting to see if the guys who were fighting would acknowledge me, and when they didn't, I turned around and walked away to my room. A couple girls who were friends of the guys followed me, they were really drunk and were trying to tell me not to. One of them fell down halfway down the hall and her friend stopped to help so they didn't come to my room. 

I went into my room, locked up, and called the cops anonymously. (Remember, my roommates were gone for the night so I was alone.) I basically said there were two drunk 18 year olds (Drinking age is 21 here) about to beat each other up on the 10th floor of (my dorm room). I got ready for bed again. Within 10 minutes the fighting had stopped, and I fell asleep. 

This morning, I got up to take my test, my roommates still gone, and did great on it! I didn't go back to my dorm until late this afternoon, having classes and a club meeting. I got back and my roommates immediately asked me if I'd really called the cops. 

I said yeah, and they were pissed. They said that in the time I had been asleep, and out to class, the 2 guys in the fight had been kicked out of on-campus housing permanently. Also half the floor, a lot of their friends included, had been written up for underage drinking. One of my roommates, Jess, had a boyfriend who had gotten his second (out of 3) underage drinking strikes that night from my school. (You only get 3 for all 4 years of college) 

The rest of the floor is pretty pissed at me too; last night, immediately after I announced I was going to call the cops, a bunch of people went looking for my room to convince me not to, but with my roommates gone, nobody knew my room number. While I had heard people in the halls, I hadn't realized that was what they were doing. My being gone all today just escalated stuff too, I think. 

While my close friends live in other dorms and haven't been affected by this whole shitstorm, my roommates are mad at me, and a lot of the people on my floor and all their friends are furious at me. They're the ones I've got to live with for the rest of the semester, and I don't know how to handle it.

I didn't mean to get all them written up for drinking. I don't care that the two guys fighting got in trouble (Having grown up with family with anger management issues, violence and disrespect is something I have no patience for) but it all escalated way more than I expected. 

I haven't gone back to my dorm since speaking with my roommates; I'm spending the night at a friend's apartment since I don't want to have to deal with all the drama going on back at my own dorm. But after tonight, I don't know what I should do?

TLDR - I called the cops on two guys shouting and threatening to fight each other at 3 am in my dorm, since they were keeping me up before a midterm. When the cops came, half my floor was written up for drinking underage and the two guys in the fight are now kicked out of the dorm permanently. Everyone on my floor is furious with me, my roommates included. What should I do/say?

I really need a place to vent & ask for advice. So my younger brother is going to college this August 2015, my mother is asking & expecting me to pay for his college tuition & living costs even though I'm still paying for my student loans.

My older sister, 26, is in her last year of pharmacy school and will graduate this May. Her pharm school tuition + living cost are about 60k/year and my parents are helping her 40k/year because they don't want her to be in too much debt when she graduate. She went to a private university far away from home for her undergrad and the cost was 30k/year, which my parents were paying for it entirely. I went to a public university close to home (20 mins) for my undergrad where I got very good scholarships that I have extra money left + I have a part time job. My mother is a SAHM and my dad has a decent paying job. 

Background: My mother always compares me vs my sister ever since we were young. My sister & I are very different in personality wise and look wise. During my teen years, I suffered from cystic acne for 7 years & I have scoliosis so when I walk, I limp a little. My mother and my sister would constantly verbally abused me during my teen years about my acne and scoliosis. Therefore, I wasn't confident with myself and I usually look down when talking with someone, after a while it becomes a habit. One time her friend came to visit and asked why I always looked down & why I limp when I walked, my mother said it's because I have many acne and I choose to walk that way. It is partially true that I like to look down, but I didn't choose to walk like that, because of my scoliosis one of my leg is shorter than the other and when I try to walk straight, it hurts. I explained that and she ignored me. After that I rarely come out of my room or attend any event with my family. The past 2-3 years, I have been acne-free and it was a boost to my confidence. Last Christmas, I went to the family gathering at my uncle?s house and a lot of my relatives couldn?t recognize me but they were giving me compliments until my mom went ballistic. She started yelling at me that it?s because I?m selfish and I don?t care about anyone and that is why I didn?t attend any family gathering hence why they can?t recognize me. I was extremely humiliated, cried and left. My mother has always have a strong bond with my sister, they do many mother-daughter activities that I?m left out of. When I started graduate school and my tuition was 40k/year, I asked my parents for help financially with living costs because I know they can?t afford sister?s & my tuition at the same time. My mother got angry and started saying that I?m selfish because I only care about myself, that I don?t think for my sister?s future and I enjoy making my parents feeling inadequate for being poor. So I took out student loans and never ask for any help again. But my mother didn?t stop there, she told my sister the story and my sister went off at me, calling me a spoiled princess because I went through undergrad being debt free so I?m more fortunate than most of the population out there therefore now it?s time for me to live the ?real world?. I graduated with 2 master?s degree last year and was very fortunate to land a good job. I also moved out with my longtime boyfriend who paid off my student loan for me so I don?t have to pay interest. Now I?m paying my student loans to him by monthly payments and we?re saving up for our wedding (in September next year) and a nice house. 

Now this is where the story is connected. Last Saturday, my mother approached me and told me that since my parents helped me out by letting me stay at home during my undergrad. Now to payback that favor, I have to pay for my brother?s college education. She also said I should pay my sister?s debt when she graduate so that she doesn?t have to pay high interest. I asked her if my brother & sister will pay me back that money when they started working and she got mad at me for being calculating toward my own siblings. She started calling me names and told me that I?m ungrateful, selfish and that she knows I?ve always hate and being jealous of my sister because she is better looking, smarter and people likes her more. I told her that I?m jealous of my sister because she has always been the favorite child not because she is better looking, smarter or people likes her more but I don?t hate her. I also reminded my mother that when I worked part time in undergrad. I sent that money to my sister monthly so that she could have extra money to spend & that I don?t have enough money to pay for my brother?s college tuition & sister?s debt. My mother told me that with my boyfriend & my income we should be able to do that. I told her that is not right because it?s my boyfriend?s money and neither she nor I have the right to tell him what he should do with it. She said that she is not coming to my wedding & will kick me out of the family & all of my relatives will do the same. She called me on Wednesday to come pick up my pictures from the family album and when I got there she was cutting up my baby pictures and telling me my sister is always the favorite child because she is not selfish and she have always listens to my parents. I told her that she verbally abused me in the past because of my acne and the way I walked for years but I?ve always listened and never talked back to her about it then she said it?s because of my ugly personality that I deserve to have those things happened to me and she wished she had suffocate me when I was a baby. I've been crying for the past days and I don't know what to do when my own family won't even come to my wedding. Should I negotiate with my mother about paying half of my brother's tuition?

Hello, Reddit! I apologize it took me a bit to get back to you all, but things have been crazy around here. 


I want to address a few points before I get on with the update: 
I am very sorry if I snapped on anyone who was trying to give me advice. At the time, I was very shocked at the amount of responses that included the word ""abuse"" and categorized my husband's behavior towards myself and our daughter as abusive. Looking back, I see that I was ignorant to it, because I guess it's easier to see when you're not in the midst of it. I just felt very defensive towards anyone insinuating I was purposefully exposing my daughter to a violent environment, but I understand now that people were simply trying to show me the severity of what could be. So thank you, please forgive my unkind words. 


Other people asked me how it was that I possibly brought in any income if I wasn't working and just a college student full time. Like I addressed in the previous post, I served in the Military for almost five years and received a full ride tuition along with some other monetary benefits that set me up very well financially. I apologize if that was confusing for some readers. 


The last point before the update: I will not be addressing our issues with Alex's family. This upset quite a few people, but I just do not feel comfortable doing that. Alex's mother just lost her partner of over forty years and is already suffering medical issues herself. The last thing I want to do is add extra stress to an elderly woman. Alex has been avoiding his mother via telephone as it is, so outside of just letting her know the situation, I don't think her influence would have had any impact. I understand why people feel I should have done that, but it's just a hard limit for me.


**On to the update:** 
Shortly after I posted the OP, I had received TONS of responses, private messages, and comments. Some of them were incredibly helpful, offering me a place to stay, links to helpful websites, etc. Some of them were very harsh and accused me of being a bad mother and wife. But, overall the response was the same: Alex was wrong and grief is not an excuse to be an abusive dickhole. 

I added an edit to the last post, but I'm not sure it was seen by the masses, so I'll give a quick version here. Once Alex returned home from work, I gave him time to unwind and left him to his own devices. When he seemed in a pretty good mood, I asked him to pick an allotted amount of time (no less than ten minutes) and set a timer. He kept pestering me and looked greatly annoyed and wanted to know why, and what I was doing. I just continued to repeat myself until he finally set a timer and chose the minimum time (of course.) So, I pulled out my phone and read the OP almost verbatim (skipped a few things he already knew for the sake of time) and then read as many of the responses I could. I made sure to include one from every perspective, but really honed in on the fact that his behavior was abusive and that he truly needed to see medical help. 

During the course of me reading, he remained quiet and stone faced. When the timer went off, he allowed me to finish the comment I was already half way through and then when I finished he asked me, ""Is that all?"" I emphasized that I truly did love and care about him. That his happiness and overall health was greatly important to me. But, I also let him know that I could not and would not continue to live like this, nor would I allow our daughter to be exposed to this type of behavior. She needs to understand that this is NOT okay and I don't want her to ever feel like I've been feeling these last six months. All he said was ""okay"" and went outside to smoke.

That night, I had a bit of homework so I went upstairs to work on that. When I came back downstairs, he was playing with our daughter, had dinner going, and had cleaned up the house. I thanked him and went to sleep.

The next day was supposed to be his consult for a sleep study. He ended up oversleeping AGAIN, two days in a row, and missed his appointment. From what I've gathered, he was reprimanded at work, and was basically told that if he did it again he would be facing some serious backlash. He was able to get a new appointment for the next day and ended up staying up all night so he wouldn't miss work or the appointment. That whole day he was very quiet, but still helpful. I made no comments and just kind of gave him some space.

He ended up showing up to his appointment (yesterday) at eight in the morning and by ten he still hadn't been seen. I guess at some point, a high ranking doctor noticed that Alex had been there for an unusual amount of the time and ended up being the one to see Alex personally. As it turns out, this doctor was the commander (basically the boss) of all the medical clinics where we are located and has some MAJOR pull. Alex told him of his sleep issues and the commander immediately saw through the BS, and asked him what else had been going on in his life. Alex explained the situation with his dad and for whatever reason, ended up pulling out his phone and showing this man what I had wrote on my previous post. To say that I was shocked was an understatement. This man who had been completely unwilling to change his actions for the last six months, voluntarily showed someone, who could in all honesty ruin his career, what his wife thought of him and his actions.

Apparently, there was a very stern talking to (about the screaming/physical touching) and the commander tore my husband an absolute new one. However, he also decided to help him. Alex is now on an anti-depressant. He is being ordered to get a psychiatric evaluation. He will be undergoing a sleep study (the original reason for this appointment, he's a teeth grinder and breathes weird in his sleep.) And he also will be meeting with this commander personally for the next six months, twice a month to analyze Alex's improvement. The commander suspects that the psychiatric evaluation will result in Alex going to some type of therapy/anger-management. The best part in all of this, is that if Alex does not go, he will get in trouble at work (which he DOES NOT WANT.) He does not have a choice. I guess when this commander was younger, he had a very similar experience, so he sympathizes with Alex. Regardless, this man is an absolute blessing and whatever his motives were, he is saving my husband's life. I am indebted. 


Now, Alex isn't necessarily the happiest camper about all of this, but he's not resistant towards it. He's been on this medication two days now, and I know that SSRIs can take up to two months to take effect, but I think Alex is having a placebo effect because he's already claiming to feel so much better. Last night, he went to sleep at a reasonable hour, and woke up with our daughter without complaint. He took her to the park for the first time in a very long time and also made breakfast. While these may seem minor from the outside, this is the most improvement I have seen in such a long time. It is crazy to me. I don't know how to feel.


Alex and I haven't talked about ""us"" yet, but I'm not going to force it. Right now this isn't about ""us,"" it is about him. Because, if he is not okay, we will not be okay. I cannot change him, I cannot force him to love me or to love himself. I am grateful for these changes, but I'm also feeling slightly resentful that it took someone else to convince him of what I have been saying for six months, but that's petty and I recognize that. 


I will be doing individual therapy in hopes that I can work through what I've gone through for the last six months. I really hope that my husband and I can make this work, but I am not sure if I can ever look at him the same again. Only time will tell and I am braced for whichever way it goes. I am just glad that Alex is getting a second chance, because before all of this he was an amazing person, father, and husband.


Thank you all so much. Without this post and your responses, I truly do not think that my husband would have gotten any better. I attribute your honesty and your genuine care for mine and my daughter's safety towards this happy outcome. You all are wonderful, truly.


TL;DR: My husband is getting professional help. He does not have a choice. Things are looking up.

It's been a rough week. I contacted Lucy's school and informed them that she will be gone for as much time as she needs. I also told them what is going on and Seans name. Lucy and I have talked about it, and she is going to resume school over the summer to catch up with what she is missing. Bottom line is: I don't want her anywhere near my parents or Sean. 

Lucy did want to speak to a priest though, so I contacted the one at her church. He was amazingly helpful and actually drove up here to speak to her. He has offered us resources that she can use to get help through the church, and they spoke a lot about bible passages and stories. She seemed so much lighter after speaking to him, it was amazing. 

He also made a point of saying that he thinks it is extremely healthy for her to stay with me and experience the world outside of such an isolated environment. He didn't judge my parents outright, but he did say that sometimes people have trouble seeing the real issue in a situation like this.

I called my parents. They aren't going to listen to anything I have to say, and Lucy is refusing to speak to them. I ended up telling them that if they didn't want legal action taken against them for child endangerment then they will let her live with me until the end of school. They seemed to agree, but only because the alternative isn't something they want their friends and church to hear about. 

My boyfriend and I have been house hunting this week and we should have a new home with a bedroom for Lucy by the end of this month, but for now she is sleeping in my room. 

As for her mental health, she isn't at all the person I remember. The light has gone out in her, and nothing can make her in a better mood. She has been sitting in front of the TV for the last few days. I was able to get her out of the house on Friday to go shopping (she needed clothes, toiletries and other stuff one needs), but she had a really hard time with it. She can't speak to any men, which I completely respect and I would never make her do anything she is uncomfortable with. She seems to be okay with my boyfriend though, and he has actually gotten her to laugh a few times.

I have also gotten her a pre paid cell phone due to the comments I got in my original post. I have given her all of the numbers for rape hotlines and RAINN, and she has been calling them when I'm not there. She doesn't want me to know what she is talking about with them, so I am letting her do her thing. 

This is going to be a long road to recovery, but I am happy to say that for the first time I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. People have been so amazing and helpful, and Lucy has realized that this is not the end of her world. She is determined to get back to as close of a normal life as she can, and I will be there every step of the way. 
   
**tl;dr**: Parents have backed off for the most part because I have threatened them with legal action. Lucy has been in contact with her priest, and has been speaking to hotlines to get help. We are okay for the time being, and trying to move past this as best we can. ",1430792207.0,[UPDATE] My [24F] half sister [14F] was raped. My mom [53F] and her dad [46M] refuse to believe her.,0.92

Hello there,

I wanted to give an update to the situation and also thank everyone for their comments and support. I took the time to read through almost all the comments and posts, but I was unable to respond to many of them because of everything that was happening. The funeral was yesterday and the days before that was spent with family. There was also a viewing on Sunday and that lasted the entire day.

When my BF came down on Friday, we talked some more about the situation and what was happening. It definitely was much easier to discuss everything in person as opposed to a phone call. After we talked about it, he was much more understanding about the situation. He told me that he was willing to come with me to the viewing on Sunday with me to support me. 

By this time, I had also cooled down a bit and thought about everything. By reading all the replies, I was able to understand that even though he wanted to support me through my time of need, it's not always clear cut as I thought it would be. He has anxiety when it comes to large crowds of people and he also did not know if my family knew of my situation of being gay. He felt very uncomfortable and pressured into a situation without any time to prepare. 

In the beginning, I failed to understand why those concerns would supersede my needs for support. But after cooling down a bit, I understood it more from his point of view. We were able to come to a compromise about it where he came with me to the viewing but not the funeral. While he was with me over the weekend, he was very sweet and caring and it helped me immensely.

All in all, it was a great learning experience and we both definitely learned about each other more. I think it made us closer and we are better for it.

I wanted to say thanks again to everyone who commented and provided advice and different perspectives. It made me extremely emotional (in a good way!) knowing that there were so many people willing to help. Thank you very much!

The wedding was Saturday, and I  thought you would all like to hear how things worked out.

Following everyone's suggestions from the first update, I contacted all the vendors, etc and told them not to take any input from anyone not me or my sister.  Including the pastor, who my sister has admitted befriending and coming to for advice.  He was surpisingly awesome and I ended up telling him the whole story, and got upset about things as well.

A few days later, I get a call from the DJ, who says that someone else called to question some stuff about the reception, namely the timing, which I knew was a sticking point for Janet.  Later talking to the venue, they said someone talked to them.  In both instances, they gave the answer that all that should be directed to me.  Meanwhile, I've been watching Janet's facebook, and found rather passive aggressive posts that seemed to be pointed towards my sister and I.  I ignored them, my sister maintained no contact.

A week before the wedding, I get a text from Janet, asking ""What should I do with Christopher.  We have two hours where I'll be busy with pictures he will be alone"".  Now, I didn't know she had a child, and didn't think my sister had arranged any child care, so this seemed totally a pertinent question.  Without thinking, I replied that I was sure there were some cousins who would be happy to babysit, and that it would be wise to pack a bag of stuff if he was too young to entertain himself for 2 hours.

Then I messaged my sister.  Christopher is Janet's boyfriend.  It was an honest mistake, but kind of hilarious.  Janet didn't message me back.

Before the rehearsal, I made sure Janet had the full schedule for the weekend.  I sent it through text, email and facebook message.  She responded maybe twice on the group message I sent.  The day before the rehearsal, I sent her several texts reminding her to be at the church at 5.

Of course, she wasn't there.  Everyone starts talking about it, and I guessed at this point word had gotten around that Janet was being a pain, and the general consensus was disgust and relief. The pastor and I talked, and he pulled my sister aside and said they would make plans if Janet just wasn't there.  It wasn't really a big adjustment.  One groomsman would instead escort in the groom's grandmother.  

We do a run through, the pastor calls for us to do another quick run through of walking and seating.  And the doors open and there is Janet.  I think she thought she was making an entrance.  Instead, everyone--grandparents and parents and bridal party are all shooting her the dirtiest of looks.  The pastor, to his credit, put on his best, dripping with disdain, Professor Snape voice and said ""You must be Janet.  We thought you weren't coming"" and waved for her to get in line.  She seemed cowed, and stayed very quiet.

Afterwards, she tried to rather loudly claim that she had no clue what time things were.  This was quickly disproven thanks to the texts I had saved.  She is, at this point, just hanging all over my sister, sort of sniveling.  

We were meeting at a restaurant nearby for the rehearsal dinner.  It literally was within walking distance, and most of us just wandered over.  Somehow, Janet drove and managed to be late to the dinner, claiming to be lost.  She ended up sitting by the groom's family.  For the start of the dinner, she sat arms crossed, like a petulant child.  Then she started drinking--way too much.  Thankfully, she was far enough away that my sister and her husband didn't really notice her antics.

As we left, I think every single person there reminded her to be at the hotel to get ready by 10, especially my brother.  She kept nodding and uh huhing.  I sent a few texts and facebook messages for good measure.

Of course the next day--no show.  We had a hair dresser set up in the suite, and she did all our updos, then hung around for a while before packing up.  This is about when Janet finally arrived.  I think my sister by this point was so done with Janet's shit she didn't even get upset.

Now, to get this next part, you have to understand I have long hair that I always wear in a tight French braid, then curled into a bun.  Most people never see my hair down.  For the wedding, my sister wanted these pinterest discovered, loose braided hair down styles.  When she had said braids though, Janet had complained that we would all look like ""dykes"" like me.

So, I answer the door with a rather nice hairstyle down over my shoulders, makeup done professionally, dress on.  Janet literally has her hair wet, no makeup, and her dress in a bag.  When she found out the hair stylist and makeup person was gone, she flipped.  I recommended that I could just braid my hair like I wear mine everyday, and she just shot me dirty dirty looks.  Instead, Janet ended up having a half hour to basically dry her hair and pull it in a ponytail.

The next little thing was totally passive aggressive on my part.  When my sister and I had our heart to heart, my sister admitted that Janet sold jewelry through some pyramid scheme.  She had strong armed my sister into buying a jewelry set, which she didn't terribly care for.  I told her that I would take care of it.

I went through a connection and ended up renting a vintage set of jewelry, pieces far nicer than anything I could afford.  On the day of the wedding, they brought it to the hotel, and it brought my sister to tears.  When Janet showed up at the hotel, there stood my sister glittering in diamonds instead of the plastic pieces she coaxed her into.

I knew too this entered a temptation for Janet's power play.  So, I also contacted a guy who works at a friend's nightclub as security.  The guy is quite professional, and looks like he could be a male model.  I paid him to walk around, supposedly to be security for the necklace.  Really though, he was there in case Janet pulled anything, and to keep my sister a bit more stress free.  Also, he ended up making my sister feel like a rockstar, needing security.

All that was left was for Janet to behave like a petulant child.  Which she did, in spades, pouting and making photos difficult.  I asked the photographer to place her end of the row, in case my sister decides to have her edited out.  That's my sister's choice, but it's prepared if she so chooses.

My security let me know Janet left right after dinner at the reception.  None of us noticed.

My sister lifted the blocks for Janet online on the flight for her honeymoon.  She hasn't made any contact since, or made any acknowledgement of the wedding or honeymoon pictures.

When my sister gets back, I'll talk to her about their friendship more.  Thank you everyone for your excellent suggestions and thoughts.  They helped me to make my decisions, and everything seems to have worked out.

673,Throwaway_8174,Relationships,3vwq6m,1921,"My girlfriend is usually a wonderful person, but she has been getting more aggressive and physically violent over the past few months. Today, I was at my office (we are both PhD students at the same university). She came over to my desk and we talked a while, but I could tell she was getting increasingly agitated for some reason. She suddenly snapped, whispered that I should know she's stressed and make her feel better before walking right up to me (I was sitting down at my computer) pinching my neck (it bled) and leaving. I was shocked but let it slide.

Two hours later I went home (we flat together). She was sitting in the lounge browsing Facebook, and I asked her into our room for a sec, as our two flatmates were also chilling out in the lounge. I told her I understand she is upset, love her very much, and that I was hurt by what she did and asked her why she hurt me.

She suddenly exploded, tore up my right arm with her nails (there is a fair bit of blood), and stormed out of the room. I was shocked, and just sat there staring at my arm for what could have been either 5 minutes or half an hour. Suddenly, she burst back in and demanded I read this letter she wrote. I was still rather shocked, so she had to ask 3 times before I responded and I told her that if I abused her up there is no way I could demand she read some stupid letter. I asked her to communicate like grownups. She exploded again, ripped my hair, punched me, kicked me and demanded I read the letter. I was trying to be quiet as the other flatmates were home and  I felt super embarrassed by all this, so I read her letter. It was on her PC. When I finished, she quizzed me on it and then went off her nut when she figured out I had not scrolled down to the last part (I did not notice a scroll bar. I was hurting a lot and crying, and frankly fucking scared of any future blows coming my way).

At this stage she proceeded to beat the living shit out of me as I took cover next to my desk trying to cover my face with my arms. She told me I was being a pussy, a weakling, not worth her time, not acting like a man, etc etc. I never hit back. She demanded I leave, but not out the door as the flatmates would see me crying, so I got out of the window and walked 40 minutes to my office at the University (keys to car were in the room).

I'm in shock. I have just recently signed a new lease with this girl until end 2016. What the fuck made her explode like this? Is there an acceptable explanation for this? What the hell do I do? I don't want to go home.
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend beat me, I ran away and am at University. I am scared.

EDIT: Thanks for the advice. I have a friend driving over to come pick me up (it started raining in the last 30 min so I don't want to walk anywhere). I haven't told him why I need him yet but he's already on his way. I'll explain when he gets here in ~20 min. I'm going to find the office camera and take some photos on an SD Card for if I need them later.

EDIT2: Friend just pulled into the parking lot. Thanks for all the advice, it really means a lot. I will check back here some time tomorrow to remind myself of the stuff I need to do in the next few days.

EDIT3: Hey all, I never expected as large a response as this got, and wanted to thank you all for the advice, kind words and sharing your own experiences.

674,TheBlueMenace,[new],awae0c,1922,"In this group of around 14 friends, there is 6 women (including myself) all around 32 years old, the most (including myself) of which attended high school together but expanded over University etc (so we have all known each other for at least 10 plus years). One recently had a wedding, and I was not invited. I knew a few of the others had attended. I was fine with that (she had wanted to have a small event), and I got her a card and some cash to give to her when I next saw her. 

The next chance I saw her was a Christmas party. So I took the card and my KrisKringle (KK) present. I spoke to her and everything seemed friendly, and congratulated her briefly on her wedding. I didn't mention the card I had, as I figured I would give it to her when KK was happening. 

As everyone sat down to start KK, she spoke up. She had gifts to give to the women in her wedding party as thanks. Which turned out to be every other woman in the friend group except me. I didn't say anything, and smiled and joked around with everyone else, but I was hurt by her actions. I had thought we were friends, and not being invited to a wedding in which every single mutual female friend not only attended but were part of the wedding party really made me question if she even likes me at all. 

I did not give her the card. Over the next 2-3 weeks I spent the cash I was going to give her as congratulations. This weekend the friends are all meeting up again. I could give her the cashless card, but I honest don't want to. I've tried to not let her actions make me bitter, but I haven't really spoken to her since then (but also haven't really been forced into a situation were I would have normally either). If I avoid her this weekend it will be very obvious, and this is really affecting how I see the group and myself, as none of the other women (or men) spoke to me about it either. Am I wrong to not congratulate her properly on her wedding in spite? How can I know if it was something about me that was the problem? How do I resolve this without causing drama between everyone?

**TLDR**; Bride doesn't invite me to a wedding which had all mutual female friends in wedding party and now I am bitter and unsure about entire friendship group. 

**Update**: Thanks everyone! I've decided to ask her directly why she didn't invite me to the wedding either before or after the met up this weekend. She may have a reason why, and if so, I can let giving the gifts in front of everyone go, as I don't feel it was malicious as some suggested. 

**Update2**: After all that, The Bride didn't make it to the meet up. However, I did get one of the other women alone, and since I had been thinking about this so much, decided to ask some indirect questions. I asked after the wedding, where it was, what they ate, everyone have fun... *who was there*. The women said this: ""Oh, they only had 30 people, including the bridal party. The Bride just had her siblings and parents, and the groom his. The only non-family were in the bridal party, which is why she had 4 bridesmaids."" So that is it then, she really just had to make a cut somewhere. I guess I'm just going to let it go, even if I still feel a little slighted by being the odd one out. If I'm still thinking on it the next time I see the Bride it might be different, but knowing how really small the whole thing was does make me feel better.

675,licewife,Non-Romantic,42lbdj,1919,"Hi, this is embarrasing. 

We've been together for 4 years, have a couple of kids, and are doing fine, just fyi.

My wife went for a haircut like 8 months ago and was embarrased to find out she had lice and they wouldn't cut her hair. We assumed she got it from a friend's daughter who we hadn't seen in months since she had lice and would stay over often and even gave it to our son. We used those lice combs and treatments a few times but my wife has very long and fine hair so we missed some and accomplished virtually nothing. 

Now I'm not upset because we've been unsuccessful. I'm upset because in the last six months, my wife has not attempted any treatment at all. She has been completely ignoring the problem and gets annoyed at me when I bring it up. She /always/ has an excuse ready for why she can't do anything about it at the moment and has probably set at least a dozen dates where she says she'll set time aside to handle it but something always comes up or she just forgets. Last week, she called a service that treats lice but didn't get a call back and never followed up. Now she says she'll call again next week because she doesn't have any money.

I don't want to lose my family over such a seemingly stupid issue but I really just never saw myself married to someone who lacks the resolve to get rid of a bug infestation in their own hair. It's disgusting, it is a turn-off, it's selfish (she'll give it to me or my kids eventually), and it is indicative of a much larger character flaw that I can't quite put my finger on. 

Even aside from all of that, the everyday nuissance of having bugs in her hair is very irritating. We can't spoon, she can't get a haircut even though she desperately needs one, she'll put her head on mine without thinking during sex and it will completely ruin the mood for me, etc.

The worst thing is that she's super insecure about it and also acts like nothing is really wrong since she's getting it taken care of soon. But she's been acting like this for over 6 months and still treats me like I'm being an ass if I bring it up. She reacts like I'm making a jab at her looks or her weight. I'm extremely confident at this point that if I were to just ignore the issue and let her handle it in her own time (like I was doing for months) that this might possibly never be resolved.

Unless people here convince me it's a stupid idea, I'm probably going to show her this. I've tried talking to her about it but it doesn't accomplish anything and she just immediately gets irritated and changes the subject.

**EDIT: There is a lot of misinformation about lice here. Keep these facts in mind before adding to the problem:** 

**Lice only survive off of the host for like a day.** 

**Lice can't jump or fly.**

**Lice don't carry diseases.**

**Pets can't get lice.**

**I 100% do not have lice and neither do my kids so please stop telling me we do.**

Last month or two she's been exhibiting some textbook behavior that would lead me to suspect she's cheating. I see her significantly less than normal, which she told me was due to her job. Out of paranoia I asked her coworker on Facebook about this. She told me they'd been working normal hours, nothing's changed, and that my girlfriend's attendance has actually been bad. 

Talked to her roomie/best friend of many years and she said that she has not spoken to her as much recently either and is hardly home but she thought she was with me. 

Not only that but any time I am with my girlfriend recently she'd been very protective of her phone and seemed uninterested in being around me, and very easily irritated. This isn't really like her, if anything I was always the one more easily irritated in the relationship.

She briefly mentioned someone she'd gotten back in contact with that used to be a friend in high school, so I decided to message this girl on Facebook asking if she's heard from her a lot recently or what. This girl didn't respond. 

It was really fishy so this lead me to look at her phone the next time we hung out when she was asleep. I'm not proud of it, but every time I brought anything up she was really defensive. 

I looked in her phone and there were no texts suggesting she was cheating. But instead, a lot of texts with aforementioned high school friend about popping pills together, all the new drugs she wanted to try and do, when she could get her hands on more. What hurt the most was seeing ""I don't want to talk to anyone I just want to get high"" in context of this girl asking about if I, or her roomie, knows about what she's been up to.

I don't know what to do. The only person she is talking to right now is the girl who provides her these drugs and does them with her.

I was 99.9% sure she was cheating so I only have been thinking about what I'd do given I found out she was. With this...I don't know. I want to help her, so badly. But I still feel so many things. Confusion, why would she even turn to drugs? She didn't seem unhappy. But a little betrayed that she would act like this to me. And most of all, really concerned. I love her so much and don't want to see her go down this path, a path that could really fucking harm her.

Thanks again to everyone who commented and encouraged me to talk to Darby.


So...  I talked to her.  I thought for a while that I wouldn't because I was afraid of the confrontation, but after a series of nightmares involving DJ and THEN getting my bike stolen from my home, I thought that I was ready to feel just a little safer in my day-to-day life.


I sat her down this morning and said, ""Hey, can we talk?""  I planned it so that I would have to leave the house right after our discussion (I wanted to give her time to think if she needed it).  She said no problem, and we sat down in the living room.


I decided to give her a really, really broad overview of the situation and then ask her, ""Do you need more details?"" until she felt satisfied with what I had told her.  First I said, ""It's about DJ.  I don't mind him coming around the house, I don't mind him staying the night here.  However, I don't feel comfortable being alone with him and I don't want to spend any time with him at dinner/catching up...  alone or otherwise.  All I ask is that you warn me before he visits, so I can make my own accommodations.  Do you want to know anymore, or are you good?""


She had a really disgusted look on her face, and said, ""Did he do something terrible to you?""  I paused for a while, and she said, ""Yeah, tell me more.""


I said, ""He hasn't done anything absolutely horrible* yet, but when I'm alone with him and we are both drunk, he has tried to get physical with me.  I decline, and he gets increasingly persistent.  This has happened upwards of 5 times.""


*I know this was pretty much a lie, but I could tell she was on board and I just didn't want to make her more disgusted than she needed to be unless she requested more info.


She looked disgusted again, and after thinking for a moment she said, ""I know.  I am not alone with him, I don't see him do anything, but I've had a sense my whole life that he was a slimeball with women.  He's always sought after women who he can take advantage of in one way or another.  I've tried to shame him for these things, but I can't really do anything if he doesn't listen to me.  I'm glad you told me, and I'm sorry that this happened.  I expect that I'll see him at Christmas and Thanksgiving, but past that, don't worry about him being around because he won't be.""


I thanked her a lot, and told her how nervous I was to bring it all up, and she said,  ""Hey I'm a rational person, you know that.  I believe you, and I wasn't going to be in denial about this sort of thing just because he's my brother.""


She then told me to go do whatever I needed to do for the day, and said when I came home she was going to have cupcakes waiting for me.  She's really a great roommate, and although this whole situation wasn't ideal, I think it's all ended in the best possible way for all of us.
   

**tl;dr**: Told the roommate, she believed me and told me that he wasn't going to be coming around anymore.  Also cupcakes.


Edit:  Thank you so much for the gold, and thanks for every person who is telling me such positive things.  I felt so scared and nervous before all of this, but after talking to Darby and getting such an overwhelmingly positive response and now posting here and getting so much encouragement, I don't feel so alone, you know?  I really feel like if anything like this happens again I'll know what to do and I'll know that I have a support system to lean on (my friends who I asked for advice, my roommate, my boyfriend, my sister).  I can't express what a confidence boost this was.  I finally feel like I'm getting back to my old, not terrified, self.

Yesterday I had an appointment with the design center for our new house that we had just bought. His family was in town so most of the week has been spending time with them. Relatively he hadn't been acting strange. 

The appointment went well. 

When we got home he asked if I wanted to ""have that talk"" now. My heart fell into my stomach. 

We walked to a nearby park and were quiet on the walk over. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to ask him a question or something so I stayed quiet. 

Stood on the dock and we(mostly I) were distracted by a couple of dolphins swimming past. You can almost always see a few in the early and late parts of the day. 

I turn my head and he hands me an envelope. It is a hand made envelope that he'd drawn my name on. 

I was a little shaky because I was nervous already about anticipating the worst. I got to the end of the letter in tears look up and he dropped to one knee and (holy fucking shit) proposed to me. 

I couldn't even talk. I had the letter covering most of my face because I was suddenly a oozing factory of tears and sniffles. 

The part of this you need to understand is what exactly he'd done. 

I'm into dark, vintage, and antique 'odd' things. He hand made a letter to look old and vintage. He remembered my favorite pattern was damask for the interior and outside of the letter. 

And he got me a *teeeny tiny itty bitty* bat skull from somewhere online that he'd had in a small wooden coffin box with the ring. (None of you may find this interesting, but it absolutely melted my heart) the ring is gorgeous. He remembered (I think I told him years ago) that I don't like giant rings with giant diamonds and didn't really like diamonds. 

He instead got me a white gold ring with a black onyx stone and it has two *TINY* diamonds in the sides. I love it. 

He apologized for all the weirdness over and over and he was just stressing out about asking, and his family, and the house. 

Pictures! (In case anyone thought I was kidding) *Edit: Sorry! Didn't know about the external links. Can post them in a separate part of Reddit any whoever wants to stalk my profile or whatever can look at them*

I feel kind of like a jerk. I never could get behind the cheating train and I knew he didn't do drugs so I was still lost in what it could have been. A few of you even suggested he was proposing and I brushed that off even. I'm still in she'll shock and don't even know what to do with myself

Happy ending. Thank you all for your advice!

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54tq2d/i_23f_really_like_a_coworker_23m_but_cant_tell_if/

Original post above! Tl;dr my cute coworker and me, wasn't sure if he liked me and if it was appropriate to ask him.

So over time I still liked him but had moved out of the intense crush phase. It didn't seem like he was interested. It made me a little sad, but wasn't devastating or anything. Still would have been over the moon if he had just spontaneously asked me out, but it wasn't as much on my mind anymore.

So we were hanging out and talking about another coworker/friend, who just started officially dating a guy she had been casually seeing. (Not trash talk, just like ""wonder how it's going!"") I had already told him about my past relationship, and he had alluded to dating people in the past but very much in passing and with an air of not wanting to elaborate, so I hadn't asked. But we are fairly close friends now, so I figured I'd ask him directly since I felt sure he would just tell me if he didn't want to talk about it.

To my surprise, he's actually dating a ""friend"" from college he's told me about in the past (i actually met him once at a lecture we went to after work)! The only reason I say I'm surprised was that for some reason I thought my coworker had said that this friend had a girlfriend. But it turned out I had just gotten confused about which friend he was talking about. But the second he said it, everything made much more sense. He and the friend (actually boyfriend!) went to lunch every now and then during the workday since we all work near each other...I thought it was sweet that they had such a tight friendship but it's even cuter now that I know they just have a really close relationship!

I'll admit there was a part of me that was a tiny bit sad when he first told me, but I'm being totally honest when I say that that only lasted for a moment. I'm queer as well, so we had a really good heart to heart (he had pinged my ""gaydar"" as being queer, but wasn't sure if he was bi or whatnot), and honestly I feel like we're closer now than ever now, but with none of those butterflies in my stomach from earlier, just really honest friendship.

Also, we have another gay coworker and friend who is very flamboyant and we are planning on trolling him by telling him he no longer has the gayest study in this lab (we're scientists). His face will be amazing.


Tl;dr he's gay and in a really cute relationship, and we are bros

Also, I truly did not expect this level of response! My original post had a couple of comments, but I wanted to share this anyway, since it's interesting that this is one of those times when I had a sudden paradigm shift, and also an example of a situation not ending in a ""good"" way (ie, oh he likes me and we're dating!), but in a way that's actually somehow better (great bonding moment with a friend).

680,tiredandsickthrowawa,Non-Romantic,61smf5,1913,"My boyfriend James and his best friend Carl are like brothers. They lived next door to each other as kids, went to the same university, and have been roommates since university. I've been with James for 2 years now, and we just moved in together in January. We found a place just down the street from their old apartment, and James jokes that the only reason we chose our current place is so he could stay close to his soulmate (Carl).

Carl and I didn't click immediately, but after James mentioned that he wished we were better friends, we tried to find something we had in common to bond over. We discovered that we have similar music tastes, so we started going to concerts together. When Carl invites James and I to an event and James doesn't want to go, he'll insist that Carl and I go have fun without him, which we do. Carl and I will never be super tight bffs, but I treasure his friendship and it's great that we finally have some common ground.

According to our friend group (and the posts I've lurked on /r/relationships), this is weird. James and I have received backhanded comments about how I shouldn't be spending so much time alone with another man, and how much fun Carl and I must have without James there. Once Carl and I went to the symphony (which James hates), and we had our photo taken by some nightlife company and had our picture posted on their Facebook page. We were standing several feet apart in the photo and clearly talking with other people, but a mutual friend screenshotted this and sent it to James with a very rude comment, and James immediately unfriended her.

These comments make me mad because 1) they imply that the only reason Carl and I hang out is to fuck behind James' back, not like we're actually friends with shared interests, and 2) there's the implication that I am not allowed to do anything without James there, and that doing otherwise is disrespecting my relationship. James usually laughs these comments off and dismisses them, while I just don't know what to say.

What I would like to know is how to handle these sorts of comments when they come up - I don't think Carl and I are doing anything wrong. James and I are always invited together, and he has stated many times he's happy that Carl and I have become good friends. What should I do?

In the grand scheme of auto immune conditions it?s on the low end. It?s completely non-contagious and I am in the process of working with my immunologist to treat the condition via a combination of steroids and immunosuppressants. It?s not going to kill me or lower my life expectancy, it?s just a chronic thing that will flare up throughout my life. 


SO and I have been together for almost 2 years now, and up until my diagnosis it has been smooth sailing. When I got the diagnosis, my boyfriend completely freaked out and now thinks that because I have an autoimmune condition, I must be HIV positive. In the last week, I have started a huge dose of immunosuppresents to get the condition under control. Of course this means it has wreaked havoc on my immune system ? something my family dr, the immunologist and pharmacist have advised me on ? and I am more susceptible to certain illnesses.. Last week I developed a pretty nasty flu and had an outbreak of cold sores. SO was livid, and thinks that is a sign of HIV. He started yelling at me, accused me of cheating on him and left our home to stay with his family. 


I don?t have HIV. I have had multiple blood work and tests in the past couple of months. I?ve offered for SO to come with me to speak to my doctor. He is insisting that I must have HIV, and he is not coming home until I admit that I lied/cheated on him.

682,allfamilyallthetime,Non-Romantic,452yxt,1913,"My fiance and I have been saving up for six months for a getaway together a month from now, a much-needed romantic adventure for the two of us. We had mentioned it to his parents a while back and they recommended a cabin resort they've been going to for years, and we decided to go there.  We will be passing through his parents' city to get there, so he let his mom know we could have lunch before or after. They chatted about the details and so on and then made lunch plans.  Great!

Then on Sunday night his aunt (his mom's sister) FB messaged me asking if this place has a pool because she wasn't sure if she needs a new swimming suit.  I sent back some question marks, thinking there was just some confusion.

It turns out fiance's mom thought about our trip over the weekend and realized it would make a great family getaway!  She called her parents, her brother/SIL and her sister/BIL to make sure they and all their kids were free and could come.

She called my fiance (apparently to tell him all this) after she talked to the rest of the family on Sunday night, but we missed the call and when we called back they had gone to bed.

Apparently on her lunch break yesterday (Monday) she called the family who owns the cabins and asked if we could cancel our reservation because she wanted to rent a way bigger place for everyone.  They have been going to this place for years and know the owners really well, so the owners assumed everything was cool and are willing to help us however they can, hooray.  They called me asking if I wanted a refund to my card or if if I wanted to apply the money from our reservation to her new reservation.  

I had my fiance call her as soon as he got off work last night and then it all came out.  She basically said ""well you would have known already if you answered the phone Sunday night!""  

He told her this was supposed to be a romantic getaway for us and she again said we should have answered on Sunday night and it's too late now because she paid for the bigger cabin already.  In fact since it's less than a month away, everyone who needed time off work put in for time off yesterday, Monday.  So she feels it's too late.

After talking to her last night my fiance talked to her again late night and now again this morning.  He has offered to go for a big family trip some other time, saying several times that we want to keep our original plans, but she just keeps saying it's too late, but it's going to be a great time.  When he pushed it she accused him of not caring about family, of caring about me more than his family, of not caring about the fact that his grandma is getting very old and probably can't do these things much longer so we should do it while we can, and so on.  She is definitely laying on the guilt trip and it's working.

When he brought up that she did not ask us or talk to us about it before making all these plans she guilted him some more, pretty much ""I didn't know I needed to ask, I thought you cared about family and loved family, and would be HAPPY to spend time with family.."" and that some people would kill for a family trip like this.

We don't know what to do anymore.  We talked about just giving in and planning a new trip for ourselves another time, but we don't want to send a message that it's okay to walk all over us/our plans. On the other hand we can just keep our reservation and do our own thing, but that will probably come with more guilt trips.

I don't know what to do anymore, and my fiance is stressed to the max from dealing with all this already.

TL;DR is husband was in therapy for his issues and making progress but I was having a hard time having patience and being supportive.

It has been a few months since my post and I wanted to update, mostly because there were several people who related and I thought an update might be helpful.

Things are better now, but they definitely got even harder before they got better. My husband ended up having to do an intensive outpatient program for suicidal ideation. However since then he's continually improved.

I have worked hard on distancing myself from his issues and remembering that I cannot change, control, or fix his emotions or mood. However, this whole period of time was even harder on me than I realized. I dealt with a fair amount of neglect as a child, and I did not even cognitively realize it but all of this (plus family and work/life balance issues happening concurrently) made me feel like I was all alone again and put me in a very bad place. I got very depressed and nearly killed myself. Fortunately, my therapist and psychiatrist are both amazing and we got my meds right and I am feeling much better.

Currently, my husband is managing his remaining anxiety issues well. I am maintaining a healthy boundary about how much I can help him, working on accepting my family situation, and learning how to have a healthy work-life balance (I own my own business - it's hard). Most importantly, as one commenter said would happen, my trust is slowly building back up. It feels like we are ""us"" again and it's so nice. We have always had so much fun together and I really missed that. Last night we were making up songs and dancing like idiots in our kitchen and I felt so grateful in that moment that we made it out of the other side of this.

Now onto the update:

After I made the [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pti4v/my_23f_so_22m_of_6_months_is_mad_because_ive/) everything was calm for a while. I've told him that I feel disrespected when he leaves everything lying around without cleaning it and also told him that I feel the same when he just eats all of my food without buying new stuff. He said he understood, apologized for overreacting and everything was fine! 

We had a small falling out because he threw a small chunk of meat on my rug by accident (it's one of those shaggy ones where you end up searching for stuff for hours) and I told him to pick it up immediately for the above mentioned reason and he refused to. He apologized and picked it up after he finished his meal. 

He also talked with me about his feelings and told me that he fears he might be depressed. We had a long talk about it and how he's always feeling exhausted, I suggested maybe just picking up running again because he absolutely loved it before. He did! It apparently even helped for a little while, but after 1 1/2 weeks he stopped doing that, too. 

We also talked about our vacation and he said he just couldn't afford it. He did go out with his friends a lot more, though. 

Which is kind of the reason I'm writing this right now, he never introduced me to his friends in our city. I have met every single friend of his in his hometown. 

I've met two of his friends in our city once, but that's it. The first time I've asked to get to know them or meet them was back in February, he always claimed they were busy and if they did go out somewhere it was ""just the people from our study group, sorry!"". I've listened to this for the past 4ish months. There is also a very attractive girl in his study group.

When I asked him if he wanted to go out today, he said he'd think about it. We haven't seen each other a lot lately since he's always studying or grabbing a beer with his study group. He promised me a few weeks ago that he didn't have to study as much anymore and that we'd have more time to go out and enjoy our time together. Hasn't happened yet. 

Twenty minutes later, while I was leaving to go grocery shopping, he said that he already had plans with his study group. He said that he waited to tell me until I had to leave because he ""didn't want me to annoy him"".

When I asked him who was going, he said ""John and the others"". I asked who ""the others"" were, turns out the attractive girl is joining them. I asked if I could join, since he's been promising me I'd get to meet them for the past 4 months. He said that I'm always asking (first time today) and that he doesn't want me to meet them today and besides, why do I always have to annoy him with my questions? 

I've calmly told him that I have never asked before if he could ask his group whether or not I could join and I'm just curious since he's spending a lot of time with them (up to 30 hours for studying, the occasional beer afterwards) and he's been promising for the fucking past 4 months. I've also told him that I wanted to get to know them because he apparently liked them, he refers to them as his friends even though he never truly talks about some of them in great detail. I bet you all can guess which one he doesn't talk about. 

A lot more stuff was said, but in the end we broke up because I said I wanted to know why he didn't want me to meet his friends and he couldn't come up with a good reason apart from ""Why do you need to?"". What the fuck?

Thank you guys for all your help. It's just been an hour since we broke up and I fear this post is a mess. I've already been doubting my decision to break up, which is why I came back and read all of your comments on the original post.

My father (adoptive, too, but he's MY FATHER so I'll be calling him that) and I were never very close emotionally, but I don't believe he's ever been close with anyone in his life, not even my mother. He's just not open to that. We don't hug, we don't say ""I love you,"" or anything like that. 

What we do do, however, is support each other. It's clear that we care for each other's problems and achievements. I rely on him like any young person would rely on their parent. 

The problem is that, beginning at about age 18, whenever we would happen to go to, say, the mall together to look for a gift for my mother, we would get stares and comments. It wasn't such a big deal because USUALLY when we went out, my mother came with us, so it didn't happen. Plus I was young and thought it was cool that people would assume that I was adult enough for that. 

Now that my mom's gone, I feel this is really damaging our relationship. When he used to take me out to dinner when he'd come visit me at University, we used to get stares and some ""golddigger"" comments which, while not said directly to us, were clearly meant to be overheard by us. It got to the point where he started inviting my roommate out to dinner with us, too. That wasn't a problem with either of us, but it was sad.

Now that I'm a college graduate, it seems things have gotten worse. I asked him to come with me to shop for my first adult apartment, as he knows way more about leases and structural integrity, damages, what to look for, etc, than I ever could be expected to with no experience. After we finished looking at the first place, they asked us how long we'd been dating. That was awkward. The first time. After the third (private) apartment we viewed told us that they couldn't condone us living there together, we called it quits.

How do I deal with this? My father's clearly suffering more from this than I am. It makes him incredibly uncomfortable to be alone with me in public and that hurts me. Please help.

Anyway...on to the update. It's got some good, and it's got some bad. Most importantly, though, is that I did indeed break up with my girlfriend.

A few days after posting, I tried calling her, with the intention of asking her to meet up so I could break up with her in person, but she never answered the phone, or it would ring a couple times and go straight to voicemail. After a few days of this, I finally just...I finally just stopped giving a fuck. I just broke up with her over text. This might get me some flack, but as far as I'm concerned, she lost her privilege to a face-to-face break up conversation after ignoring me for four days straight. 

I texted something like, ""Look, I wanted to do this in person, but you won't return my calls. I'm breaking up with you. This relationship isn't working, and I'm not sure it ever really did. Please don't post about this on Fetlife, in vague terms or otherwise. Take care of yourself.""

I never got a response back. And to my genuine surprise, she listened to me about not talking about it social media. Besides a few VERY vague status updates (""Ugh, such an awful day today... :("" and other similar bullshit), not a peep.

I contacted some friends that night (many of whom are mutual friends with my ex), saying, ""Just broke up with Girlfriend. Can we go out and get some drinks or something?"" And nearly all my friends responded with yes. We all went out to a bar that night and had a...well, we had a time. I ranted a lot about my relationship with my ex. I even told them I had to break up with her over text, and although some of my friends were shocked, after I explained why, they understood. A few of them told me that they noticed that my relationship seemed really one-sided, and one of my closest friends admitted that she always wanted to bring that up with me, but didn't know how. There was also some discussion about the ""apology"" post on Fetlife, and again, everyone was like, ""The fuck was that all about? Is she 12?!"" So...my fears that my friends would take her side were completely unfounded. :)

Still...it's not a break up without some drama, right? Sigh.

A friend was moving to another city, and about a week ago, he threw a going-away party at his house before he left. I knew my ex was going to be there, and this would be the first time we would see each other since we broke up. Well, since before we broke up, since I didn't get to do that in person...

I was really nervous, and honestly considered not going to the party, but I knew this was going to be the last time I would see my friend for a while. So maybe this was a bit petty, but I got my hair, nails and make up done, and put on the sexiest dress I own, just so my ex could get a look at all the good shit she was missing out on.

When I got to the party, it was a pretty emotional moment when I saw her. She was looking beautiful, as always. We exchanged an awkward hello, and then I peaced the hell out to the other side of my friend's house.

I managed to avoid her for most of the night, and had a really good time. But as the night got later and later, and more and more people were leaving the party, it soon was just me, my ex, our friend who was moving away, and a handful of other people.

We were all hanging out in the living room, and all things considered, we were actually having a good time. My ex and I even had a couple small conversations that weren't too terribly awkward or weird.

But at around 2AM, my friend and the two or three other people went outside to have a smoke, and it was just me and my girlfriend sitting alone together. I immediately felt the tension between us jump up to about an eleven, and the awkwardness was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I started shifting around uncomfortably and saying the most awkward shit, just trying to fill the silence, while my ex just sat there.

She finally cuts through my ramblings by saying, ""We need to talk.""

I start laughing uncomfortably and I tell her we can't talk here. Not here, not at our friend's party. We can talk after or another time but not right now.

But she cuts me off and says something like, ""I have something to say to you. I just need to say it, then I'm done. It was really messed up to break up with me over text.""

That caught me completely off guard. I was left speechless for a moment, before I finally sputter out something like, ""You ignored all my phone calls.""

She said she was trying to give me space. She said she didn't want to call me back until she was sure I had cooled down enough, and wouldn't be mad at her anymore. 

I told her that if she had let me make that decision for myself, she would have gotten a break up in person.

We went back and forth a little more, I don't remember exactly what was said since my adrenaline was pumping pretty hard at this point, but I do remember saying something about how she treated me poorly during our relationship. In response, she pulled out that whole, ""I have baggage, and I put up walls to protect myself, I didn't mean to hurt you"" line again, and I...I just completely lost my temper at her.

I started to yell at her. I remember yelling, ""Just because you didn't mean to do something hurtful doesn't fucking change that the fact that you did something hurtful!"" The rest of it is kind of ab blur, but I remember saying to her that ""I didn't mean to"" is not a Get Out of Jail Free card. Having baggage is not an excuse to treat someone, especially your own fucking *girlfriend*, like shit. Lying to your girlfriend, and using your *kids* as part of that lie, is a really fucked up, hurtful thing to do, and she needed to own that, not blame it on her past relationships. 

There were a few other things I said, but I can't remember. After I let all that rage and fury lose, my girlfriend was crying. Shit, I was crying, too. All our friends were coming back in at that point from smoking, being like, ""What the hell is going on in here?""

I don't remember what I said in response, but I basically just grabbed my stuff and ran out the door. I didn't even get to properly say goodbye to my friend who was moving away. 

I just went home and cried...but it was more in a cathartic, anxiety-releasing way, instead of a being sad kind of way, if that makes sense. It was just really...liberating to finally be able to get all that off my chest.

The next morning, I got a couple texts from my friends, most of which were like, ""Uuuhhh...heard about what happened. You all right?"" Even my friend who was moving away checked in on me. I apologized for making a scene at his party and he forgave me. I even managed to run over to his place the night before he was going to leave just to say goodbye to him properly.

Oh, and...guess who fucking posted about what happened the night on Fetlife the next day?

It was titled, ""I'm Stronger Than This"" or something equally stupid. I clicked on it, and there was all this -- god, y'all, I only skimmed it, but there was just...there was just so much fucking bullshit. How she experienced ""something traumatizing,"" but she isn't ""going to let something like this"" hold her back and how she ""deserved so much better"" and...I don't even fucking know. It was such bullshit, it was all such bullshit, our whole entire relationship was *such bullshit*. 

There was a big part of me that wanted to leave a comment that said, ""GIRL. DON'T EVEN FRONT."" I didn't...and instead, I just deactivated my Fetlife account. I originally joined that website when I was first getting into kink and BDSM so that I could keep track of events in the community, but now that I'm pretty established within it, I can just...you know, *ask* people if anything is going on. 

Anyway...there's one more little bit of drama to add to this. I just found out that my ex-girlfriend has just started dating my ex-boyfriend. He was always been the type to end up with women who are ""projects."" Honestly, that's part of the reason why we broke up. He kept trying to ""fix"" me, but I like the way I am, and I don't need to be fixed. He'll have a hell of a project with my ex-girlfriend...

I'm not going to lie, though, I have a lot of mixed feelings about that...most of those feelings are just sadness. I keep thinking there must be something inherently wrong with me as a girlfriend. Objectively, I know this isn't true. Both my exes obviously have a lot of issues, but still, it's hard not to somehow think this is a reflection on me. I mean, I'm sure it IS a reflection on me, but more in a ""I need to stop picking people who are bad matches for me,"" instead of ""I'm a terrible girlfriend, which is why none of my relationships ever seem to work out.""

But...whatever. I'm doing everything I can to move past all this. I've started working out, I've been spending time as much as possible with friends and family, I've started planning a solo vacation for sometime next year. I might go back into therapy for a while, and I'm definitely, definitely not going to be dating anyone again anytime soon.

Anyway...thanks again, everyone, for your help and advice. I really appreciate it.

Daniel got in touch with me yesterday, to apologize. I listened to him, merely so I could formally request he not contact me again. I told him he should likely get in touch with Kay, because he would need to help raise the baby, I would not be offering her aid. 

He said it was a mistake and he was upset because I seemed to be doing better than him. Kay had been more understanding of his flaws in the past. I said that disliking him drinking and not wanting to jump right into marriage/kids did not make me a bad person.

I said again, ""I do not wish to contact you again."" I also texted this to him and wrote it down in an e-mail. He promised to drop contact and I hope he keeps his word. I will be pressing charges if he does not. 

On the matter of Kay, she returned to my apartment when I was not home. I had a friend crashing on my couch and they were well aware not to let her in. I have a picture of her taped on the door with the words, ""This is Kay [Last name], she is not to be let into the house, given any money, or talked to. If she shows up, please contact me immediately so I may speak to the police."" This is the same thing I gave to the management, who said she had come by claiming to be my sister and needing ""medication"" she left in my apartment. 

They said that they refused her and she started crying. She was escorted to the parking lot, where she refused to move for about an hour. I guess she was waiting for me. 

My friend did not let her in and she was still sitting on the stoop when I arrived. I verbally asked her to leave. She refused. I took a picture of her with my phone. I repeated again, please leave. When she would not, I called the police, told them what was going on, and they came to talk to us. 

She left. She tried to contact me again. I called the police again. 

She showed up this morning to speak with me again and I called the police on her again. She kept saying ""I live with her"" but when I let the police into the apartment to check it out, they asked her how she slept in an apartment with one bed, an office, and a couch that does not fold out. I said she did not live there, explained the story, showed them the texts, and they took her down to the station. 

I followed and said I would like to start the process of charging her with stalking and getting a restraining order. Not sure how this will go. But that is my update.

I like his sister and enjoy her company but I'm in school and greatly value my quiet, private time on my mornings. When she shows up in the morning she's not exactly inconspicuous. I already have a hard time studying with other people around which is why I don't just go to the library. I had explained needing a space to study quietly in a potential apartment and the arrangement was that I'd study while he was at work. I don't know why there was no mention of her hanging out at his place to get away from her roommate-crammed house.     

I understand my boyfriend and his sister are close so he doesn't mind unexpected visits but I'm very reserved and private and several times have wished I had some notice to put things away and freshen up (or even just knocking so I can put on appropriate clothes!) before she comes over. When I say things like this to my boyfriend he just waves it off as her being family and not minding but it's more about me minding!  

I'm worried because it feels like I'm starting to resent the situation, especially when I'm struggling to concentrate on homework because I ended up paying more rent for less amenities and a longer commute to school so my boyfriend could stay in his place where he's comfortable. I know I have to say something or it will just eat me up but what are reasonable limits and how do I phrase it?

So after posting, I stuck to only eating food I'd made and my bf got more and more antsy about cooking for me. I sat him down the next day and asked him the same stuff: if he had a problem with my vegetarianism, why he was trying to contaminate my food: since I asked WHY and not IF, he blew up. Demanding to know why I didn't trust him, how I could accuse him of this. He also kept trying to get me to explain why I'm veggie in the first place, but he knows this well so I didn't let him derail the conversation. Eventually, after the most frustrating, circular argument ever, he stormed off to our bedroom. We didn't speak that night or the morning.

When I got home the next day, he'd actually gone and cooked an entire chicken ""for us"". He asked me if I'd eat it. It was so surreal: him stood at the kitchen counter with this cooked chicken asking me to eat it when he's never known me to eat meat, as if we hasn't been arguing about this at all. I didn't even respond. I shouldered my way past him to the fridge ... which was a massive mistake. I guess he went a little nuts. I still can't really believe this happened, but he grabbed me by my hair at the back on my head and with another hand tried to force chicken into my mouth.

I am still shocked by this. It was terrifying, he was so much stronger than me. He didn't succeed and after some moments of me struggling, he let go. He just stood there, looking defeated while I literally ran out of the kitchen and got some stuff and went to my parent's. I'm there now, it's been the better part of a week. He's agreed to move out: put up no fight for the flat or for us (which I wouldn't accept of course anyway). When we spoke on the phone to decide this, he sounded ashamed. Quiet. I hope he's ashamed. 

I'll never know why he suddenly snapped about my vegetarianism and I frankly don't care anymore, he's obviously just a wanker to do that anyway. This past month or so has been so different to the test of our relationship, it's crazy, but there's no coming back from this. I'm well shot of him.

Original post.

Well here I am as promised.


Well I had to get everything ready which was hard to do with her tied to my hip but I managed.

I had my sister take her out for a little bit and made the dinner reservations and set everything up. When she came home holy.shit. I've never been in an avalanche of kisses and hugs before in my life.

The next day we went to dinner and talked about life after the baby which of course she got emotional about (lol).

After I took her to see a movie (Deadpool) and took her to the spot where we had our first kiss (corny I know) and than I did it I proposed.

She said yes and cried Soooooo much that it left my shirt with a giant wet spot. We got home and she wouldn't let go of me until we went to bed in the morning she was really happy and was smiling ALOT.

She is doing better now and less clingy (I'm starting to miss it a little) and has started doing stuff. Like reading and cleaning.

She's a great woman honestly I've never met anyone like her and I hope we can be together for along time.

So there's the update it went better then okay.

691,dragan8,Relationships,4gcyud,1895,"Posting here because I'm conflicted, I usually think that if everyone dislikes your SO its for good reason. I've been dating my girlfriend for around nine months now and she met my family and friends. While people technically like her, they think that we shouldn't be together because they don't think she's smart enough for me and they see her as a trophy girlfriend. 


I'm divorced. My ex was a smart corporate type person. I usually try not to compare my new gf to her but she is completely different from my ex. She's a lot of fun, a lot more adventurous and really upbeat. She's great with my son. That said... She isn't that smart. She doesn't follow world news or politics and can't carry on a conversation about any of the topics. She is terrible at math. She's interested in simpler things. She dropped out of college to pursue a career in baking, and she has been really successful in doing so. She owns a bakery with her friend, her friend manages it and she deals with the day to day work. She's done very well for herself but she has a hard time relating to my family and friends. 


All of my friends and most of my family are pretty successful, most of them are highly educated and have interesting jobs. That's not to say that she isn't successful or that she doesn't have an interesting job, she's just completely different from the other people I'm around. There have been lots of comments like ""it's a good think she's hot,"" from them and I always shut them down but it makes me think they will never respect her. A few people have asked why I even like her, which is surprising because she is a very likeable person, but I think it's because they just can't relate to her at all. 


Does our relationship stand a chance? No one seems to think so and its starting to make me doubt it. I do love her a lot, for what it's worth. I have an insanely stressful job and I love that when I see her after, she never has anything to complain about and she is a genuinely good and happy person.

TL;DR. First serious relationship for both of us. We entered a rough patch when I was cramming for my medical school finals. She cheated a couple nights before my finals with a colleague from her pharmacy. She tried to make amends but I cant seem to care.

Thanks for the advice everyone. Several posts really hit home. Firstly, that she is being selfish by pushing to continue the relationship. Secondly, my feelings are justified even if my friends keep pushing for reconciliation. Thirdly that breaking up is the way to go. Fourthly that if I loved her I would be able to forgive. Those words and some introspection got me to understand that the ambivalence I am feeling towards her is because I dont love her anymore. The moment she cheated is the moment when all my love was replaced with disgust and I am just wasting both of ours time. I realised the only reason I hadnt broken up with her was because I was being meek/lazy/going for the path with least resistance. Well 2 days ago I decided to man up and do the deed.


I took the day off work. I called 3 mutual friends and they came to my apartment to pack her stuff up. I then called her over to visit me after work (she had a halfday). When she came over I explained to her why I was breaking up and that I am giving back her stuff and the gifts she bought and will reimburse her for the Antartica trip. I told her I dont love her anymore, all I feel is disgust and its been a few months, these feelings wont change and the relationship is dead. She wailed and cried and said she'd do better/give her another chance/ I am the only man for her/ we are supposed to get married/have kids etc/ dont throw our future away etc. Frankly all her emotions had no effect on me. I just couldnt give a single fuck which just confirmed my intuition was right. She started causing a scene so my mutual friends escorted her out. She took her stuff but left me her gifts and said she doesnt want my money. I told her to keep NC and lose my number + give me back my house keys. We parted and I thought that was that.


As I said her parents are crazy traditional Indians. My dad called me yesterday to tell me about the shenanigans my exgf's parents pulled. After I broke up exgf went to her parents house. Exgfs dad and 2 brothers then stormed into my parents house talking all sorts of trash about how I am a player/scumbag who ruined their daughter; how my family has no honour and I have to marry their daughter if we were decent people (lol). They also threatened to ruin our reputation in the Indian community if they dont. My dad told them that I broke up with her due to cheating not the other way around. My dad has proof and will tell the rest of the Indian community about their daughters whoring around if he hears anything negative about my family. They asked to see the proof so my dad showed them the emails exgf sent to me after her cheating which I had forwarded to my brother for his advice. Exgfs family apologised, asked us not to say anything and then left.

Today I got a couple of calls from mutual friends. Apparently exgfs parents are dragging exgf back to India and will probably get her arranged married. Some of my friends suggested I reconcile to save her from this. I told them to shut up and stop trying to influence my love-life. If they feel so bad about the situation then they should go marry her before she gets taken to India. if they cant respect my feelings then they should lose my number. Frankly I couldnt care less about some of these mutual friends. Ive made new friends at work so I dont care if I lose some old friends over this break up.


Emotionally these last 2 days have been fantastic. Ive been busy at work and loving every moment of it (even the crap parts when I had to do a rectal exam on some 60 year old guy). It feels a weight has been lifted off of me. Im going to focus on being single for the next year and just enjoy it. My parents are also glad I broke up. Apparently they hated ex-gf because she had no clue about her indian background (couldnt speak the language, didnt know our history etc). They've gotten off my back about marriage and said they wouldnt push for it for at least the next few years. Everything's coming up Milhouse. I just hope theres no more bollywood style shenanigans/drama from exgfs parents. 


tl;dr: Broke up. Some drama happened but I feel much better. I hope exgf fixes her life up but Im not going to be her knight in shining armour by marrying her to stop her getting arrange married in India.

694,,Relationships,2x1eq2,1892,"My daughter called me at 1 AM this morning (my TZ) crying, telling me that my wife had forcibly removed her from the house. My understanding of the event is that they got into an argument, which escalated to the point that my wife demanded my daughter leave the house. As my daughter tells it, and I believe her, my wife threatened to call the police and have them kick her out if my daughter did not do it herself. My wife stood over her with the phone in her hand while my daughter quickly packed a small backpack and left. She left my daughter standing on the curb, with no money, as my lovely wife took the scissors to my daughter's card which is attached to our joint account. I had to get a friend of mine to pick my daughter up and loan her money for a hotel.    

I've called my wife at least a dozen times since all of this occurred, and she only answered the first time. He only words were ""I'm dong what's best for you and me"", and hung up. It's obvious at this point that she is actively ignoring my subsequent calls. 

This situation needs to be contextualized. My daughter started her first semester of college last fall. My daughter wanted to follow in my footsteps (but also, for lack of anything else she was interested in), and become an engineer. Now look, my daughter is extremely intelligent, but she is not academically gifted, and she is poor at mathematics. She is not cut out to be an engineer. Both my wife and I recognized this. My position was that there is no harm in her trying, and that there is no substitute for legitimate interest, which she seemed to have. My wife took the pessimistic view. She thought our daughter needed a dose of reality, and she gave it to her. At first kindly, then not so kindly. That caused a lot of friction between them, and if I'm being honest they have never been that close. My daughter resisted, and actually got really motivated to prove her wrong. I helped her get through a calculus textbook over the summer, and she started last fall taking classes to become an electrical engineer.

She gave it the ole' college try (pun intended) but it didn't work out. She was disappointed, and decided to not go back for the spring semester. She didn't know what she wanted to do, but my wife was furious when she told us. My wife started nagging my daughter to go back but she didn't. She needs time to figure out what she wants to do.

Things were fine, but about a month ago my wife ""suggested"" that we ""motivate"" our daughter by kicking her out. I told her politely, ""not happening"", a few times, but she kept bringing it up. Finally, a few days before my business trip, she brought it up really forcefully, and I responded by essentially saying ""If I'm going to kick out anyone it's you. Now shut up and drop it."" Yes, I now regret the phrasing, but at the time I didn't. She did seem to drop it for the last few days I was there, then, a week and a half later this happens. 

I'm considering a divorce. This is unforgivable to me on so many levels. What she did to our daughter, when she did it, how she did it; every aspect of this decision is wrong, a breach of trust, and my authority. However I'm also one to allow for the fact that I'm fallible, so I'm looking for different views that might help me understand what on earth my wife could be thinking or why this could in any way be a justifiable thing to do. 

EDIT: For clarity, my wife is my daughter's biological mother.

So I didn?t confront Kathy during break. I didn?t even get to decide whether or not I wanted to because as soon as my break started, my Supervisor, Linda approached me. Linda explained that she knew Kathy reached out to me about the office clique.

That she knows I don?t hold these events but I should speak on Kathy?s behalf. I said I understood when another Supervisor,Dan butted in.

They discussed it among themselves and cited that people have used the company email to send out invites. This allowed the Supervisor to see the exchanges between everyone. Kathy had been invited and bluntly stated no to several things/not to waste her time. 

Linda apologized to me and told me to forget about the Kathy issue but the core message still counts. 

When I went to the break room, Kathy made a bee line for me. She started questioning me about how my talk with the Supervisor went. How together we could take down the ageist office group and that we should get coffee after work.  

I lied saying I had a family thing and went home. At home, I checked the reddit post and went back onto Kathy?s fb. There was a new post about how she was playing a little office prank on the office idiot. People commented her to ?spill? but she didn?t update them. I feel like that was about me. 

I started screen capping her posts, though only the ones that flat out bullied people. I felt like HR would care about those then any grey areas. Aside from the racist post about Brad, she made a post about a plan to sleep with a married coworker by getting him drunk. 

All of this has been weird. At work, Kathy is a professional, determined and a little head strong. But in this field, thats a good thing. She gets good scores/reviews from clients. But now all I see is her posting vile things about people I care about. Calling it ?TruthTea? then running to me like a victim of a make believe problem. 

I?m going to avoid her unless we?re on a project together. I don?t want to be her flying monkey. I don?t know what to believe from her anymore. 

TL;DR: Didn't confront Kathy but she got a Supervisor to talk to me. We found out she was lying and now I'm avoiding her. 

Edit: To answer someone who PM-ed me. Yes, I have high functioning autism. Yes, people at work know. 

Edit 2:

HR emailed me back. They said they were calling Kathy into work this weekend. Since the office isn't open the weekends, it's clear she's in trouble. As advised from an earlier reply, I'm not going to check her FB anymore. Though watching the fall out would be nice/have a laugh, I would feel petty (?)

I don't think Linda was trying to force me to do anything. She understands that I don't get some social things (If you check out my last post/replies, I literally said Kathy should just ask to be included). She was just trying to explain it in a way I'd understand. 

I fixed ""budded"" to ""butted"". Thank you for catching that.

I looked into the term ""Flying monkey"", and another subreddit came up (RBN). The people described there sound a lot like Kathy. 

I'm signing out now so I won't be replying until Monday. Sorry. 

Edit 3:
It looks like she was fired over the weekend. Her desk is empty but dented. I think she put up a fight because some coworker's desk decor are damaged. 

I won't be checking her FB to see the fall out. I have blocked her and am hoping for the best.

It's been a couple of months since my last post, so I think you all deserve a happy update! 

First of all, thank you, Reddit! I sincerely mean that. I was just a shy girl with a crush on a handsome stranger and to think that he's now my boyfriend is just nuts. I can't even describe how happy I am!

Two months ago, I left off by mentioning that I was going to take him on a date and show him around the area a little bit since he just moved here. I talked about how we both love hiking, so I planned to take him to this lighthouse, which is only a short drive from where we live. I was afraid it was going to rain but it turned out to be the perfect day. We packed a little picnic and spent an afternoon hiking. I thought it was so romantic. We had a great time!

Over the next couple of weeks, we continued to see each other and go on fun dates...

I wanted to take things to the next level SO bad but I wanted to wait to make sure he felt the same way about me. After a couple weeks of dating, we were hanging out at his place one night cuddling/watching a movie and that's when he finally asked me if we could be exclusive! It was the best night! So we've been in an exclusive relationship for a couple of months now but I feel like I've known him forever. We just ""click.""

Anyway, he has a huge family and they had Thanksgiving last weekend, which I was invited to. He begged me to come. I'm a shy person so I was a little nervous, but they made me feel so welcome. His mother's a total sweetheart and his dad is hilarious. When we were leaving, I gave his parents hugs and his mom says to me, ""You know, he talks about you all the time! He's like madly in love with you."" My boyfriend was so embarrassed... I've never seen him get so red! hahaha!

I invited him to my family's Thanksgiving as well and my family loved him, which was a huge relief because my dad hasn't liked ANY of my past boyfriends. But he immediately took a liking to him and had to show him around his ""shop"" because they're both into cars. It was so nice to finally bring a guy home that Dad approves of! And of course, my mom and aunts thought he was a hunk. lmao. Talk about awkward.

Anyway, I just figured I'd let you know how the date went and that we're finally a couple! Thanks for all your help a couple months ago when I wanted to ask him out! You guys really encouraged me, so thank you!

My mom is marrying this guy and he has 4 kids. He's a cool guy and doesn't mind me, the way that some of her guys have. He usually brings food for me if he's bringing her some and he even got me a gift for my birthday last month. But because of the 4 kids, they don't think there's room. 

They think I'm too old to share with his 11 year old son. But he only has him every other weekend and I wouldn't mind.

I'm not a bad kid. I make ok grades and I don't cause trouble. I even do most of the house work because my mom's out so much. So it's not that she wants to ship a problem kid away. She just thinks there isn't enough room. But I really don't mind.

698,brokenheartedsister,? Locked Post ?,3uj509,1892,"Hi Reddit. I'm posting here in the hope that someone can give me some advice, share their experiences, I don't know. I'm just completely at a loss. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.

My fiance (let's call him Jake) and I have been together for 7 years. I don't know a life without him. I met him at university, we stayed together past graduation, and moved into a flat which we bought together 2 years ago. He proposed last summer and we were set to wed in July 2017. We have had very few problems until now.

My sister (let's call her Sara) is an extremely volatile person. Growing up, I doted on her completely but she had a lot of personal issues that made our home life turbulent. Her childhood was very different to mine. My parents had very little money, they were on the brink of a divorce, my dad was physically violent on a number of occasions. Whilst things improved drastically in the years after I was born, she has an abundance of problems that stem back to this. My parents feel a lot of guilt about Sara's upbringing, and used to let her get away with some shocking behavior. 

Sara had the same boyfriend for as long as I can remember (they dated from when they were 16), and their relationship was toxic. They habitually broke up and got back together; when they were good, they were crazy in love. But more often than not, she would have these insane arguments (sometimes physical) with him then take out her frustrations and despair on myself and my parents. I remember spending many nights lying by her side in bed while she cried so hard she would retch. After their arguments, she would throw plates and glasses at the wall, hit herself. Sometimes she would hit me and my parents too. It was like he was a drug to her, and she was emotionally stunted and didn't know how to see anything past their relationship. 

2 months ago, her boyfriend called things off for good. I don't know what gave, but after nearly two decades together, he finally had enough. He booked a one way ticket to another country, changed his number, deleted all social media profiles, and essentially disappeared from Sara's life. To this day, she still won't explain what caused this, but it was long overdue. 

To say Sara was devastated is an understatement. She moved out of their shared rented apartment, and in with my parents. I would visit her most days after work, where she would flit in between explosive rage to an almost catatonic silence, staring at the wall with tears streaming down her face. At one point, we were all extremely worried she might seriously harm herself and organized for her to see a therapist (something I had suggested for years). Of course, she backed out days before her appointment, and there were no consequences. She is, after all, a grown woman. She just hasn't changed emotionally in the entire time I've known her, and still acts like a teenager.

2 days ago. I went to visit Sara, who was in bed in her darkened room. I let myself in and attempted to speak to her, telling her about my day at work. She immediately exploded, screaming at me, throwing her pillows across the room, crying uncontrollably. She told me life was unfair. That I had everything and she was left alone to ""rot"". That everything wrong in her life was because she was a bad person. She hurt her boyfriend, she drove him away, she's ruined our family, **she fucked Jake and didn't even feel guilty at the time**. I initially thought I'd misheard her, but then she said it again. It was like she had poured a bucket of ice water over me.

I silently left, shaking. When I got home, Jake was there watching TV. It came out of my mouth the second I saw him, and I could see in his eyes it was true. He broke down, and told me it had happened 3 years ago. Sara had had another blazing row with her boyfriend and decided to drive round to Jake's looking for me. I was at our parents at the time and Jake attempted to pacify Sara. He comforted her while she sobbed in his arms, and one thing led to another. They had sex.

I packed an overnight bag while he followed me from room to room, sobbing and telling me it was the worst mistake of his life, that he still has no idea how it happened. That he felt unbelievably guilty the second it was over, that it feels like it wasn't even real. I left him in the doorway begging me not to leave.

I've checked into a hotel and have switched my phone off. I don't know what to do, who to tell, where to begin. I feel sick, like this is a bad dream. My heart feels like it's been ripped into a million pieces. For all of Sara's faults, I love her more than anything. It's the two people who are more to me than anyone else in the world.

How the fuck do I move on from this? I feel like I'm in a bubble. I don't know what's going on in the outside world. All I do is cry and sleep in this room. Someone please help me make sense of this.

699,milvian_bridge,Non-Romantic,7dm941,1889,"*Gracias all you helpful people.  I've cooled down quite a bit from this morning and your comments helped me realize that I shouldn't think of the house as just mine.  I still think it's weird but I think I'll be okay telling her it creeped me out having someone in the house without expecting it.  Also, I now know about 75 different places to buy locks, should I ever need to.*

I have a short term contract job on a very rural college campus.  There's only 75 people here, including staff.  I've been here for three months, I have one more to go.  My boss is really quirky, but in general I like her.  We teach art.

This morning I skipped breakfast (staff is provided breakfast and lunch) because I've got a cold and don't feel so great.  I live alone, but when I got out of the shower, I heard someone walking around in my house.  I was dripping wet, wearing only a towel and I rushed to my bedroom door to see who it was.  I opened the door and my boss was standing outside my bedroom, with some random cell phone in her hand.  She asked ""Is this yours??""  I seriously stood there with my mouth open for about 3 seconds before saying no.  Then she told me she was heading to work.  I don't even think I responded, just shut my door.  

I took this job because it's an amazing place to put on my resume and it WILL get me jobs after this.  I'm NOT okay with this.  I'm fuming mad at the weird invasion of privacy.  How do I approach her to say I'm livid that she thought she could walk into my house at 8 in the morning just to ask me a dumb question?  Why would someone think that's okay?  Now she's accusing me of not being myself today.  I can't even look at her without feeling angry.  How do I approach this without being mean/angry?  I NEED this job for future referrals!  

EDIT TO ADD:  The campus is the entire town.  There are only 75 people in the surrounding 10 miles- NONE of the buildings on campus have locks except the school store and the directors office.  I can't add one.  The only ""common area"" of the house is the kitchen and it has a separate entrance.  It is NOT a dorm.  Anytime there is going to be a guest instructor staying in my house, I'm given advance notice.

700,sakoyades,Relationships,74nxhe,1887,"The holidays are coming up soon and since we spent last Christmas with my girlfriend's family, we are spending this Christmas with my family. My parents live in a pretty boring farming town, so we decided that we would travel somewhere for Christmas. It would be my parents, my sister, my sister's boyfriend, me, and my girlfriend travelling together, and my dad would be paying for all of us (flights, hotel or cruise tickets, everything). We were deciding between two options, a Caribbean cruise or winter activities in Northern Canada - snowshoeing, hot springs, snowmobiling, aurora borealis. I love the snow and get quite seasick, so my vote was for Canada (plus white Christmas wooh!). My girlfriend voted for the Caribbean. In the end, we all voted and there were more votes for Canada 4-2. 


So I told my girlfriend this and she responds with ""I do NOT want to go to Canada. You should have voted for the one that I wanted to go to. What the fuck are we going to do in Canada? It's cold, this resort doesn't look like it has been upgraded since the 80's, we're going to be stuck with your parents all week. At least if we were on a cruise ship, we could get away from them. Ugh.""
 I was kind of put off by this... I've been wanting to see the Northern Lights since I was 12 and I was actually really excited to spend my holidays hanging out in a cabin by the fire, reading a book and chilling out with my parents and sister, whom I haven't seen in almost 2 years. 


I almost want to tell my girlfriend ""Nobody is forcing you to come, if you're just going to be miserable and complaining the whole time, then just stay here with your family!"". But I know this will just result in her getting beyond angry at me. I understand that she is disappointed she doesn't get to go on a cruise and go to the beach... but I feel like she is telling me to ignore what I want and just agree with what she wants all the time. And her comment about having to spend time with my family really annoyed me. Her parents live about 20 minutes away from us so we see them every other Sunday for lunch and every single holiday (Easter, Columbus Day,Thanksgiving, siblings and parents birthdays). Does she not realize how much time I have spent with her parents these past 3 years compared to my own? 


I don't know what to do here. I feel like my girlfriend is being really selfish, but am I the one who is being selfish? Should I have voted to go to the Caribbean, knowing beforehand that that is what my gf wanted? I actually didn't really say anything after my girlfriend's comment. I was just so annoyed at everything she said that I felt it better not to respond at the moment. 

**Edit**: Hi everyone, thank you so much for all your comments. I did not think that I would get so many responses @_@ I am at work right now so I can't reply to everything, but I am definitely reading every single one of your comments. A lot of you are saying that there is only 1 thing to do, and should've been done yesterday. But I think I'm going to have to do a lot of thinking and I'll post an update when things get figured out. This is a throwaway account, so I'll write down the username and password somewhere haha. Again, thanks everyone. And for all of you who are asking where we're going, we're going to a resort just outside of Yellowknife!

I'm good friends with her ex, and he made the mistake (and since apologized) of giving her mother my phone number. Friend used to complain about her parents and their lack of compassion and love, and also about their abusiveness. So I knew this was probably going to be rough hearing from them. She asked me what the ""hell I was thinking"" and ""do you have any idea what you've put [me] though."" ""How does this make me look."" I'm not sorry for what I did, and it's clear the doctors felt it prudent to keep her there for the past two days. She's still not out yet.

**One Year Ago**

I go to school with my twin sister. Myself and her are identical so there has always been a serious competitive aspect between us. Every guy I like she has to go after, every achievement I get she needs one up me. Gray before he was our step brother went to the same school as us. Before he was our step brother I thought he was really cute, he was nice, humble. I am pretty good looking me and my sister both are.

Gray was in my Math class and I would sit next to him. He was super nice, he was always so nice. We became friends and I wanted to ask him out but I was always to scared too. Because of my parents divorce several years prior to this, I thought it would be a good idea to get a diary. That way my emotions were not bottled up. I enjoyed the concept of a dairy so I kept doing it. I wrote down the fact that I thought Gray was really cute and I wish I had enough courage to ask him out. 

**Nine months Ago**

So my parents have been divorced for several years at this point. I knew my mom had been seeing someone. One Saturday night she was taking me and my sister out to meet her new partner. We walked in and we saw Gray sitting down at a table with a man. We would come to find out my mom was dating his dad. All three of us were freaking out about the chances of that happening, our parents were even more surprised then we were. Turns out my mom and step dad work together go figure. 

Several weeks after that our parents announced they would be getting Married. Gray still said to me ""Guess we are brother and sister now, it's still so crazy"". 

**Two Months ago**

Our parents got married and we moved in together. I, Mom and My sister would come to find Gray walks around the house without a shirt on. He does it because she had shoulder surgery and, he has really broad shoulders. He says shirts make him feel really uncomfortable and it bothers his arm. 

My sister still said to me "" Bet you like that"" and she winked at me. I was confused as hell because I have never said anything to her about it. This point in time I was working on getting over my attraction towards Gray. 

I asked her what is she talking about and she aloud a quote from my diary. She went into my room and took pictures of what I said about Gray months ago. She basically said "" You do what I say or, I will show this to Gray and Mom. Do you understand me?""

Ever since then she makes me lie for her when she goes out. Whether it be the mall, out with boys, the beach and she will make me lie for her and say she is at her friends house studying. She will take money out of my wallet and, she goes out with friends and spends my money. 

She stole $50  from me and went to Walmart and Burger king with her boyfriend after school. Every time I tell her to stop she threatens to tell mom and Gray. 

Gray has put a shirt on to be more considerate of me and my sister. It just annoys him and you can see it, but I have not seen him without his shirt for weeks 

 **Today**

Today is mothers day as I am sure most of you know. She is threatening to tell mom about what I wrote in my diary. She said and I quote "" Next year you will buy me my Junior Prom dress, unless you want me to tell mom about this. I am sure you don't want me to tell mom on mothers day""

When I mentioned it to my husband he said I could go but also made a comment about how it was a weird way to celebrate her birthday. I thought his comment was rude but I let it go. 

Last night he said we needed to talk about the trip. He's concerned that my sister and her friend are both single- he said it doesn't look good. I asked him to elaborate and he said I don't understand, and can't understand, from his perspective. We talked for awhile but we weren't getting anywhere.

- He's going to randomly check in with me. I have to answer his calls or respond to texts within 10 minutes

I'm kind of offended. I have never cheated or given him reason to suspect I was cheating. He's never accused me of cheating. I don't get drunk, put myself in vulnerable situations or behave irresponsibly.

I couldn't wait until Saturday. On Tuesday, I asked him when he was flying back in from vacation and he told me he was flying in around 12:30 AM on Thursday, so I told him I wanted to come over to his house after work that day (today) to talk. He apparently had plans with another coworker of ours (which I was salty about because I figured that he would want to see his girlfriend, of all people, after being gone for two weeks) but he blew them off because it sounded important.

So I went over to his house tonight with a box of his things and gave him the spiel. I said pretty much everything I said in my post then basically laid it down to, ""If you're not into me anymore, I'd understand, but please just break up with me so we can find people who are better suited to us, and if you are into me still, then you need to show it."" The entire time he nodded his head and looked very understanding.

Once I was done talking, he admitted that he had indeed been distant for the past month and a half, particularly the past three weeks. He then explained that the reason for this is because he realized that we have very different aspirations for the future and he has been racking his brain and talking to everyone trying to find a way to make it work. I asked him what he wanted that I didn't and he said.....kids. 

He wants kids within the next couple of years. He said he thinks he'd make a really great dad, and he knows that I'm young and that's not something that I want, and even if it is, it wouldn't be something that I would want within the next couple of years. He told me that it was killing him inside that he couldn't think of a compromise that could work for us to be together because he loves me (first time he's every told me that, and the last). He said he didn't want to continue on in our relationship hanging onto 'maybes' only for us to end up resenting each other or pressuring each other into things we don't want. I let him know that I'm still growing and my thoughts on it could still change, and that right now, my main reservation with children is actual pregnancy and I could possibly see myself adopting. He shook his head and said he wanted children of his own.

He's right. 

We cried in each others arms, collected my things, and discussed our boundaries at the office. I let him know that I didn't regret our relationship and that I'm so thankful for all of the good that we had together. I thanked him for being so good to me and for showing me the way that I deserve to be treated in a relationship (before the emotional distancing, of course). He then told me that he was honored to be my first boyfriend as he understood how big of a step that was for me to take and said that I'm the best girlfriend he's ever had and I've showed him love more than anyone he has ever dated before, including his ex-fiancee. He said that he felt for a long time that he didn't deserve love and I showed him that he did. We agreed that we were going to keep all of the gifts that we'd given to each other and that we needed some time apart to grieve but that we would still be friends and that we wished the best for each other in finding people who have the same aspirations for the future. He then walked me to my car for the last time.

Fuck, this sucks.

TLDR: Boyfriend was suddenly being distant, turns out it's because he realized that he wants kids within the next couple of years and that's not something I want or am able to commit to; he was trying to find a way to make it work but realized it was a non-negotiable for him. Even though he loves me, we broke up.

*****************************************

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words of support. I'm still hurting and I have spent a lot of time crying, and I'm sure I will for a while, but I will heal with time. The day after the breakup, I tried to avoid him at the office, but the few times I saw him on accident I could tell he was hurting. It hurts me to see him hurt. I have not spoken to him since and will not do so for quite a while as I don't want to reopen the wound. I also deleted Whatsapp from my phone, as that was what we used to message each other and I am trying to break the habit of consistently checking my phone to hear from him.

Due to some of my current life circumstances, many aspects of my life have been based off of things that would make me happy while still being feasible/convenient for other people in my life (mainly my mother), not necessarily what I truly want for myself. Before my former (I choose to refer to him as my former as opposed to my ex, because I think ex just sounds too harsh and has a negative connotation), I never would have thought marriage would be something that I'd want for myself. Now that I've been shown what a good relationship is like and what it feels like to love and be loved in return, I would really like to be married. Since I'd previously never even thought I wanted marriage, this is why I'd never really prioritized whether or not I want children. I have a bad habit of focusing on my present instead of my future.

I have decided that for the next few months (probably closer to half a year), I am going to make a point of prioritizing what I want for my future long-term in regards to what I think would make me happy. I?m going to start reflecting on if having children is something I think could be a fulfilling part of my life and if it would make me happy. I?m honestly not sure what children are like (my friends/close family don't have children so I never really spend time with any, which is another reason I haven't thought about it much) so I may see if I can find some opportunities to babysit or spend time with children in some other way to see if I like them and if I could see myself caring for one long term. I think it?s something I need to do to avoid this kind of heartbreak in the future. And if I do decide that I?d like to have children on the same timeline as my former does and it just so happens that my former is still single and he still wants to build a future with me, then I?ll see if he wants to pick up where we left off, but if it turns out that I just don?t want kids or I know I'm not going to be sure for a while, then I will hope someone with just as much love to give comes into my life who feels the same.

705,abuseed,Non-Romantic,56oob6,1878,"This situation is very fucked to put it likely. My ex and I grew up together, married young, and divorced about 5 years ago. We have two children, both under the age of 13. The divorce was mutual and we managed to maintain a very good relationship/friendship afterwards. We split custody 50/50 and would spend at least one weekend together with our children a month. 

About two years ago my ex met Asshole. Asshole is a terrible person and all around piece of shit. Unfortunately my ex was unable to see this for some reason and fell very hard for him. After about 6 months they moved in together. After they began living together, things started to decline very very rapidly. He began to prevent my ex from spending time with her friends/family. He encouraged her to quit her job and be a stay at home wife, and despite the fact that she was in a career she loved, she agreed. She stated spending 100% of her time with him (he works from home) and basically cut off everyone in her life. People expressed worry and as soon as they did, they were cut off b/c ""if they can't be happy that she is happy, they don't deserve her time"". 

Immediately after moving in together our monthly ""family weekends"" ended b/c he thought of them as disrespectful to their relationship. This despite the fact that he was welcome to join, just as my girlfriend has for the last 3 years. She stopped interacting with me at all ""out of respect for him"" and it got to the point where I could not talk to her unless it was through him. This all went on through the first year and a half. 

About 7 months ago or so he has started extending his behavior to my children. He attempted to force them to cut off people in their lives, even trying to home school them. He started bad talking me/my girlfriend to them and encouraging them to dislike us. My ex started doing the same. 

Then I found out he was beating her. I had my suspicions but before this point I had no proof. Then she was sent to the hospital with very severe injuries after ""falling down the stairs"". The stairs don't give you strangle marks on your neck. I had been asking my kids about this for months, but they never mentioned anything about violence and had always insisted that they liked their time at their mothers house. 

Come to find out it is because Asshole and my ex had basically convinced them that if they ""tattled"" about the abuse their mother would wind up in prison and they would never see her again. After this came out (while my ex was still in the hospital) i immediately took my children and got an emergency order for full custody. This was about 3 months ago. My children have not been allowed back at their mothers place since. I refuse to allow them to interact with Asshole at all. 

Their mother is welcome to visit them in a neutral space, but asshole is not allowing it and she is going along with it. My kids miss their mother and they are starting to resent me for keeping them away from her. I have done everything i can think of to give her a chance to remain in their lives. I have offered to allow sleep-overs at their grandparents (her side) with their mother. 

I have offered to allow her to stay at my home with the kids for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I would sleep elsewhere so she would have the place to herself with them. But she is not budging. She refuses to accept any visitation where her boyfriend is not present. Out of desperation I have even offered to allow visits at her place with her boyfriend present as long as I am able to chaperone for the entire time. 

Even this was rejected since ""it is disrespectful to her boyfriend"". I am at my wits end here. My ex has always been a confident, strong minded woman. She has been extremely successful (partner at her law firm by the age of 35) and has never been one to take shit from people. I don't understand how she can allow this man to break her like this. 

I don't understand how she is putting him, before her own kids. And now my kids are starting to blame me for keeping her away from them. Today, my youngest asked me why i hate her mom and don't want her mom to love them. I honestly don't know what to do. Please, just tell me, was i wrong to take full custody? Should I let her see them on her terms? He has never hit my kids or even been mean to them (as far as I know). 

He is actually overly nice to them, never yells at them or anything. But he actually will yell at my ex for discipling them. While i don't think they are at risk with him, i don't want them seeing that type of behavior and thinking it is ok. Reddit, just give some words please.

For the sake of ease, we?ll call my brother Sam and his wife Kate. Obviously not their real names. 

My brother Sam became engaged 8 months ago to Kate after a year of dating. They have a 3 month old son. Sam and I have never been super close with each other?..we are very different people and have very little in common. We were very different as kids?.I was always reading and he was always playing video games. He dropped out of school at 15, right when I went off to University. He was in trouble with the law for a while there and we didn't have much to do with each other. We get along civilly, but he does allow Kate to make an endless stream of side remarks to me which is a sore point for me. Sam never once sticks up for me, even when my parents have been shocked at what she says. Kate also tries to 'push me out' a lot by saying things like how she is my parents daughter. Basically, she has always tried to take my place to compensate for having had a crappy childhood with a single mother who didn't care about her. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean her behaviour isn't infuriating for me you know? 

Sam and Kate have decided to have a huge wedding and bacherlor/ettes in Thailand and are now expecting me to pay my own way there and book a 11 day trip to Thailand and pay for all my own expenses, including flights. They are taking out a loan to make the wedding possible because Kate has ?always wanted? a ?dreamy beach destination wedding?. (I think that is stupid. I mean it is their life and their finances but why hasn?t that clued them in on how it might also be unaffordable for their guests? If I didn't have savings, would they expect me to take a loan). 

They also want me to be a bridesmaid and given that Kate asked her 2 best friends 4 months ago (I saw it on instagram, she did the ?will you be my bridesmaid? proposal thing)?.I asked why they were asking now and they admitted one of Kate?s friends backed out because of the coats and they ?need another and there isn?t really anyone else?. They're angry at Kate's friend for backing out, but she agreed to be a bridesmaid *before* she knew they were planning on taking the wedding from Australia to Thailand. I?m not exactly thrilled about the idea of being a ?back up bridesmaid?, especially to someone I know dislikes me at worst, is indifferent to me at best. Eff that, tbh. This is going to cost *thousands* of dollars. My parents are not thrilled about the wedding, but are going along with it because they know any disagreement and my brother will take it out on them because whatever Kate wants, Sam makes sure she gets. My parents love their grandson and they know if they 'annoy' Kate too much, they can forget about seeing him. I think Kate knows that and uses her baby to get her way. 

This wedding is not how I want to spend my own money and it is now causing a big drama. 

Even before this became an issue, I was always of the opinion that expensive destination weddings are incredibly selfish and entitled because the couple is expecting their guests to pay a *lot* of money to attend and essentially dictating to them where their next holiday will be without considering they might want to go somewhere else. Go for your honeymoon, don?t make everyone else pay for that too. I mean, I personally have 0 interest in Thailand. I hate the beach??I?m a fair skinned strawberry blonde girl who hates hot weather and can?t go in the water with her contacts in so it?s just?..not my idea of fun at all. I don?t want to spend all my savings on a beach holiday I?ll hate. 

I can technically afford to go based on the balance of my savings account, but I?m saving for something important. I?m currently a masters student studying a double masters in European Union Law and French Translation and have been offered the chance to complete five months study in Paris next year and interning for a major government department for three months afterwards. That is my plan for the money I?ve been saving from my part time tutoring job. The wedding is being held during the internship. They want me to give it up even though it could be the big break of my career. This is how I want to use the money. There is now an expectation I?ll back out of this and go to the wedding and even pay to be Kate?s bridesmaid. 

I?ve said no. Sam is losing his shit because Kate is pissed off I?m not bowing to her wishes. My parents are urging me to reconsider. I know they think this is all bullshit (my father in particular thinks Kate is ridiculous), but they know the kind of hold Kate has over my brother and know if they even slightly upset her, he'll side with her and they might not see their grandkid. They enable her because she?s insane and entitled. 

Am I being the unreasonable one?

One of the things that makes Sam/Kate and I so different is that we have different goals and interests. I have an undergraduate Law/French degree (possible in my country) and am now studying a masters degree. Kate has said on Facebook that her goal is to get a husband so she ?doesn?t have to work? and can ?have babies?. Sam dropped out of school and works a blue collar job. I?m not looking down on that, but it means he doesn?t really understand how important opportunities like the one I have been offered are for careers like the one I am pursuing. We are very different people with very different goals in life, which is fine, but it means they don?t understand that giving up and opportunity like this could be giving up my ?big break? and to me, my career for the next 50 years is more important than someone?s wedding day. They *knew* I would be interning in Paris when they selected this date because I told them long before they picked a date. It makes me wonder if Kate knew what she was doing in picking this date. 

What do you think reddit? Am I the bad guy for saying I?m not spending all my money to indulge Kate?s ?fairytale wedding dream? and sticking to my study abroad/internship plans or do I have to suck it up?

707,Throwaway996997,Relationships,73ergu,1878,"So, my wife and I have been married for five years (together for 8 years).  Way back when, we decided that we wouldn't try for kids until after she had graduated from university.  That was all fine, she graduated three years ago, and she's in the workforce now.

Thing is though, she recently turned 30, and suddenly conception is the biggest thing in her life.  We've been trying to conceive for around a year, but no joy yet.  We've both been fertility tested, and the tests showed that we are capable of having children.

Thing is though, she has it in her head that I don't want children.  She thinks that I'm sabotaging her attempts to have a baby, that I don't want to be a parent, that I don't care about how she feels, now  she's getting older and time is ticking.

Thing is, I really, really would like to be a father, and she won't believe it.  It's become a big thing where she gets really pissed off with stupid things because she thinks that I don't want to have children with her.

708,IKilledATeddy,Relationships,2sml0e,1873,"My wife has a stuffed animal that she has had since she was born. We'll call it ""Teddy"" even though it is a dog. Anyway, she loves that fucking stuffed animal. It is... er... was, her favorite thing. Her grandmother (who passed away when my wife was 10), gave it to her and it has kind of been her security blanket throughout her entire life. When my Wife's mother would get physical/abusive, she would clutch the thing in cry. She told me on more than one occasion her mother tried to throw it away as she got older. She had to dig through the trash and ""save"" it and hid it from her mother until she was away at college. At one point when she was younger, her mother threw it in the dryer and singed the hair and laughed when she gave it back to her. Her mother wasn't a nice person, but that's neither her nor there, I'm just trying to tell you the connection she has with Teddy. Whenever she's been sick or had an injury/surgery, Teddy has been in bed with her comforting her. 


Anyway, a few weeks ago, my wife found out she was pregnant. We haven't told anyone yet (hence the throwaway account), and have been trying to keep my wife healthy throughout the flu season. She works as a teacher so we've been trying really hard to be sanitary. 

Long story short Teddy was filthy. Just absolutely disgusting after years of cuddling, sweat, tears, drool, and the occasional trash dive. I'd been after her for years to wash the thing but she was against it because of the dryer incident. I was finally able to convince her last night that it was time to wash it for her health's sake. We washed it on delicate and then put it on tumble dry (the tag was so faded and frayed you couldn't read the washing instructions), but our drier is a piece of shit and Teddy got caught somehow and was ripped apart inside the dryer beyond repair.

My wife is absolutely devastated and I feel so ridiculously guilty. I kept apologizing and she kept crying. She took the day off work today, partly because she is having bad cramps from the pregnancy, partly from the sadness of losing the favorite thing from her childhood. She was up in bed this morning crying because she was sick, and also because she didn't have Teddy there to be with her. 

I feel like I fucked up something fierce here reddit, how do I fix this? Is there a way to fix this? How do I make this all better?

**Edit 1**

I had no idea that these things could be fixed so easily. Users have been PMing me etsy links, stuffed animal hospitals, and seamstresses that can fix these things. I'm going to gather the remains of Teddy tonight and send a photo to one of these people, one of which is in the same state as we are. Hopefully they'll be able to fix Teddy and possibly make him look like he did even before her mom melted him in the dryer the first round. If that isn't an option then I'm going to do what /u/skyscan1 suggested and use Teddy's remains to make a few more stuffed things for the future baby. Thanks for the help guys.

**Edit 2** 

TIL Reddit loves stuffed animals. Like a whole lot. I did not anticipate this much help/support. Seriously thank you all.

**Edit 3**

A friend of her family is a professional seamstress and said she could get Teddy back right as rain. I would have taken any one of the seriously 10+ redditors that said they would do it for free but the convenience of the friend is too good to pass up (she also said she'd do it for free). So not only should Teddy get fixed, he should be good and we don't have to worry about him being lost through shipping. The wife has hope but it is tempered at the moment. I am excited to see how it turns out. I showed her this thread and all the support that came with it and she was moved to tears. If the seamstress doesn't get it all together then she will entertain the build-a-bear idea. Thanks again guys.

Hey beautiful people!

I wanted to update you guys because I got SO much excellent advice from people here and I wasn't able to reply to a lot of it because I was a little in my head at the time, so I wanted to be able to say THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you at once!

First of all, Greg and I are now officially broken up, and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off me. I am a LITTLE anxious about the possibility of him trying to get me back, but some of the stuff he said made me feel this isn't likely. (And for those of you who said to change my locks, etc. - he doesn't have a key to my place! But I am asking a friend to spend the night with me the next few nights just in case!)

So, what I ended up doing: I asked Greg to meet me earlier this afternoon at a park near his place. I sat on the edge of a fountain because it was a spot that was surrounded by people/had a lot of people looking towards it, but there was enough room that we could talk. I also had a guy friend of mine (Sam) sit off at a distance and asked him to keep an eye and he said he'd come over if anything went wrong or it looked like Greg was trying to hurt me or start a confrontation.

I planned out a whole explanation for Greg, including telling him that I wasn't going to reconsider but that I really thought he should get help for unaddressed issues from his childhood. He immediately said, ""I know. You're right. I'll get help. I've been wanting to get help for a while now."" To which I was like uh, no, you haven't, you've actually told me you think therapy is bullshit and refused to even discuss it, but good, get help. And then he said ""only if you stay with me,"" and I reiterated that wouldn't be happening.

He continued trying to talk me out of breaking up with him, like I knew he would, and made me sound really fucking crazy for thinking it was a good idea - he kept saying stuff like, ""you think it's abuse for me to hold your arms down when you're being a cunt and I don't know what crazy shit you're going to pull?"" (for the record, I have NEVER been violent to him, except in trying to get him away from me, and he has no reason to expect this from me)...and ""you just don't know what abuse is because you were spoiled"" and, when I would bring up specific instances, ""that never happened,"" ""you're making it sound so much worse than it was, I was just trying to de-escalate things,"" etc. - basically, giving up on telling me to stay and just trying to convince me I was making stuff up.

At some point, he got really tense and quiet and snide and he said ""really? You think that's abuse? You think this is abuse?"" and grabbed my arm really firmly and dug his nails in (I'm already getting bruises). I probably physically could have gotten away from him but I kind of felt like my brain shut down because it hurt more than what he's done in the past, and because it was kind of an unexpected perfect workaround for my plan...in that it probably didn't outwardly look like much (no one noticed) but still hurt.

He continued to basically go after everything he knows is a sore point for me...""you're just a spoiled bitch,"" ""you don't get it because the worst thing that's ever happened to you is that you regretted fucking someone"" (referring to a very traumatic forcible rape), ""you're a fat cunt anyway""...essentially, targeting everything that was an insecurity for me. I now see he's been doing that in our relationship for a long time in more subtle ways. He's very good at reading people's weaknesses and using them against people.

After he let go of me, I stood up and said ""NO"" (I couldn't really think straight) and started running towards Sam. Greg got up and tried to grab my arm and pull me back, and I stopped so he wouldn't yank my arm off. Sam saw this and came over and physically pulled him off me and told him it's over and he needs to leave me alone and walk away. Sam is a big, pretty intimidating-looking guy - a lot bigger than Greg, which was helpful here. Greg said ""fuck you both, she's got you believing her bullshit too,"" and then ""fuck you, you cunt, you don't deserve me,"" and walked away.

About an hour after that, he started texting me saying he was sorry, that he really wanted my help addressing his issues, that he knew exactly what he's done wrong and he can really acknowledge it now and change, that this was a breaking point for him and he felt so guilty for ""making me feel hurt,"" etc. (I should have blocked him earlier, but I was texting about where to meet up until he got there, and afterwards felt kind of shaken and forgot about it.) I blocked him on my phone and also on Facebook and Twitter. (You apparently can't really block people on gmail, only send their stuff to spam, but I did that too.)

I literally never want to see or hear from him again. I honestly thought I'd feel at least a little sad or guilty or ""what if""-y, but I'm not. I'm so happy to be done with him. After the way he spoke to me today, I can honestly say that I was just wrong about him. I thought he was a good person who just had issues, but he's not - he's a person who's 100% willing to hurt me in ways that no one should, and only apologetic about it when HE faces consequences. I think he genuinely lacks a capacity for empathy - it doesn't hurt him to see me cry or hear that I feel scared! It only hurts him to know that might mean he doesn't get to be with me anymore. Everything he said and did was completely focused on how HE felt and how HE was reacting to things.

So, yeah, I feel a lot of relief now - not only because he's gone, but because this affirmed to me once and for all that EVERYTHING I thought was true and I 100% did the right thing by breaking up with him. He's just not a good guy, and I tend to have a really hard time judging people so I always chalked it up to his past and the fact that he was mistreated by others, but at a certain point, I also think it just doesn't matter why someone is the way they are, especially if they don't care about changing it until it affects THEM.

I also came across this quote while I was researching yesterday that was from a social worker, who said women would tell her their husbands break things when they're angry but it's just because they're out of control and don't know what they're doing, and she would always ask them if their husbands ever break their own things, and the answer was always no - they only break their wives' things. And the social worker said, basically, this proves that they aren't out of control - they know exactly what they're doing and do it anyway. The way Greg acted today reminded me of this - he figured out a perfect way to hurt me even though we were in public, and exactly what to say to me, and he wasn't yelling or getting in my face or being obviously aggressive because he KNEW he couldn't and was actually in control of his behavior. He just hurt me (physically and emotionally) because he wanted to. Not because he had to.

Ok, sorry this is so long winded. I just really wanted to share with you guys because I feel surprisingly great right now and I honestly have no idea how that would have gone if I hadn't gotten advice from you all first, but I suspect it could have gotten pretty ugly.

I just wanted to update you guys on a post I made about me and my daughter.

After two nights at her friends she has come back home, safe but still understandably angry. We are now just starting the process of fixing what is left of our relationship. Having had a pretty distant relationship through her teenage years due to my depression and our turbulent experiences with her mother talking openly like this is challenging for both of us. Regardless, I think we are slowly getting better at it.

I have apologised to her about my overreaction and the way I handed the situation. It was immature of me to react badly to things that scared me. I have told her that I don't mind where she goes or who she sees as long as I know she is safe. She also knows now that she can call me anytime from anywhere if she doesn?t feel safe and I will pick her up and drive her home no questions asked. I offered to help her get birth control pills but she said that won?t be necessary as she is already on them and has been for quite a while. I have told her I will pay for them from now on.

After a long discussion she has agreed to be more honest with me about where she goes. As a young adult she has every right to have sex as long as she remains safe. I now understand it is none of my business and I have no right to make judgements about her. I have told her she can change her passwords so she can feel safe that I won?t track her location again as long as she is always honest about her plans in the future. We have even come to an arrangement about improving her grades and getting her extra tuition in the areas she is struggling with.

She has agreed go to family counselling with me next week in the hopes of improving our communication. I am also in the process of rethinking my own ideologies. I don?t want my own attitudes and problems to affect her life anymore. I have been close enough in some of the most important years of her life and that is something I will never be able to undo. I understand it will take a while for us to build each others trust but I am happy with the steps we are taking. 

I got a lot of mixed feedback on if should have the sex talk with her. I think because we have never had any dialogue about it before I don't really have the right to start now. I am concerned the conversation might come across as patronising as she obviously already knows quite a lot. I also really don't want to make her anymore uncomfortable unnecessary. I was wondering if I should get my sister (her aunt and friend) to have a talk to her about safe and consenting relationships, as I feel like she is more likely to listen to her?

I also am unsure of how to approach the topic of alcohol use and drugs as her mother has a history and it is a pretty sensitive topic in our family. My daughter has not been safe with drinking in the recent past but I really don?t know what boundaries I should set, if I have the right to set any? This is new to me and I want to be sure I get it right this time.

I want to say a massive thanks to everybody who replied to my original post. Your responses where extremely eye opening and helpful in letting me see the situation from my daughters perspective and through the eyes of other parents and adults. You guys enabled me to understand the huge mistakes I have made as a parent. I know I have a long way to go but I think I am moving in the right direction.

Any more advice is always welcome!

So after reading through the comments and doing some thinking by myself, I decided to tell her.

I told her about this yesterday morning. Amanda was sitting in the living room watching TV and I sat right beside her. I turned off the TV and said we needed to talk. I started talking nonsense for a couple of minutes and she asked what the hell I was talking about. Finally I got right down to it: I straight up told her I was in love with her. I went on about how much I loved her and how I know her better than anyone else. At this point, I started crying. Maybe it was the fact that I was pouring my heart out to her, but it happened. 

After I finished talking, she sat there and was silent for damn near a minute. I immediately thought the worst; she didn't love me back. 

Out of nowhere she says ""Fuck, I've been waiting for you to tell me this"". This seriously caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting this at all. Apparently she felt the same way I felt about her. She said she always liked me as a friend, but living together made her like me more than just a friend. 

I told her that we should give this a shot, since we both feel the same way. She agreed and now we're officially a couple. 

To cement that, she took my hand and led me to the bedroom. What happened next was the loudest, greatest most passionate sex I've ever had.

My husband and I have been together for five years. We have a 1 year old child (HIV negative) together and a home. Before I met my husband, I was a heroin user. I tested positive for HIV when I was 23 and I've been in treatment for the disease since. I got rid of the drug habit as well, clean since I was 25. I take my meds every day and I have been adamant about being safe. I carried my daughter to term and she has been given a clean bill of health. What I'm trying to say is that I have been very careful about transmitting my disease. 

I met my husband at the gym five years ago and we have been together since then. Before we had sex, I told him about the HIV. I insisted that we use condoms and that if he wasn't okay with the risk, that we had to break it off. We got married anyway and decided to start a family. To conceive we did IVF. We have never had sex without a condom, ever. Not even once. 

My husband gets an HIV test every six months to make sure he was healthy. After my daughter was born, he tested negative. His most recent test, he came up positive. He refused to tell me the result for over a week, and instead withdrew and became angry at me. He isn't talking to me about it, and all he does is go to work and then retreat to his man cave. I'm positive that he isn't on any medication because I haven't seen any around the house. When I try to talk to him, he gives me nasty looks and gets really snappy. 

Reddit, what do I do? He knew this was a risk when he married me. He knew that we were risking a child born with HIV when we went in for fertility treatments. Plus, HIV is not the end of the world. I've been positive for over 10 years and I take a few pills a day, but it's not like it's that big of a deal. I know that sounds really weird, but he's lived with me for years and has even commented on it. Besides the condoms and the meds, my life is 100% normal and he has seen how little of a deal this disease can be (it can be pretty awful as well, but when controlled it's almost a non-issue). 

What on earth do I say to him?

I was away for two weeks (one week was spring break, one week for a conference overseas) and had someone from my program who was staying over break cat sit my place. I paid him $20/visit and told him to visit once every two days, which was pretty fair, I thought. I'm not super close to this guy, but we're casual friends. 

I told him that if he wanted to hang out at my place and do homework, that's fine. And I told him he could treat it like it was his place as long as he didn't go in my bedroom, and that he could use my food, cook, etc. My thought was, he lives like a 20-minute drive away, I may as well make it worth his time. Plus he's constantly complaining about his neighobor downstairs in his appartment, who is always playing war video games and the landlord won't do anything about it.

Got back, cat is alive. But when the next day I went to make dinner... hooolllly shit. The freezer is fucking cleaned out.

To explain, I was raised in a family that tended to bulk buy when there were deals and freeze for a later date, and I have a taste for luxury. So when I left, I had half a dozen T-Bone steaks individually packed, a lamb leg, a frozen duck, two bags of those giant crab legs, a frozen filet of wild caught salmon... And in the fridge I had (unopened) gourmet cheeses my sister had sent to me specialty for my birthday, that I know was expensive as fuck, and I also had on the counter two bottles of wine that cost $30/piece. This is food that is *very special* to me and I eat from it maybe twice a month as a morale booster.

I'm trying to do mental math, but the steaks were probably $60-$70, the lamb $15, the duck, more than $10, the crab legs were $18/piece, the salmon wasn't the worst at maybe $25, I know the cheeses were at least $50, plus the wine. Also it's not as huge as a deal, but also a bag of pistachios are half gone.

It's like this guy literally went through my stuff, determined what was the most expensive, and ate it. OK there's still a pack of bacon unopened in my fridge!

715,dadwithguilt,Non-Romantic,3v7zog,1863,"Not much of a poster, but I have been on reddit for certain forums that pertain to my business and this seems to be a popular one, so I was hoping you might be able to help. 

Not too long ago, I and my daughter, Jane, had met up for drinks when she stopped in town and after accepting more than a few free rounds from old friends in the area, she ended up admitting to me she is in a lesbian relationship with what I had previously been told was her roommate (Naomi). At the time I had been surprised but have come to terms with the relationship. 

My relationship with Jane since this point has gone from infrequent calls to daily texts and I have never felt so included in her life. Jane introduced me to her girlfriend over skype and I have never seen her so happy. 

My problem is that, looking back, I now see how reserved Jane had always been. She's 1 of 4 children, and was always the quiet one, willing to listen but never gave her opinion on anything. To be frank, I spent much of her childhood frustrated, thinking I was raising a pushover with no personality at all. Now that she's including me to her personal facebook, I feel I have discovered a whole new person. She's now vibrant, empathetic and is going out of her way to visit more often, willing to discuss openly anything from news, movies, memories all the way to hobbies and interests she had never shared with me before.

Thanksgiving (US) is a big time for families. I guess I grew too accustomed to Jane's new behaviour, but I was stunned and confused to find that she had entirely reverted to her old self over the holiday. She never spoke unless spoken too, would gloss over questions asked of her, barely participating in anything unless coerced by her brothers into even coming out of her room. 

My worry for Jane caused me to notice more about my and my wife's extended families that I hadn't considered before. While Jane refrained from participating in conversation for the most part, I saw the most emotion in her for the entire weekend when on the first night her Uncle (My brother[64 M]) mentioned her brother [27 M] would look like a 'faggot' if he wore a particular scarf. Growing up in a military family, with my brother also in the military I had thought nothing of the comment until I heard my wife comment Jane jumped backward, almost bowling her over. 

Over the short time Jane was visiting (she only stayed for 2 nights instead of the whole weekend) there were a few other times I noticed both my family (Mostly my brother mentioned above, my father and my wife's parents) mentioning comments about gay marriage that seemed to cause Jane to shut down even further.

None of it was positive, and I'm starting to question how Jane might have felt even around me in the past. I was never particularly against homosexuality but after seeing my daughter's reactions I'm worried she has spent her whole life afraid of her own family. Perhaps even I had let slip comments in the past that drove her further away. 

Jane hasn't spoken with me since Thanksgiving (almost a week), and her girlfriend (Naomi) only sent me an email advising I give Jane some time. 

I don't know how the rest of the family might react, but I'm terrified of Jane feeling she might have to cut us all off. I love my daughter unconditionally, but I am abiding by her wish for now. No one else in my family seems to think anything is amiss, and none of them know about Jane's sexuality as far as I know (my wife included), Jane being as reserved as she'd always been, and I am finding myself more and more enraged that my own child might have been facing (hopefully unintentional?) verbal abuse her whole life that I was not aware of from the same people I had always told her would be the ones to always stand behind her. The only ones who would never betray her.

How can I help my daughter? I don't want to force my way in, but the last few months of my life were the best years I have ever had with her, and I'm worried they might be the only ones I might ever have. With Christmas now coming up as well, my family is getting gung-ho with getting everyone together again, while I'm terrified my only daughter might never step foot in our house again.

I want to respect my daughter's wishes to be left alone, but I also want her to know that I will always support her. There's no guarantee I can change our family, and while I think they only joke in jest, I am torn between wanting to sit everyone down and talk this out, but this would also likely end up outing Jane unwillingly to her extended family and I don't want to give her further reason to leave forever. How can I help when I don't know what Jane wants or how to bring up concerns to our family before Christmas that might arouse suspicion?

**Edit**: I'm putting together an email to Naomi now. I'm trying to ensure they know I'm not encroaching on their personal space but I think I'm finally managing to lay out my feelings in the rest of the message. I probably won't send it tonight, so I have time to mull it over, but I want my daughter to know that I love every part of her with all my heart. I'm also growing rather fond of Naomi at this stage, after getting over my initial anger at seeing her as a obstacle between myself and my daughter. Naomi might be just the godsend we need to mediate through this mess. Christmas be damned, I want my little girl back.

I got a call from one of my friends and he said that my ex best friend cheated on my ex GF. Not only that, but it was with a 15 (!!!!) year old girl. The girls parents happened to find out, and they're pressing charges on him. And at 2 a.m this morning, my ex GF shows up crying, begging me to take her back. I slammed the door shut on her and went back to sleep.

It was kind of a long post so I'll make a tldr of it: *Basically what had happened is my (21 male) sister, who's 21, had gone out on a girls night with my girlfriend, who's also 21, and a bunch of other girls since she's part of their friendship circle.  She came back home early, and was strangely in a bad mood, slamming doors and everything.  She told me the girls had been gossiping about relationships, and my girlfriend had started openly telling them stuff about me, in a mocking or derogatory way, and was non-candid about our relationship and sex life.*

**Okay, now for the update.** 

Warning: This is a REALLY long post

Its been a really eventful week, its had its ups and downs.  A bit chaotic at times but now things have settled, I finally have time to write this update in full.  Some of you were really supportive in the last one, some of you a bit less so but that's okay, I appreciate all your advice. Hope this update can clear things up.

After I had found out from my sister what my girlfriend had said, I was feeling pretty down.  I felt quite a blow to my perception of myself, like all this time my girlfriend had held me in a lower esteem than I thought she had.  Did she look down at me cause I was a virgin?  Did she really think I was that *bad* when we were together in bed that she thought it was worth making fun of me to her friends, or is that just something all girls do?  I hope not.  I was feeling pretty self-conscious about my penis as well.  I never thought it was abnormal, I thought the slight bend was just a feature, I didn't know its something a girl would ever be disturbed by.  I didn't even know how abnormal it was, I haven't seen that many.  Embarrassing to say, but I looked up a few pictures of penises on google and googling whether there was anything wrong with me or if its any abnormal medical condition.  I eventually realised I was overreacting about the whole thing, but still, my self esteem did take a momentary blow.

I realised I had to confront my girlfriend about it.  The more I just thought about it, the more I intensely scrutinised myself and scrutinised my actions and behaviour, the more I began to doubt my own opinion of myself.  Was I overreacting? Maybe, probably.  But I had opened up myself to my girlfriend in a way I'd done to nobody else before, I had trusted her by letting her be the first person I had ever slept with, I felt hurt and betrayed that she'd mouth off about my initial lack of sexual capabilities to her friends.  I mean everyone sucks at sex first off, right? Surely its not just me.  And even if I did, she never mentioned it, I'd rather be able to improve than just remain a joke for her to mock with her friends.  I obviously care for her very much, I wish she'd open up about these things to *me* not to others.

I was feeling really depressed and doubtless of myself, needless to say.  My first instinct was to, wrongfully, shoot the messenger.  I started harassing my sister with questions about exactly what my girlfriend had said, she didn't want to tell me, but I told her I needed to know *exactly* what it was because I was planning to confront her about it.  My sister was uncomfortable by the whole thing, but I pressed, and she repeated everything she had previously told me about what my girlfriend had said.  I asked my sister if it was okay with her if when confronting my girlfriend about it, I told my girlfriend that she was the one who had told me.  My sister sighed and relented, figuring that the girlfriend would probably assume as much anyway.

I asked her ""are you sure its right for me to confront her about this?""  Sister said ""yes, if you feel that is what you need to do.  But promise you won't stay with her just because she is your first or you feel obligated to, I've seen you hurt all day because of what she said and I don't think she deserves you back.""

And then I started lashing out at my sister, I got quite angry. I got mad at her for telling me, saying I would have been better off if she hadn't had told me.  My sister said sorry at first, and left it at that.  I kept going at it, harassing her about it and blaming it on her, she just stayed silent and visibly frustrated, eventually storming upstairs to her bedroom.  I followed her up and kept pestering her about it, ""why did you have to tell me?""  ""why did you even think I needed to know something like that"".  I definitely pushed too far, she opened the door and shouted back at me something along the lines ""oh I don't know, maybe because I love you, did you consider that you fucking idiot.  Fuck me for trying to look out for you when she clearly has no respect for you.  But no, go running to her, she's exactly what you deserve.""  She called me a fucking idiot numerous times and slammed the door on my face.  I tried to knock on the door and open it, but she had locked the door and was playing really loud music from within.  She didn't come out of her bedroom the rest of the day, and I was feeling really bad.  I felt guilty and atrocious for lashing out at her like that, I know I was 100% in the wrong. I know you're going to slice me up in the comments section for that, and go ahead, I deserve it. I was an idiot and a terrible person for attacking the one person who had my back in all of this, I wasn't thinking straight, and I'd clearly hurt the person closest to me.


I decided I had to confront my girlfriend about this.  I called her the next day, she seemed in a good mood, happy to hear me.  She said I hadn't called in a while and she'd been waiting for me to call.  We met up, went for lunch, and I kept waiting for the right time to bring it up, but I couldn't.  She asked if she could stay at my place for the afternoon before heading back home, I said sure.  Apparently her parents were having some people over that afternoon and she didn't want to be around.

We were sitting at home, and I decided to finally bring up the thing.  My sister was upstairs in her bedroom listening to music (quite loudly) and I figured she wouldn't come down or anything.  I said to my girlfriend: ""Look, I don't know how to bring this up but there's something thats really been bothering me.  Some stuff that you apparently said about me.""  I proceeded to tell her about the stuff she'd apparently said to her friends.

Her response was ""that's it? I could tell somethings been bothering you, is that really it?""  She then proceeded to dismiss it, saying she couldn't believe I was worked up about that.  I told her that she knows I care deeply about what she has to say about me, and I was really hurt by all the stuff she said, and I think an apology is in order.  She said ""fine, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.""  She said she wouldn't do it again, and she didn't know that it would affect me so much.  But then she started brushing it off again, saying it was a silly thing to be upset about, that girls talk about that sort of stuff with each other and tease their boyfriends behind their backs all the time, its just being playful.  I told her that it was hurtful to me, she did a sarcastic ""awww"" face, and seemed to be laughing at the whole thing.

Then she asked me how I knew about it any way.  I said well sometimes when you say stuff about someone in front of other people, it can likely get back to them.  Her instant response was ""It was [my sister's name], wasn't it?""  I said, ""well maybe you should have thought about that before talking about someone in front of their sister"".  She said ""I knew it, that bitch, I hate having her around anyway.  She always has to act like she's so moral and better than everyone.""

I told her ""hey thats my sister, don't talk about her that way"".  She proceeded to go on complaining about my sister, twisting the whole situation to blame it on her, saying that none of this would have happened and I would have never even found out about it if my sister hadn't told me.  I told her my sister was just looking out for me and she shouldn't hold any blame.  She said ""do you really believe that? Your sister always tries to pretend she's so moral but she loves to create drama, she enjoys stirring the pot. Why else do you think she told you?"" I told her that's not true, my sister just cared about my feelings, she should stop blaming her.  Girlfriend's response: ""If she cared about your feelings, she wouldn't have told you.""

Then the girlfriend started asking if my sister was around at home, I said she was upstairs in her room but now is probably not a good time to bring this up with her.  So my girlfriend and I stayed in the living room, eventually my sister came downstairs.  While she was coming downstairs, she was calling my name, saying there was something important she needed to talk to me about.  Then she saw me and my girlfriend were sitting together, she said ""Oh, I didn't know you were here.""  There was an extremely cold silence between them.  There was a bit of chit chat, but it was very awkward.

Then my girlfriend opened up ""What do you think gives you the right to interfere in the relationship between me and my boyfriend?""  My sister was stunned she just stared back and didn't answer, girlfriend said ""Don't act like you don't know what you did, I know you always enjoy stirring the pot.""  She started telling her that she couldn't trust her as a friend, and started accusing my sister of being a horrible friend, and she shouldn't even go to girls nights if she couldn't keep her mouth shut.

I had to intervene, I said ""that's enough"". But she didn't stop, it broke out into an open argument between the two of them, I kept trying to calm them down.  It was mostly just the girlfriend relentlessly attacking my sister, my sisters eyes swelled up with tears and she just turned to me and says ""why don't you stand up for me? she's a fucking bitch, can't you even hear what she's saying?  why are you even with her?""

At that point the girlfriend said she couldn't take it any more and had to leave.  Before she left, I said I need to speak with her.  At that point I broke up with her,  I didn't really give a reason, I just said I felt things weren't working out and its better for everyone if we end our relationship.  She was really hurt and didn't seem to understand why. I told her because of everything that had happened recently, we should stop seeing each other.  Plus the enmity between her and my sister, I didn't think I could be with her after that.  She was incredibly upset, but she seemed to understand.  My girlfriend said ""maybe we can still be friends?"" I said ""Maybe, we'll see, but we just need some time apart now."" We hugged and kissed one last time, said good bye, and she went on her way.  

My sister had disappeared, I figured she was back in her bedroom.  I went upstairs, and she was just sitting on her bed listening to music, staring at the ground.  I sat beside her and tried to comfort her, I told her I'm sorry for everything. I told her how sorry I was for lashing out at her earlier, for trying to blame things on her.  I basically told her I was incredibly sorry for everything that had happened, and I was sorry for my girlfriend's behaviour towards her just then.  She said that my girlfriend was right, that she's an idiot who always sticks her nose in everything trying to make things better but she should have just kept her mouth shut.  I told her that she had done the right thing, that I knew she was just looking out for me like any brother or sister would.  I told her I'd broken up with my girlfriend just minutes earlier, she said she thought I did the right thing.  I said I was sorry she had to endure all that and gave her a hug, asking her if there was anything I could do to thank her, she told me she just wanted to see me smile more often.

The next few days, she seemed kind of depressed and dreary, not leaving the house much.  She tried to put on a brave face and smile when she can but I knew some thing was up.  On Friday afternoon, I noticed she was sitting at home eating chips and watching cartoons tv, in old dirty clothes, it looked like she hadn't showered in a while and her hair was dirty.  I asked her what was up, she said nothing.  I told her I thought she was going to go out again with her friends on Friday to a restaurant, i.e. a ""girls night"" like she had the previous week.  She said ""not any more.""  I said why not, she responded that her friends had officially ""disinvited"" her.  My reaction was that that's horrible, how can friends do that?  She said she didn't think they were her friends any more, all of the girls she had gone with last week had stopped responding her and were ignoring her, some of them had deleted her on social media, and were basically all giving her the cold shoulder.  Apparently they really hated the fact that she had ruined the gossip of their girls night, and basically all the girls in that social group followed my girlfriend's lead, so when my girlfriend cut my sister out of her life, they followed suit and did the same. I was shocked, I couldn't believe that so-called friends would do such a thing to someone, just completely defriend them from life over one incident.  She just shrugged and didn't seem to care.  I lamented over the fact that all of this had happened to her just because she chose to stick up for me and tell me the things my girlfriend had been saying about me.  My sister just shrugged in response.  I told her I'm sorry and I felt this was partially my fault, and I said I don't understand how she can still not regret having told me all this.  She said ""why would I regret it? I don't care about them. You mean more to me, I'll find other friends after all.""  I told her that is an incredibly nice thing to say and hugged her, I sat down and asked her what she was watching, but she didn't seem very interested in it. 

She said she had had a lot of fun with them last time and she kind of felt sad that they were all having fun without her while she was stuck at home like a loser.  ""Friday nights"" were sort of a thing for her and the girls when they'd regularly go out, so it was understandable she'd feel upset that she no longer had that and she'd lost a bunch of friends. I asked her what restaurant they were going to, she told me they normally went to the same one each week.  Apparently it was a really fancy place.  I said screw it, she doesn't have to stay at home, I'll take her to somewhere even better.  At first she thought I was kidding, but I told her I was serious.  We got dressed and I drove us to this new place that I haven't been to before.  It was expensive as fuck (I spent over $200 on the two of us) but it was worth it and we had a good time, the food was excellent.  At least she wasn't feeling so down afterwards.

I still feel terrible over the way I initially handled it, I feel ashamed over my initial misdirected anger and how I was rude and careless.  Honestly, I think I feel much better off after having broken up with the girlfriend, I was expecting I'd have a period right afterwards where I feel down and regretful about it, but the more days that go by, the more sure I am that I made the right decision.

First she apologised but then tried to twist it and play it off like it was no big deal.  She got into a big fight with my sister over what had happened and many mean things were said. I broke up with my girlfriend.

Last week the girl?s (I?ll call her Mom) texted me to ask if my daughter was available for a play date the following week. We were on vacation so I told her it would probably be fine, but I?d wait and see in case anything changed when we got back. It turned out it was fine and the day we got back I texted her back confirming the play date. She responded, ?Great, I?ll make us lunch and the girls can play. You can bring your son, too. My older daughter is his age and I think they?d have fun.? Red flag #1. I don?t know about most of you, but ?can your kid come over and play? is different from, ?let?s socialize as adults over a meal and force our other two kids who don?t know each other well to hang out.? I had only agreed to the first one. I decided I was being too socially awkward and what?s the worst that could happen- let?s do lunch. I?d ask my son about coming.


Mom laid it on thick. She said they had X and X toys he could play with, they would be so happy and she just knew they?d hit it off and have a blast. My son decided he?d like to come, after all it was better than staying home and getting bullied by his big brother and being bored. 


So we go. The kids go play outside on a gorgeous day. One of the first things she tells me is that some other mom she?s talking to doesn?t communicate with her as much as she likes and that so many other parents are on a different ?speed? than she is. But not me. I am exactly her speed (whatever the fuck that means). Red flag #2. She?s so glad I?m there because adult female friendships are hard and people?s schedules are tough to coordinate, etc. which is true, but... this is 2019, lady. You don?t assume someone?s speed. I happen to be the very lowest speed that exists and you seem to be, I don?t know, higher? 


I notice she has decorated for Easter and that there are a lot of Christian decor items around. Which is okay, I don?t care, but tells me she?s someone I most likely won?t be best friends with. She serves lunch and she and her daughters sing a blessing song before they eat. My kids and I just sit awkwardly. Kids eat and leave to go play. 


Once it?s the two of us again, she starts talking about her mother and mother-in-law and possible mental illness. She starts out sort of cryptically, baiting me to ask questions to further the conversation. Whether or not she realizes it, she?s attempting to manipulate me at this point, but I could see what was happening. She is coming across as a victim of mental and emotional abuse from her family, suffers from depression and anxiety, yadda yadda, and she is fishing for support. I don?t disbelieve her and I don?t have anything else to talk about so I do the worst thing possible: relate. Oh yeah, my mom can be nasty too, I?ve struggled too, I am a woman too. 



She starts saying things like, I?m so glad you?re in my life, this was meant to be, you should join me at this mental health workshop, I?ll pick you up and we?ll go together. She is then going to pick me up and we?ll go walking around the lake together. She?s going to pick me up and take me to this special grocery store. We?re gonna go to the gym together. Final straw red flag.



I could see at this point that she had mistaken my commiserations as a rare bond between us. I began getting super vague and telling her I was busy going back to school, and we would be busy in the summer with swim team and traveling (to which she replied with her plans to meet us at the pool- damnit!). 



There were other things she said and did that were odd. Insisting her daughter wear a jacket outside despite it almost reaching 80. Completely overreacting when her deck umbrella almost tipped over. Saying her best friends were her husband and God (I really don?t mean to offend religious people, but that?s just not someone I can relate to) Telling me nobody else listens to her like I had. Telling me that she makes her family sleep in the basement during thunderstorms. 


When I came home she sent me several texts. About the workshop, some movie star she talked to once, her handyman?s phone number that I actually asked for. They all said things like I really loved having you here, and these are all exact quotes in the 3 different texts- I adore you,  all my love, hugs.  Seemed a little too intimate for someone I?d known less than. 24 hrs.



This morning she texted me at 8:30 to say she hoped my day was filled with joy and her kids already wanted mine to come back over.


 Okay, that?s all of it. I feel a bit lured and trapped. I do not want or need a friendship. But I also don?t want things to be weird between our daughters, ya know? I might be overreacting to the situation, but regardless, I really don?t want this woman in my life and I?m entitled to that, but she is taking advantage and making me an emotional hostage. I don?t know how to proceed. Advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.


TL;DR:

719,aowieurowjgsldk,Relationships,7fgfpq,1860,"Throwaway because BF knows my main. I need some help knowing what to do :(

I have been on a few academic teams in college for 4 years now. This is the second year I have qualified for nationals. Last year I had a different partner (who is female), but she graduated. Jake (my current partner) has been in the team for two years and his partner from last year (they never qualified for nationals) also graduated. Jake and I are the two best scoring people on our team this year so we are partners now. And we qualified for nationals this year.

I guess I would describe Jake as a friend, but we aren?t close. The only times we have hung out outside of practice is when he came to my 21st birthday (everyone on my teams were invited), when we have gotten coffee specifically to review our content for the team, or getting drinks after practice (which everyone over 21 comes to, so it?s not us). We don?t really text or talk outside of team-related stuff though.

My boyfriend has been supportive of everything I do up until now. I?ve been with him for a year and he has come to see me compete and has met Jake and my other teammates. He has even met up with all of us for after-practice happy hour before.

When my boyfriend learned I got invited to nationals he wasn?t as excited as I thought he would be. He asked me if any other partnership from our team qualified (normally we have at least 3 pairs going) and I said unfortunately, no. It would be just me, Jake, and our two coaches (both 50s M- paid by the school). He freaked out and we got in a huge argument. He said it wasn?t appropriate of me to take a trip across the country with a bunch of men when I?m in a relationship and that I should tell me coach I can?t go and he can fill my spot with someone else (my coach would be PISSED). He said last year when I went and the other times when I have traveled with my team are different because there was a huge group of people and more women going.

I tried to explain that I will have my own hotel room, I won?t be rooming with any of them, but he didn?t care. He also said this shouldn?t be that important to me since I went last year. I tried explaining that Jake is better than my partner last year so we actually have a good chance of ranking high. He wasn?t having it.


The part that made me storm out was when he implied that my coaches were predators and that it?s ?weird that they wanna travel alone with me like that? (DUH, no one else qualified to go!) and he said he doesn?t think it?s safe.

This is pretty gross to me considering i have known my coaches and been traveling with them since my freshman year of college. They are both father figures and mentors to me (they have kids my age for God?s sake). They are the ones who convinced me to apply to an elite grad program when i didn?t think i could get in and they have never ever don?t anything inappropriate that I know about with me or anyone else!

Are my boyfriend?s concerns valid? What should I do? He has never acted like this before and I really don?t want to lost him because i love him and we are comparable in every other way. I cried all last night about this. There is no history of lying or infidelity in our relationship. I always thought he liked Jake.


**tl;dr** boyfriend is threatening to rethink things if I go to a national competition across the country with my male partner whom I compete with and two male coaches. Despite the fact that I have traveled with all of them before, he says it?s different this time because no one else from my team is coming because no one else qualified to go. Im not really close to my partner and have no idea why my boyfriend would be upset. What should I do?

UPDATE: 

I spoke to my fianc? about this, and he had no idea that his mother was planning on this. 

I basically stated it as a ""you're not really planning on agreeing to this are you?!"" 

And I got a ""HELL NO."" in return. He basically said he doesn't even plan on visiting his father and said he needs to deal with the consequences of being an idiot. 

He's going to plan on telling his mother to fuck off. 

The end. 




Original:
So my future father in law has just had two MORE class X felonies to his record and is looking at 10-12 years in prison. 

My fianc? and I have a 6 month old daughter, and have been planning a wedding that was supposed to be in September of this year. 

My future mother in law is trying to convince my fianc? to force me into postponing the wedding and even went as far as saying that we can't have any more children until her husband is out of prison so that he doesn't miss anything. 

I feel sick thinking about waiting 10-12 more years to marry someone that I've been with for 7 years already. I DEFINITELY don't want to post pone having more children just so that he doesn't miss it. Am I insane? I mean, my daughter could be 12 by the time she sees him again, and I'm not waiting 12 more years to grow our family. 

We already have a venue, my dress, invitations have been sent, I have family flying into town. 

I may be selfish here, but I just don't feel as though we should be punished just because his father decided that being a criminal was more important than watching his first grand daughter grow up, and watching his only son get married. I just feel as though he should have been thinking of his family. My fianc? has a sister that will turning 10, and she could be 22 by the time he's out. Should she not graduate or go to college or get her license so that her dad doesn't miss it while he's serving time for his 6th felony? 

I just don't know how I'm supposed to tell my future mother in law, ""absoultely not. I will not wait 12 years to do what we've been planning for years, and to give my daughter a sibling someday.""

I wish we shared a mutual hobby or interest to discuss about, but we don't really have one. I tried to ask him to do something together like joining a club or playing some sport but he's not interested. When hanging out we often watch movies together, but we normally don't really talk about them, we just... watch. 

It's not like he doesn't love me anymore. He still cares about me and does little nice things for me. He simply does not seem to mind this issue at all. I could try to ignore it too, but then it hurts a little when I see him engage in long conversations with someone else, especially about stuffs that I know nothing about or can't understand. It sounds dumb when I keep asking and he's tired of explaining things to me... 

I don't know if I'm worrying too much. Is this something that is supposed to be dealt with by both of us, not just me? or is it not really an issue to begin with, that I'm overthinking and everyone in a relationship is like that? I just want us to connect a bit better...

722,rrtpx,Non-Romantic,3m91ww,1856,"So, my family situation is a little bit odd, so I need to explain it. My dad works about 6 hours from where we live. They have spoken about moving there, but my mom leaving her job is not an option, and we don't have enough money for her to not have a job. So I live with my mom, and my brother lives with my dad 6 hours away in the apartment my grandparents left my dad. Every other weekend my mom and I go there, while my brother and dad come here on the other weekends. It sucks, but right now that's how it is.

For the most part we are a very close family. I love my parents very much, and I consider my mom to be one of my closest friends. I can tell her anything, and we hardly ever fight. My parents have dine everything they can to keep my brother and I happy, and for the most part, we are.

So this started about 2 years ago. I have done 3 science projects for school, and I have gotten really good marks on them. When my brother was in 6th grade he needed a science project. My parents couldn't afford to buy the school material he would need to make a project, so they reused mine (they keep all of our projects and homework that have good marks). Not only did my brother get an A, the project went to the local fair and got first place. I was a little bit upset back then, but I understood why my parents did it, and I let it go. But this keeps happening. He has now entered 5 of my research papers and 2 book reports as well as a map of the world I drew. 

I didn't find out about the book reports and papers until last month when I saw one of his papers on the table and decided to read it, and thought it looked familiar. I confronted my brother and he told me that my parents said it was okay. So i talked to them and they told me that my brother has been having a really tough time in school. He doesn't learn as fast as the others, and sometimes he just needs a little help. They have edited the papers a but so that it they aren't identical, but all of the research is mine. 

I get where they are coming from, and I understand that he needs to get good grades to get scholarships for college (we don't have the money to pay for it..), but this isn't fair on several levels. 

I work really hard at school so that I can get scholarships. I want to go to college. It bugs me that someone else is benefiting from my hard work. But I also love my brother and I want him to succeed. 

But isn't it not fair on him too? He is missing out on the homework that is supposed to prepare us for college. If he can't write a proper paper, then he won't do very well after high school. 

I don't know, reddit. Am I out of line? I haven't voiced my opinions to my parents because I want to support them. But I do feel angry about it. What should I do?

I am a shy person but I'm pretty active at school so I don't feel like a total social outcast.  I play sports: basketball and softball.  Being involved in sports in a small town has actually been really great for me.  I've gotten to know a lot of people in a close way.  This includes some of the members of the boys basketball team.  They come to our games to support us and we go to theirs.  

I have never had a boyfriend.  I've not even had my first kiss.  Last year I went single to all of the dances.  It bothers me sometimes but I really just try not to think about it.  We have our winter formal dance coming up in three weeks.  

Last night after basketball I received a call from Matt.  Matt is on the boys' basketball team.  He and I have always gotten along well.  He's really well liked.  He's good looking and good at sports.  He's also nice to people generally, including people less popular than him.   He asked me to go to the winter formal.  I was totally taken off guard.  He sounded really nervous.  I said ""I'd love to go with you.""  

Something felt really off about the phone call.  He hung up.  I felt a surge of excitement that I finally had a date for a dance.  My heart was still beating fast from the phone call.  I wanted to call my friends and tell them the news but, thank God, I waited.

Matt called back after a few minutes.  He apologized and said that he had called me on a dare from his basketball teammates.  Apparently they were playing a game of truth or dare and asking me to the dance was Matt's dare.  He felt awful and apologized.  I couldn't even say anything.  I just hung up the phone and cried alone in my room.

I went to school today and everyone knew about what had happened.  My friends all wanted to know if I was ""okay.""  Apparently some of the other people on the basketball team were listening in on Matt's phone call!  They thought it was funny.  Most of them have now apologized to me but some of them still think what they did was a joke.

Today I just wanted to disappear.  I wished I could just run away and not see anyone at my school ever again.  It didn't even help to have the guys apologize.  It doesn't take back the fact that they thought of me as someone Matt would never in a million years want to actually ask out on a date.  And I said yes.  I feel like such an idiot.

Before last night I never even thought of myself as ugly.  I look in the mirror and see flaws but not some horribly ugly person who people would be embarrassed to take to a dance.  Now apparently I know what other people actually think about me.  

I don't know what to do.  I have to spend another year and a half stuck here with these people.  Some of my friends have tried to get me to tell a counselor or the basketball coach what happened.  I really don't want to.  They'll just punish the team and make this into a big deal and I'll have to live with even more people knowing that the popular boys think I'm ugly.  I haven't even told my mom.  

tl;dr A popular boy asked me out as a joke.  I fell for it.  I wish I graduated tomorrow so I could run away from this as fast as I possibly can.  

Edit:  Thank you everyone for your replies.  I have read them all and will check in tomorrow at some point to read the ones that come in after I go to bed.

724,Hathnofuryca,Infidelity,4rd3al,1853,"I (35 F) have been married 11 years but we've been together 16. My husband has some health issues so he doesn't work or drive any more. His judgement is impaired and before all that, he was mentally ill. But he was faithful and loving. Things have been strained the last two years.



We're moving out of state. He tells me a high school friend on Facebook is terminally ill. A few days later, he asks to visit her with another friend I like. It is bad timing, Sunday night, as our child has school Monday morning and he walks him to school, but he swears he'll be able to do so.


Finally, I agree. I lost my best friend to cancer...I'm soft for it. He goes. Returns at 4am via uber with a story about the party devolving due to bad elements showing up. (It was an hour away)


I take my son to the Dr cause he's too tired. I notice a funny charge on my card. An uber ride for $36 or so after the one he took. The records show it was from near our house to an hour away. He swears he had no idea what happened. 


He's spending a lot of time on the phone, texting, Facebook. He's become his friends with this terminally ill girl. I'm worried what that well do to him when we move, if she gets worse. She's always getting herself into trouble. Stories of not eating, needing to be saved. I keep refusing. 


She needs a place to stay. I cave in, though I refuse to let her two friends stay. I tell my husband she has to come after my son's therapy session.  She comes hours beforehand. Thus begins two days of things I want to forget.


I was nice to her. I didn't know. But when I woke up after the second night and there was a bed laid out on the living room floor and my husband was in my son's bed with her? I woke him up. He claims she wanted comfort after a scary movie. I didn't believe him. I told him she needed to leave. 


He finally got her an expensive uber ride. She was supposed to go see her dr, but skipped out to a friend's house. 


Mind you, during the time she was here I was working and took my son to an important doctor appointment that my husband swore he would go to. I repeatedly told my husband I was uncomfortable and asked if they had an inappropriate relationship. 


That night I got him to admit they kissed. Ok...sure. He admitted she did something to him. Finally, I asked to see his phone if there was nothing to worry about. Well, text messages were relatively clean. Not so with Facebook. That's how I found out he didn't know her before their first meeting when he brought her back to our apartment while I was asleep with my son & brought her back in after he went to school.  The things they said are burned in my brain. 


They were doing things in my apartment while my son watched cartoons and I was at work; or while we slept. I can't believe the nerve, the betrayal. He thought he could get away with it. He told her he loved her - after a few short weeks (which tells me something wrong there). 


I trashed everything I associate with her or them...blankets, his clothes, stuff she left... I have to live here. At least til the end if the month. When I think about it, I want to throw up and my chest hurts. I can't tell anyone. He took advantage of my son's disabilities and my blind spots.  (And he knew it based on reading the messages)


He is very insistent that the reason he did this is because he was seeking affection. First night it was revealed he was yelling right back at me over it. But I refuse to let him use that against me. Our issues before didn't warrant this treatment.


My instincts all told me, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying the price. We move out of state in a couple weeks. Lease is signed. I can't afford it without him. I don't know what would happen with my son without him.


So my question is: can I move forward with him? Should I? I am his caretaker, though that may have led to some of our issues in the first place. 


How do you protect yourself after such a violation? How can I tell he's sorry for what he did, not sorry he got caught?

My last post really got a lot of attention and I got a lot of helpful comments! 
Before I posted here I had actually had a brief conversation with my SO about the sleeping issue that wasn't very productive (or so I thought). 

It turns out that the night I made my first post he finally decided to start getting his daughter to sleep in her room. She didn't want to be in there at all to begin with and screamed a lot, but he stayed with her the whole night. In the morning she said she actually liked sleeping in her room! Then he told she'd have to start sleeping there by herself eventually, which she didn't like, but it's a start lol.

He also contacted her mom to talk about the sleeping issue, and she's actually 100% on the same page! So now they're going to work together to come up with a plan and reward system that will be consistent at both houses, which is awesome and should make things easier for everyone.

I thought long and hard whether I should update this, but I really wanted to thank the people who gave me so much advice when I was in a tough situation.


I posted here about a month ago and even though, I do appreciate all the advice I got, most people wrote that I should be patient for a couple more years, till I?m an adult and then leave my dad on his own so he can either swim or sink. 



Though, I can see the logic in that, I hated that scenario. Reading all the responses was beyond painful so the second I saw my dad that same day, my brain exploded and long story short, I had a massive meltdown in front of him which involved an excessive amount of yelling, swearing and tears on my part, and complete silence and shock on his. 



I said this before but my dad is not a bad person, he loves me and our relationship is very good?he?s just lazy, childish and immature. All of which he admits! But apparently never thought of them as bad traits until he saw my meltdown. He told me that he never thought I would feel so affected by his actions and he only let me do all those things because he thought I wanted to do them, ?because I?m the bright one?.



After a lot of things were said, my dad ?promised? to change. It was decided that I would still help out, do chores, and do my part as a member of our family, but from now on I won?t be alone. At first I thought this would be another empty promise (an educated guess), but somehow he was serious this time. 



We started off with some easy stuff, like going to the market. He hasn?t been to one in over a decade. It took much longer than usual but it was actually very fun. We also made a deal to take turns with the laundry and cleaning the house (if either of us breaks the deal, we have to pay the other a fine of 20?). 



Cooking will still be done primarily by me because I don?t want a food poisoning, but he promised to watch some tutorials and try cooking from time to time. So, at least when I go off to uni he won?t starve or marry the pizza delivery guy. Baby steps.



As for the taxes, I?ll keep doing them because I don?t mind it too much and chose it as one of my chores (he took loading and unloading the dishwasher so I consider myself the winner). But once I get to uni an accountant will take over because otherwise my dad will end up in jail.


Overall? though I?m still embarrassed for that tantrum, I think that getting those things off my chest was very helpful. Not only I now don?t worry as much about my dad for when I move out, but I think it actually made our relationship even better. 


So, thank you, kind strangers for all the advice. I really do appreciate it.

While there were lots of positive things Andy said about me (she's amazing, she's very fun, I would never cheat on her no matter what [brother was pitching pretty hard to have Andy hook up with a girl from his work], lots of compliments about my rock climbing), he also said called me things like ""NoBoobs McGee,""""Rat's nest hair"" and ""avocado nose."" He also went through a long conversation sort of at his brothers urging that I am far from the prettiest girl he's ever dated and sometimes he misses the dumb, big boobed types he dated in high school. 

Here's the thing, I know I'm not the best looking girl. I wish I was but I've come to terms with my appearance...well at least I thought I had until last night. But I REALLY love Andy. It's not like a first love, puppy dog thing either because I've had boyfriends and been in love before and this is very different. 

I don't know if I should or even could get over this...but I want to because nothing he said was untrue (I have no boobs, my nose is too big for my face and I spend all my spare time outside so my hair is a mess most of the time) and it was a private conversation I was never supposed to see. But it still hurts that Andy does not see me as even attractive compared to his other girlfriends. 

How do I approach this? Or even should I? I know he would feel horrible if he found I knew about this...I don't want that. But I feel like I need to clear the air somehow...should I?



   
**tl;dr**: I saw my BFs private Facebook conversation with his brother that included some very mean and negative things about my appearance. I'm not sure how to proceed. 

Edit: took most of the advice here and broke up with Andy. I can't even see strait I'm so broken hearted and crying so hard. He was very apologetic and said he didn't mean any of it but to the person who said ""can't unring a bell"" is what kept going through my head. I can't even begin to describe how sad I am rights now.

728,somehowonthesamepage,Relationships,7am006,1840,"This is my first post on Reddit and I hope I am doing this right. Please let me know if there is something I need to fix. I hope that this website can provide a more diverse range of opinions than my family and friends can.

My wife, Marge, and I were high school sweethearts and we have been married for over 25 years. We have three adult children: Lisa [29], Bart [25], and Maggie [21]. Lisa and Bart live on their own and Maggie is still in college.

Life has generally been good and we have never wanted for anything, but I would be lying if I said that the spark had not died down during the past decade. Despite this, Marge and I are still very close and we never fight with each other. I don't know if you would describe our relationship as one with romantic love or sexual intimacy, but we are both very much connected to each other and I couldn't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

Neither one of us is quite sure how this happened, but during the past 4-5 years, we have both been seeing other people. This will sound very odd to most people, but we had never made any effort to hide the fact that we were seeing another person. It was like one day, we both realized what was happening and we both started laughing about it. Marge knows that I am seeing several different men and women and I know that she has her boyfriends. We're both comfortable with this and we encourage each other to have fun and be happy.

Despite our best efforts to keep this a secret, our children found out. My wife accidentally left her email account logged in on Maggie's iPad and Maggie went through her emails and printed out all of the private conversations between Marge and her boyfriends to give to me. Maggie and I had a long talk about the situation and I explained to her that not only was I aware of her mother's actions, but that I supported her mother 100% and that it was a mutual agreement between us. After my wife confirmed that it was true, Maggie said that she understood and would support us doing whatever made us happy. Our son Bart had a similar reaction and is fine with the situation as long as we are both happy.

Unfortunately, Lisa has not been nearly as open minded as Maggie and Bart have been. Lisa has been calling my wife and crying on the phone to her, begging for her to leave me. Lisa does not believe that an open relationship can exist and she believes that I am manipulating Marge into staying with me. It has gotten to the point where my wife is tired of explaining the situation and has begun hanging up the phone whenever Lisa brings the subject up. Lisa has tried to get her siblings on her side, but neither Bart nor Maggie want anything to do with her after some of the posts she made online about us. Maggie and Lisa also got into a screaming match about the situation and Lisa banned Maggie from her house until further notice.

The holidays are coming up soon and I don't know if there's a way to fix this and make our family whole again. I've started to lose hope that Lisa will ever come around and accept the situation for what it is. I love my daughter with all my heart and I don't want to lose her over this.

I can't say that there will be an update, but should I find out anything of worth I'll be sure to post that in the future. **

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I don't want this associated with my main account at all. 

Fair warning: this is a VERY long story. You need to know everything there is to know to better understand how shitty this situation is for me. 

Several years ago, when I was 21, I met this ""fantastic"" British boy on an online game. He was in the process of finalizing his divorce to his then wife. I was super respectful when I found out the details of his relationship, even though it was coming to an end. It wasn't until after they were officially divorced and they had moved on that we began talking a bit more seriously about there being an ""us"". 

After several months of video chatting, texting, e-mails at work, etc, we decided to meet up. I drove to Florida to meet him, and everything felt like a fairy tale from then on. I honestly believed he was everything to me. We moved in together after we started dating, and after a few months of living together he expressed wanting to go ""home"", which meant the UK. We worked things out financially, and we zipped off to England where we lived with his parents for a year. During that time, he proposed. I was over the moon. I said yes, and then we had to have a come to Jesus talk about our situation. In the end, we moved back to The U.S. to complete his permanent residency, while living with my parents since he couldn't work at the time. 

However, during all of this I was very blind to what was actually happening. In the beginning, his ex-wife had contacted me about how he cheated on her, etc. Being the typical girl in a new relationship high I figured she was just bitter and angry, and he perpetuated that lie with stories about how she was crazy. You know, the usual. During the course of our relationship there were a few red flags that he was quick to have stories for. ""Oh this girl I'm chatting with? Old friend! We're just catching up!"" Of course, this was a lie, among -many- others that I found out about after the fact. 

The biggest lie he told me was near the end of our relationship. I had a best friend named Cynthia, who he had gotten close to. Just a few days before my birthday he told me they were heading out to the mall to buy me a gift. You know, just a few hours, and then he'd be back. He didn't come home until 5 AM, when I was waking up to get ready for work. He claimed the car broke down on their way home from the mall, and that they had to call our mutual friend Kim to jump start the engine. Well, the mall closed at 10 PM, and when I spoke to Kim about it she said she met up with them just past 11 PM to help out, and that they were very drunk and touchy-feely, and they she felt awkward the entire time and asked why I wasn't there. She said they both claimed that they had asked me to hang out, but I said no. 

Lo and behold, on my birthday, neither of them had a gift for me. At that point, it was pretty obvious that something had happened, and with previous evidence I was finally done with his bullshit. I gave him back the ring and informed my parents that our relationship was over. Keep in mind, I confided in my mother a lot. Growing up, we were very close, and I always went to her when I had an issue or was frustrated. She knew about everything, and I mean everything. 

I told my mother that I was contacting his parents, and I was arranging to buy his plane ticket back home to the UK. With my own money. As I saw it, he had cheated on me, and it was time to have him move out so we both could move on with our lives. At this time, I was 22 nearing 23. 

WRONG. My mother, and my father, decided to put their feet down and told me that I brought him back to America, so we needed to sort shit out. They also refused to let him move into the guest bedroom. For the next 6 months, I lived in Hell. He was verbally and emotionally abusive, didn't respect ANY of my boundaries. I worked 6 AM - 4 PM, and he was constantly up until 4-5 AM on Skype with new girls and gaming buddies being loud as hell, etc. The list goes on and on. It was awful, just take my word for it. On top of it all, I was constantly arguing with my parents about it. They saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with what was happening, and that we needed to be adults and work it out. 

Nothing changed until I finally had a nervous breakdown and told them that if he didn't go, I would move out and take my $500 in rent and utilities elsewhere. They promptly agreed to let him move into the guest bedroom. 

However, he refused to move into the other bedroom! For the next week and a half I had to argue with him about moving his things. I finally got sick of it and moved his shit myself when he was out on a date with Cynthia. (We weren't friends anymore at this point, obviously). 

Once he moved into the guest bedroom, things were okay. I was able to lock myself away in my room when I wasn't at work, and I really just poured myself into my job and doing art on the side for additional income. It was a shitty situation to be in, but I was trying to make it work. Unfortunately, it only got worse. It became clear that my parents were choosing his side over mine. He said a lot of nasty things about me to them, and I got to hear about them through them in a ""I can't believe you did this!"" way. My mother started leaving me nasty written letters under my door, and whenever I would confront her she would say everything she'd written was true- because my ex-fiance had told her. I reminded her that all of this ""information"" she was getting was coming from the mouth of a lying cheater, and she was going to take his word over mine, her own daughter? Well, she did. 

When I had managed to save up enough money I peaced out and moved out without a damn word to anyone. I had a friend several states away who was kind enough to let me rent out their spare bedroom, and that's what I rocked for a solid year before I met my current boyfriend and moved in with him. I'm in a happy, solid place in my life, and I'm almost 27. 

My ex-fiance still lives with my parents. In the time after we broke up until I moved out he didn't have a job, and thus didn't pay rent or anything else. However, he did complete his permanent residency and is allowed to work. After I moved out, I didn't speak to my parents unless it was absolutely required. I called on Christmas, New Year's, Mother's day, etc. I didn't give my parents an address, either. I was fine with cutting all ties with my family since it was clear they were going to support my jackass of a lazy ex-fiance. 

So, that was just over 3 years ago. Yes, he still lives with them. Over time, my relationship with my mother got a bit better, but she's never apologized for what happened. That's okay. I don't expect one from her, but I won't make her a priority in my life. 

The other day, I got a random Facebook message from my ex-fiance's mother asking me to message him because he had a question for me. I was hesitant at first, but unblocked him on Facebook. I asked what was up, and he asked me about my TV and papasan chair. When we were living with my parents I bought both of these things, and when I moved out I left them behind because I didn't have room in my car, and I refused to make a second trip out of fear of dealing with him or my family. He said since he had been using them since I left, he just wanted to ask if he could take them, since he was moving out of my parent's house and into his own place. I said I didn't care. Honestly, I wasn't going to be getting those things back, and I really did not give two shits if he took them without my permission. That was the extent of our conversation. 

A few hours later, I get an angry phone call from my mother as to ""why in the hell would I give him permission to take the TV and chair"". I said, to be honest, I didn't give a damn. I hadn't seen either of those things in over three years, and I wasn't that god damned attached to them. If he was going to use them, so what? It's not like I was getting any use out of them. So then she went on a tirade about how he hasn't been paying rent since May, that he's knocked up Cynthia but left her for another girl (surprising), his room is an episode of hoarders gone wrong, etc. Also, while my mother was in the nursing home (she has failing health) and my dad was visiting he threw a huge party my uncle came home to. My uncle comes over to make sure the house is okay while my mother is in the hospital or the nursing home when she has really bad episodes. I spoke to him and he said it was close to 40-50 people who trashed the house, etc. The list goes on and on. 

My mother then told me I had to deal with my ex-fiance, since it was originally my idea to bring him around. Apparently, she and my father had been trying to get him out for months but he either wasn't listening or said he would move out by a certain date then never would. I told her to call the police and have him forcibly removed since it's their house and if they're kicking him out they can escort him out and watch as he takes his things. She said no, that wouldn't do, and that I needed to handle this situation. 

This is when I absolutely lost it. I reminded her of all of the bullshit I had to go through with him and her, and how, in the end, both she and my father supported him and his words over me. They paid for everything he needed such as close and cigarettes (and those aren't cheap!), catered to every need, yet if I was a day late on my rent (because I was waiting for payday) all hell would break loose. I reminded her that he had cheated on me, and when I made it clear our relationship was over they refused to let him move out of the house, much less my room until I finally snapped and threatened to move out. I reminded her every letter she slipped under my door, of every nasty insult she flung my way because he had lied to her, etc. I said no, she made her decision when she chose him over me, and she needed to stick to her guns and get him out of the house if that's what she truly wanted now.

It sucked getting that rude with my mother, but she had to know where I stood and the position she was trying to place me in. However, it's not as easy as that. My mother is very sick. She is constantly in and out of the hospital with heart/lung issues. She lives on an oxygen tank now, and any amount of stress can trigger a whole slew of issues. Her doctor's have warned her multiple times that stress can give her a stroke, etc. I've already lost my grandmother to a stroke, so I don't want my mother to go the same way. A part of me feels responsible for the situation, since I don't want my mother to have to put up with him. 

After my conversation with my mother, I sent my ex-fiance another message. I told him that after speaking to my mother I wasn't comfortable with him taking anything, including the TV or chair. I said those things were to remain where they are, and he is not allowed to take them. I said this was my first and last message to him regarding the issue, and to resolve this as peacefully as possible with my parents. They deserve that much. To be safe, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my mother, as well. I then blocked him on Facebook again. 

So, my question is, did I handle this the right way? I feel incredibly bad that I don't want to do anything more for my parents, but at the same time I also feel that they made their bed and have to lie in it now. If anyone else has gone through something similar, what would you do? Should I call the police for them? Should I make a visit? I'm at a loss since I feel like I've done enough, but not ""enough"", if that makes any sense whatsoever. :/ Any help or advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much. 

TL;DR: Met a guy when I younger, got engaged and moved in with my parents. After he clearly cheated on me they picked his side over mine, my life was hell. I moved away and he still lives with them over 3 years later, and now my mom's expecting me to deal with him since they're trying to kick him out.

730,bouquetthrow,Non-Romantic,4w1qsu,1843,"I've been married to my husband for a year now, we dated for 3 years for that. His sister (my SIL) and I are pretty good friends. 9 months ago she got engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I happily accepted. She sent out invitations about a month later, inviting me and my husband (obviously), as well as my parents. My parents also said they would be attending. The wedding is set to be towards the end of August, so not long from now.

Well, about a month ago, my little sister got engaged, too. For the record, my sister and I have never been incredibly close. And I personally think she is far too young to be getting married, but I told her I was happy for her and fully plan on being supportive. 

That is, until I found out when the wedding was. August, literally the day before my SIL's wedding. To be clear, my SIL, my husband, and I live on the west coast. My sister and my parents live in Florida. So I could either bail on my SIL, who I said I would be in her wedding months ago, or I could go to my sister's wedding, where I'm not even in the bridal party and didn't know when her wedding was until about a week ago. Not only would airfare be pretty expensive at this point, there is no way I can be at both. Plus, my SIL's wedding is going to be this whole big thing, whereas my sister's is a small backyard wedding. 

I don't know what to do. I think my sister is being very selfish, especially considering she knew when my SIL's wedding was. But she's causing a big uproar over it and my parents are kind of torn on the issue, too. Do I bail on my SIL and go to my sister's wedding? Or do I skip it and do what I promised I would months ago?

Hi Reddit, so this is not a happy update at all. It would seem talking to Chloe (mom) about it was the worst thing I could do. 

When my mom took me out several nights ago, I told her I was sick of being left out of family events. I told her I was sick on the nick name "" pretty bastard"" that my cousins gave me. Yes because I am better looking then my male cousins they called me pretty bastard. Chloe never knew about this nick name, I thought Ally (other mom told her about it)

When Chloe got home, her and Ally (other mom, lesbian moms) got into a argument over me and the whole situation. Details I don't really want to go into because they are a bit personal were brought up. Well Chloe decided it's best they separate and takes me with her if she could not stand up with her to the family. 

My other mother Ally, well turns out she was cheating on Chloe so she had no problem with leaving the house. Ally said she needs to put her family that did so much for her first. Ally still wants to see me when everything calms down. 

As expected the extended family has cut all contact with us, blocked us on Facebook and everything. Ally has gone to go live with her new partner so it is just me and Chloe (mom) in the house now. 

So yeah, everything fell to shit pretty much. Me and Chloe will be fine financially she has a really good job

Yesterday morning, I talked to one of my sisters and told her about everything and showed her texts.  Luckily she believed me and I asked her not to tell our parents because I wanted to just tell my mom but hadn't had a moment alone with her enough to tell her.

Later that day my friend, his dad and his dads wife came over to our house and I had to walk past him for something and he put his arm around my shoulder in a ""joking"" way and when I pushed him off he acted really hurt and pretended he had no idea why I would react that way. My sister saw and heard what he was saying and confronted him about everything in front of everyone. 

Of course he denied it and said that I was the one who started flirting with him and hitting on him. Then my dad came into it and things escalated really really quickly. He and my dad were arguing and he made a comment to my dad about how it was my parents fault overall for raising a slut who thought it was okay to lead older men on and my dad hit him and they started fighting (why I didn't want to tell my dad). They threatened to press charges against my dad for it, but I'm not sure if they actually did or actually will since nothing has happened yet. 

Later last night after things had calmed down some,  my parents and I talked and I told them what all had happened and showed them the texts and they said that they would see what they could do about it. 

Ultimately I'm happy that it came out and that I won't have to deal with it anymore, but I really wished that it had t happened like that because now my dad may get arrested/go to jail and that's specifically what I was trying to avoid.

733,CrispAutumnAir,Relationships,7dszkl,1835,"My husband (39M) has worked upper mid level at several corporate companies and was educated at an Ivy league school. His friends (all from various jobs, mostly from one former job) are all at his career level or slightly above but didn?t go to Ivy Leagues (most have MBAs or other masters degrees though).

I?m (30F) a nanny and never finished college, but I will eventually and I?m not embarrassed by my job (which I enjoy) or a gold digger. I was raised fairly well off (though that fell apart in my teens and both by parents are now below the poverty line, despite their best efforts). I don?t consider myself at a lower level than my husband or his friends. 

Occasionally I hang out with them (late 30?s early 40?s, all females) by going out to dinner/drinks with my husband and his friends, or to one of their houses for a dinner party, or they come to our house for a dinner party, etc. That would all be good except that I find most of them extremely classist and, some of them fairly rude. That would be ok, but I really don?t like my husband either when he?s around them (and after he?s around them too), because he makes extremely classist remarks and is rude like them too. Its still clear that my husband shares those classist views even when his friends aren?t around, it just comes out around them because they encourage that kind of talk.  

As an example, the other night we were out with one of his friends, waiting to meet the others for dinner. One of the friends who wasn?t there yet had just started being ?stalked? by a security guard from a former workplace. The friend waiting with us kept talking about was why would the ?stalked?  friend be friends with a security guard, why did she even talk to the security/mail room people, didn?t she expect this from people like that, what could she even talk to a security guard about, etc. Then my husband started in, talking about how they had hung out with the mail room guys/security/secretaries but would never associate with them in a non group setting, why would you even talk to them, etc. They both had a mocking and superior tone. 

I found this whole conversation really gross to listen to, especially since I?d seen my husband?s group hang out many times with the mail room guys, the security, the administrative assistants, etc. and the ?blue collar? people thought they were hanging out as coworkers, but after they left my husband?s friends and him always talked like they were doing them a favor for letting them hang out, and kind of making fun of them (very gross high school behavior). 

After listening to this I told them that anyone could stalk our other friend, not just a security guard, and my husband?s friend didn?t even acknowledge what I?d said. Once the friend being stalked arrived she was adamant she would never be friends with a security guard or anyone at that level, why way he even be in her neighborhood because he makes minimum wage, etc. 

They also speak ill of their nannies frequently, fire them without warning or good reason (the reasons they give are petty, but everyone always agrees that they were sooo right to fire them, etc. when, in reality, they would actually sue if fired for the same reasons.) and act as though they are waaay below them and kind of trash, and yet brag about how well they treat their nannies (though I know that they pay about $10 per hour less than the average for the area they live, don?t give paid vacation, etc.) 

My main problem is that it seems like this attitude is simmering in my husband all the time, it just only comes out when he?s around them or talking about them.

While my original post didn?t get a ton of attention, I really appreciated everyone?s insight and advice and I thought I?d update you guys with what happened.

Mark\* and I came up with a great compromise to do weekly date nights in addition to the spontaneous activities we usually did. It went really well for several weeks, and I truly thought we?d surpassed this little blip in what was an awesome relationship.

However, this weekend he suddenly told me that he didn?t want to do this anymore. I was very confused, since we?d been able to communicate so well on our problems up until now and we were in a good place with everything. Our relationship seemed like it was getting more and more serious \- I'd met his parents, we'd talked about future plans, etc. Honestly I was pretty blindsided by his decision. We talked about it for days, and in short he?d been experiencing problems with anxiety and depression and couldn?t see a future with me, or with anyone. Our relationship had become ?too real? and he had a gut feeling of panic and anxiety and couldn?t give our relationship what it needed and deserved. The fact that we had been actively working on our relationship and reaching good compromises was likely, counterintuitively, contributing to the problem.

I think to an outside party it might seem like a cop\-out, but I understand why he did what he did. Our relationship has a history of this \- I?ve always known about his commitment anxiety and I?ve always patiently worked through it with him since I knew how well we worked together. He?s ?broken up? with me once before, but we stayed in frequent contact and continued have sex exclusively. That time, the break\-up didn't feel real \- we still talked and nothing really changed between us except the technicality of being a couple. I knew then that the problem wasn't with his feelings about me, but something nebulous and scary as a result of anxiety issues on his side. This time felt pretty similar to me. We had made plans to see each other again and continue hanging out just a few days after the initial ?break\-up.? In fact, the night he told me he wanted to stop doing this, he broke down, questioning why he couldn?t be happy with me, and wondering if he could be happy at all if not with me. I comforted him, and we wound up having sex and he slept at my place.

I processed all of that for about two days, since we needed to meet for unrelated reasons two days later. Over lunch, I realized that I really, really wanted to continue spending time with him and support him through his issues, but that I?d always be hoping for things to turn around again and for us to get back together. We had another long conversation about his feelings and why he needed to remove the aspect of responsibility and commitment between us, and I came to really understand that his issues are far deeper than what is within my power to help him with. In fact, I?d probably be enabling his avoidance of facing his commitment anxiety by continuing to be so emotionally supportive of him while not technically being ?together.? On top of that, it was so painful for me to spend time with him when I knew we still cared about each other so much.

It was really hard, but I told him that I couldn?t be a part of his life anymore. He cried, I cried, we probably just held each other sobbing for about 30 minutes \(it was VERY melodramatic haha\). When we stopped crying enough to catch our breaths for a bit, I told him that I love him. He said it back. This was the first time we?d said it to each other \(and wow, I guess it?s also the last time we will\). It?s also the first time I?d said it to anyone, but that?s neither here nor there.

Anyway, I don?t really know why I?m sharing this... I always appreciate when people update on their issues, and this sort of seems like a surprising/dramatic update to a relatively minor issue, so... if nothing, here?s some entertainment for y?all? It does feel good to write this all out... it?s helping me make sense of it in my head. I am planning to go to therapy this week to deal with all the confusion. It helps a lot to talk about it.

I?d appreciate some advice on dealing with a breakup when both people are still very much in love. I?d also really like it if someone would validate me in the decision I made, haha. Also open to insight on whether I did the right thing.

**TL;DR**: Previous issues were likely symptomatic of deeper problems that SO needed to work out on his own. We broke up, for real. I?m deeply sad and still love him but I think this is the right thing to do.

**EDIT**: Wow, I'm overwhelmed by all of this support. For those of you who have gone or are going through something similar, know that there's a stranger on the internet wishing you well!

Occasionally I've caught myself thinking about what could've been if we didn't have these issues, and I realize that it's completely irrelevant. Without our particular set of problems, it would have been a different relationship between two different people. And I wouldn't trade that, no matter how good it might've been, for the experience we actually had.

I also don't want to minimize my SO's efforts or demonize his choices. He fought against his anxiety for a really long time, and was an extremely present, supportive, and wonderful boyfriend when he did. I truly think it just got to be too much to handle, which I don't blame him for. I'm proud of him for recognizing that something needs to change.

But yeah, time to storm ahead rather than live in the past! I truly wish him the best and believe that he's going to find happiness one day.

I wish I was making this up. Last week was our birthday and our big brother [30M] gave us a matching male-female watch set. The set is probably worth around $2000 (so $1000 each).

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and this is the first time he's said something that has totally leaves me in shock. He said this was an inappropriate gift to give to siblings as matching watches are worn by couples. He thinks the appropriate thing for my big brother to do was to give me a matching male-female watch set so that me and my boyfriend can wear them together, and giving a male-female watch set to my brother too, so that he and his girlfriend can wear them together. He even says he could get half as expensive watches so that overall cost remains the same. Or just pick watches that weren't matching. 

So I asked him if he seriously thinks my brother should have given him a watch, on my birthday?! He thinks with the kind of gift that my brother gave me, that was the appropriate thing to do.

And he said he'd appreciates it if my brother and I wouldn't wear these watches to the same event. He's even upset that we posted a picture together on Facebook wearing and showing the watches. He thinks it gives a ""we're a couple vibe.""

738,herpesthrowaway2015,Non-Romantic,2yslzj,1838,"The title says it all.

My best friend, Heidi, got out of a long term relationship (6 years) about 9 months ago.  The break up is a long unneeded story,
but the tl;dr of it is that he began starting to date someone right away while still sleeping with Heidi.  After about 2 months of
this, he came to Heidi and told her that his new woman had admitted to him that she had herpes and had never told him, and 
therefore he had transmitted it to Heidi.  When she found out she was devastated.  She spent a couple of weeks sobbing
on the couch and housing bottles of wine and calling him drunk and screaming at him for ruining her life.  She shared this
information with me, but begged me to not tell any of our friends.  At this point in time, she said her love life was over
and would never be the same again.


Fast forward a few months and she is not feeling the same way.  Two things:

1) She was tested recently and came out positive.


2) She has had two outbreaks that she has told me about.


But she is still engaging in casual, unprotected sex.  And not telling these men that she has herpes, including while she is
having an outbreak.  (maybe a little TMI but she apparently only has had them on her behind.  She says this makes her ""lucky""
so she can hide them during sex)


When I've brought it up to her she tells me that it's really not that big of deal.  That a good portion of the population already
has herpes and just hasn't had an outbreak.  She says that her outbreaks are so easy to take care of and never really affect
her life that much.  I've never dealt with herpes, so I don't ever know what to say to her.  I just feel like it's really messed
up to not share ANY STD with someone you are going to be having sex with.  

When I've brought up at least using condoms, she says that she always ""intends"" on using them but then the ""heat of the moment"" 
gets to her and she just forgets.  I try to remind her how devastated she was when she first found out, to which she replies that she was just misinformed about how easy living with herpes is.

739,familysuxthrow,Personal issues,3smtqa,1832,"**Edit I went to bed and woke up to tons of replies. Thanks for all the advice and support everyone! I have decided to take Sammy on a vacation for Thanksgiving. I'm on the phone with a very helpful guy that's trying to find me a hotel room that isn't booked for that weekend. No matter what happens, I think this is going to be a tradition I build with her for the future: a relaxing weekend to ourselves while everyone else is running around buying knock off iPads.  Also, I talked to my dad briefly last night. He's pretty horrified by everything and has agreed to come over and apologize to Sammy and do it when Sammy feels up to hearing it. I have told Sammy all of this since it happened. She knows I'm choosing her over my family and that I would choose her over anyone.**

My girlfriend, Sammy, and I have been together a bit over a year. She's absolutely wonderful; smart, attractive, driven, educated, kind and goofy. She's everything I've ever wanted. And up until last week, I thought my family felt the same way.

Last week, I went to my parent's house for dinner. We get together as a family a few times a month. It's been a tradition with us for years now. Sammy usually joins us for these dinners, but had work obligations. I told my family she wouldn't be joining us that night. Halfway through dinner, I got up to go to the bathroom, and Sammy texted me that she was outside. She got off work early and came over to hang out. She would have normally walked in (which is normal) but she needed help bringing in some gifts. Sammy is leaving tomorrow for a work trip and a personal vacation to see some friends, so she won't be back until Thanksgiving. My brother and sister (twins) have their birthday next week, and my girlfriend had gifts for them. 

At this point, my family had no idea Sammy was there. We walked inside and headed to the kitchen and we overheared my family talking.

My sister was saying that she was glad my girlfriend was gone because she couldn't stand a family night being ruined by my girlfriend being annoying. My brother and other sister agreed about how annoying and awful my girlfriend is. My dad made a comment about how they should be nice to Sammy. And my mom chimed in with, ""Sammy is nice and all but I can't believe familysuxthrow likes how fat she is, he can do so much better."" My family, even my dad, agreed. And my sister piped up that I was dating down because I'm still rebounding from my last girlfriend (which was five years ago...)

I was floored. My family has always been so nice to Sammy and I've never heard them talk badly about her. I've never heard my family say mean things about anyone, to be honest.

Sammy walked into the kitchen and dumped the presents on the counter. She was crying and mumbled something about happy birthday and then took off out the door. My family looked shocked and a bit embarrassed. I asked my family what the fuck was wrong with them and didn't stick around for an answer. I went after Sammy. She was in her car, crying. Now, Sammy is usually tough but family is super important to her. She has no family, aside from an alcoholic dad that she doesn't have any contact with. My family was like her surrogate family and something she always wanted. She was overjoyed when my family welcomed her and invited her to family events. The presents she brought my sister and brother were paintings she had spent many hours working on.

And yes, she is fat. But, I prefer thick girls, always have. To me, she's gorgeous and exactly what I like. But even then, she's lost about 40 pounds since we started dating. I would love her at any weight and I'm proud of the work she's done. I have no idea what they mean about her being annoying. She comes when she's invited, usually brings baked goods or beer. She's taken my family out to dinner multiple times and is extremely generous with them. She's even become the go to babysitter for my sister and her two kids. And she helped my brother get a job in her company. She pushed really hard to get him hired and put her professional reputation on the line. She's never asked for repayment or holds it over anyone. She even does the dishes when we come over for dinner!

The thing that makes this even worse is I was planning on proposing to her in the next few months. I had planned on asking my sisters to come with me to pick out her ring.

Now, Sammy hasn't said much about it and hasn't talked to me much about this incident. She has always wanted a family and she doesn't understand why my family doesn't like her or what she's done wrong. She said she'd talk to me more when she gets back from her trip. I don't want to lose her over this. I would take her over my family. Sammy hasn't been her usual cheerful self this week and I've caught her crying more than once since this incident. I try to comfort her but she tries to play it that she's fine.

At this point, I have no idea if I even want them in my life. All of them have reached out to me with weak apologies full of justifications. I asked my mom if she had apologized to Sammy, and my mom said I could pass on the apology. 

To be fair to them, all of them do feel bad about what happened and seemed extra embarrassed about this. But no one can give me exact reasons why she's annoying or how she's ruined family nights. My dad is the only reasonable one that has offered to apologize to Sammy directly.

What do I do? I don't want to get rid of my family, but Sammy matters more to me at this point. I want Sammy to know I'm fully in her corner and I don't want her to feel guilty if I have to cut out my family.

740,Thro-ah-way,Non-Romantic,byxnql,1835,"My friend and I have both experienced child abuse. I no longer live with my abuser and am in the process of recovery by going to therapy and putting distance between us. My friend does still live with her abuser and is not doing anything for healing.

Our trauma was something we bonded over in the beginning of our friendship. It was the first time either of us were able to talk openly about it, which was very helpful. I stopped talking about it after a month or two, but was always ok with listening to my friend vent when she needed to. I always offer her advice and try to help her through it when something is going on. More often than not she doesn?t take the advice but that?s understandable considering her situation.

Over time though, it?s become harder and harder to listen to her talk about it. It?s frustrating to hear her complain about the same thing, ignore any advice, and make choices that actively hurt her. I hate to listen to her talk about her abuse and abuser also, because it?s very similar to mine. For a while it was the only thing she talked about-every day she would go ?so guess what my dad said to me last night...?

Sometimes she would send me screenshots of their conversations with no caption. I would try to comfort her and she would respond, literally, with ?...? and I wouldn?t know what to say. I stopped responding to those kinds of texts after a while. It was triggering for me to read, especially when I was dealing with the rough parts of my own therapy. I told her it was stressful for me to hear about her dad. 

Occasionally she would realize it was bothering me and send me guilty messages about what a bad friend she was, and then I would have to comfort her again. Admitting that she had upset me made her shut down. 

The other day I forgot to reply to one of her messages about her dad and she started posting about ?when people ignore your messages? on her social media. I saw the story and responded to her message, and she replied with a screenshot of my view on her story. I apologized and told her why I don?t respond right away to those messages and she said she was kidding, then updated her story with ?got em?. I felt so manipulated and stopped texting her. 

I feel like over time she?s just getting worse about it, and I?m losing my patience more.

It's been a little over a month since I made [that last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42aasw/my_36f_husband_39m_of_13_years_is_against_having/), and I want to thank all the commenters for their advice, but one commenter specifically who I feel really helped me better understand my husband's position (if not his behavior) and made confronting him about this go a lot smoother. 

>It sounds to me like he doesn't really want to deal with death as anything more than an abstract concept, something that just ""happens"", rather than something you have to accept and prepare for. If you just don't think about it, it doesn't seem real, you know? It's scary and difficult, so avoiding really thinking about it is understandable.

>That could be why he's not helping you with the care--that would force him to acknowledge the reality of the situation- and why he is hinting that a ""natural"" starvation death is ""better."" Because if the cat dies without you making the choice to help, it's just a thing that happened he has to accept, rather than any choice he had to think about.

>I think he needs to talk, really discuss, death, to try and get to the root of this fear. It's a hard situation and you seem to be dealing with it completely differently--more realistically, for one--than him, and he may seem resentful because he can't get to the place of acceptance that you have with the inevitable.

You really nailed this, /u/talienfey . I think a lot of this has to do with my mom dying, which is still very fresh for us all. Her death touched us in different ways. 

For me, it gave me a weird manic complex about having to save the cat. Looking back, that had to be unhealthy for me. I can't really stress how much of my time went into caring for the cat. And I can sit here and say my husband wouldn't help me do any of it, and it'd be partially true. But the bigger part of the truth? None of his efforts would have been 'good enough', because my standards were so unreasonably high. I didn't really want him involved, because his investment didn't match mine. I couldn't at the time I made that post, but I can admit that now. Some of the blame there is my own. 

For him, my mom's death has made him face his own mortality (he turned 40 last month), and he's been very avoidant of death. Almost angry whenever it's brought up, you know? I can't really relate to how his experience with the cat must have been, because I was too busy trying to be a hero about it. 

We were both unfairly projecting things onto the cat--for me, my mom, for him, himself. I understand that now. Only, accepting that the cat couldn't be saved and it was just his time to go? I think that was good for me. In a kind of roundabout way, it helped me better accept my mom's death. But for him, it was nothing like that. Accepting the cat's death--even having a direct hand in it--it led to a much darker place. 

But knowing all that, I was able to have a more productive conversation with him. He still didn't want to do it. He even openly confessed that he knew putting the cat down was the objectively right thing to do, and that he understood where I was coming from, but he just couldn't get past being the direct cause of his death. ""Playing God,"" he called it. He kept saying all these things about how the cat could still dream, could still lay in the sun, could still be petted and curl up in his bed, and if he died, he'd lose those things. 

I read something online, and I don't have a link and can't remember it verbatim, but it went something like, ""Animals don't think of the future and don't fondly recall the past. They only know what's happening right now."" They aren't humans, I explained to him. They don't have a concept of 'this might be better tomorrow, the medication might start working, a miracle might happen'. So it's unfair to project human concepts onto them. They don't have the ability to put the pleasure of an afternoon laying in the sunshine above suffering, because that suffering will eclipse it. 

It wasn't just one conversation. We kept it going. I told him how much how it hurt to imply I was trying to murder the cat, or that I only wanted him gone because of convenience, and he apologized. He said he felt embarrassed about reacting that way, but that it was more internally directed at himself than me. I also recruited his mom. We didn't gang up on him or anything, but I felt like it'd be helpful to have someone outside of the situation speak to him about it, and I think it was. 

About a week after I made that post, the cat began showing blood in his urine. I told my husband it was time. I wasn't willing to walk into the vet's office with only the intention of treating a trivial bladder problem. To what end? And I also wasn't willing to watch him strain to urinate and be in obvious pain. Neither was acceptable. He agreed that this was the objectively right course of action. But it was very hard on him. I made the decision on a weekend, so we had to wait for Monday morning. This gave us a couple great last days with our baby. I felt like my husband mostly avoided thinking of it until Monday morning, though. 

When it came, the cat was having a VERY rare 'good' day. This went two very different ways for us. I was glad. I thought... his last day on this earth isn't going to be awful. He ate more than usual, he was more alert than usual. He'll be ending his life on a positive note. I was relieved. But this caused my husband a lot of agony. I'm sure you can imagine. ""He's having such a good day for once, can't he just enjoy it?"" He wanted to put it off, but I said no. Because then we'd just want to put it off another day, then another day, then another day. There was never going to be a good day for it.

He couldn't come with me to have it done, which was something I completely understood and was okay with. I had another family member ready to go with me, so that I wasn't alone. 

I don't want to go into everything that happened, because it's still a bit fresh and was very upsetting, but I will say that watching my husband's last goodbye to that cat was probably the most gutting, heartbreaking thing I've ever witnessed. I've been with this man for almost 14 years. I've seen him upset, I've seen him sad, I've seen him cry. This grief was a whole new level. And if I ever had doubts about his love for that cat, then I was wrong, and I feel ashamed for ever thinking it.

We buried him together, in our back yard, beneath a shady tree.

We still have the instinct that we have a cat. We still look around our feet when we push out our computer chairs to make sure we won't run over something. I still wake up at 3am and get that moment of panic that I've missed a syringe feeding. He still closes the hallway door, even though there's nothing to keep out of the back rooms. I still wake up and expect something to meet me when I enter the living room. We still find ourselves setting aside little scraps of meat on our dinner plates, but quickly eating them instead. 

It's been very difficult, but every day gets a little better. It's probably the first time in the last 3 years we haven't had illness or death hanging like a cloud over our lives. 

Thanks again for all your advice and well wishes. They really meant a lot to me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46a4u9/i_33f_think_there_is_some_strange_things_going_on/

So, after all your comments, I pushed my husband to have us drive his son to the grandmother's house next time she asked to have him for the weekend, which was this past weekend. He didn't immediately agree to it, but eventually caved. Here's what happened:

Turns out, grandma lives in a fairly new townhouse community, typical beige walls, beige carpet, laminate cabinets type deal, you all know the kind I'm sure. 

When we got there, I said I really needed to use the bathroom. She at first was trying to tell me that there is a big 24/7 gas station a mile further down the road (told you she hates me), but I told her it was pretty emergent and I would be quick. My husband just followed me in with my stepson, and you could tell grandma was nervous. 

Ladies and gents, I was actually not as horrified as I thought I'd be. The townhouse was most certainly cluttered, but I would not call it a fire hazard. I would call it very tastelessly decorated - knick knack shelves on every wall, lots of magazines and fliers on tables, ugly ass artificial swags above every door. The kind of place that would never look ""clean"" even if it were. Just a lot of ugly crap, but nothing DIRTY dirty. 

The bathroom was messier than I would live with, but didn't seem GROSS. Lots of bottles and stuff laying out, that kind of thing. Toilet seemed normal and I peeked in the tub and it had a lot of bottles but wasn't dirty. Baseboards and study could've used a cleaning, but...I can't say mine are spotless all the time, so....idk. 

I thought it was a one bed/one bath, but turns out it is a 2 bed 1 bath. One bedroom being grandma's bedroom, the other being a sewing room/storage room. I looked in and there is certainly not room for a bed in it. Lots of boxes and totes and a big table with a sewing machine. 

I figured out the couch thing, I think. The couch is very obviously her dog's ""bed"". Her dog is this big, white, reasonably friendly creature, but it was clear the couch is it's ""spot"". There was a fleece blanket covering most of the couch and said blanket was covered in dog hair. I would not want to sit on that, nor sleep there. 

So, as far as the underwear stuff: I made a point to tell grandma that his pjs are in the bag and he needs to be wearing them, that he mentioned he doesn't wear them and we prefer he did. She was taken a little aback and kinda stumbled out an ""oh, ok"". My husband then added that since he is sleeping with her, she needs to be clothed too, as he also told us she slept in her underwear. She vehemently denied that, saying she sleeps in a ""granny gown"". 

So, it would appear that the couch is indeed not a suitable sleeping spot. My husband told grandma that next time we will be bringing a twin size air mattress for her to keep there for him. I personally wish he (my husband) had done that this time, but I am picking my battles with him, but I'm going to make damn sure he does. 

When my stepson returned home, his pjs APPEARED worn. He claimed he wore them, and I said ""ok, but you won't be in trouble if you didn't, you just need to tell me"", and he insisted he wore them. 

So, the visits aren't going to stop, my husband just does not think that is necessary. We will be providing grandma with an air mattress to keep there for my stepson, and we will be monitoring the pj situation. 

Thank you all for you comments on the original post  - I'm doing the best I can to make this situation better.

743,Teacherthrowaway1313,Non-Romantic,3pipnj,1828,"This isn't the most important or dramatic thing ever, but I'm really upset right now and I don't know what to do. 

I'm in a figure sculpting class at my community college, and I've been having a hard time. I've never worked in clay before, let alone made figure sculptures out of it. Good clay was expensive at the store she recommended we go to, and it was a large heavy block so I was under the impression we didn't need to buy more. I just smashed all of my work when we were done, I didn't like them anyway. 

There has been a piece here and there where my teacher (I'll say Mary) has asked if I want to fire them (put them in a furnace to harden them). I always said no, I need the clay from the piece because I can't afford to buy more. She assured me she has recycled clay, that I should keep some of my pieces, but I didn't want to. 

I'm also having a hard time financially. I work a job slightly above min wage, and I'm not given many hours. I'm struggling at that job, too, and that's been a great source of stress for me. 

I haven't been the biggest fan of Mary so far. She hasn't taught this class before, and for people who've never used clay in their life, I didn't feel like she explained enough about the medium, she just threw us in and got irritated when we didn't know what we were doing. When we ask for help (even if we don't ask), she shoves you aside and works on your piece. This includes tearing it out,  using tools to scratch at the clay, smashing more clay on to whatever you were working on. In my figure drawing class, the most that teacher would do was gesture with her finger what needed to be done. That's all. Mary also has given people shit for the whole semester. People ask innocent questions, and she answers in a mocking way. I was sitting in a chair once, because my clay was set up on something short, and she ranted about how we shouldn't be lazy and our sculptures aren't going to be good and we aren't good artists if we aren't standing with the model. She tried to make my sculpting stand taller, but then it was too tall, so I ended up sitting the rest of the class so I could reach my piece. Now, with the added impression that I'm lazy. She then said I should have gotten there earlier so I could get a sculpting stand that worked. 

Today, someone ran out of their clay. She has always said she has recycled clay, so I don't think anyone thought it would be a huge deal. After giving her a hard time, she went to check and came back saying she was out of recycled clay. She asked ""do your other art classes ask you to buy supplies?"" People said yes. ""Then it's no different here, you need to come to class prepared."" Which is fine, but the bag of clay I bought at the beginning of the semester was $20. I felt bad for the girl who had no clay now, but when I went to get my clay out I found that it had hardened in my locker over the weekend. I've seen her help someone whose clay hardened before, so I asked for her help. 

She gets PISSED. She goes to say something to me, stops, then starts pacing around the room. ""Are you guys adults? Like, are you? I am DONE talking to you guys about your clay, you need to grow up and sort it out yourself. You need to go buy more clay, it's $10 at the bookstore."" I never knew it was cheaper there, but I literally have no money this week. She looks at me and tells me specifically to go buy more clay. I ask, ""right now?"" She says, ""unless you're just going to sit there all day."" 

I say I literally do not have the money to go buy clay. She stops, bends over, makes a dramatic frustrated noise and paces around some more. I'm bewildered because it's not like I KNEW my clay would be hard when I came back to class. I say I'm sorry, and she comes back asking if me and the other girl can share a bag of clay. The other girl says yes, and Mary says she is going to front us the money and buy us some clay, then storms out. 

I'm just sitting there, people staring at me and I can feel myself start to tear up. I usually try to be humorous in awkward situations, but when I went to speak the only thing I could say was ""great, I just had to admit to everyone that I don't have ten fucking dollars."" I started to actually cry, so I just muttered that I should just leave, and grabbed my stuff. People said not to, that she was getting more clay, that they could give me money, but that just upset me more and I didn't want Mary to come back to me sobbing. I left. 

I realized I left my partner without someone to sculpt. I feel really bad, but I just didn't want to be around Mary anymore, and I didn't want to take anything from her. I would rather skip a day than owe her money. It also fucking sucks to know that I was once making good money at my last jobs, but I made the stupid decision of trying to find a non-seasonal job and now I'm fucking broke. I've been trying my hardest to keep up having a job and going to school, but I'm really struggling this semester and this didn't help. 

I guess my question is now what do I do? I really don't want to face her again, and silently pretend nothing happened, but I would be wasting the entire semester so far to drop the class now. My fianc? gets paid tomorrow, so if I ask him for money he will buy me more clay, but I feel shitty already asking him to pay for my share of the bills. And I don't want to come to class with a bag of new clay, because knowing her she would call me out saying I had the money all along. This is a class that I needed to get a certificate here, and as far as I know she's the only one who teaches it. What do I do?

TLDR: Teacher calls me out in front of everyone for not having clay (even though I did, it just hardened). Tells me to buy more, I have to admit that I don't have $10. She gets pissed and asks if I'm an adult, insinuates that I'm irresponsible and says she will buy me clay and I can pay her later. I get upset and leave.

744,Armita7,Non-Romantic,50tqqc,1826,"My husband owns and runs a very successful network security company. It's a small company and we employ highly skilled people. All but one of our employees have masters degrees. About a quarter have PhDs. We've been married for 6 years.

I have a very big family. Six siblings, 11 biological aunts and uncles (18 counting the spouses), 28 first cousins. The list goes on. It's not another month before someone from somewhere is looking for a job and is looking at us, thinking we can provide them. It's never been that we didn't want to put anyone to work, but nobody has ever had the right skills to even work for us.

Our family don't seem to understand what highly skilled work is like. Just a few days ago my aunt (who I love very much) was asking me if I could put her daughter's husband to work. He doesn't even have a college degree but and apparently (according to my aunt) has started to learn programming online since last month. I tried explaining to her kindly that the work we do requires a lot of relevant experience and everyone has graduate degrees and he should apply to more relevant jobs to gain experience. Her response was that he's a quick learner and he will learn everything on the job quickly. That's the mindset we're dealing with.

My husband is tired of this, and I'm kind of tired of this. This is my side of the family so I should deal with them ideally... I don't want to come off as an asshole to everyone so I listen to them and always try to explain things kindly but doing the same thing again and again is frustrating especially as things don't change and they'll say the same thing to us a couple of months later.

I don't know how we should deal with this problem?

First of all, I'd really like to thank everyone who took the time to share their stories with me and give me advice, especially those of you who found yourself in a similar situation. This was totally not a situation I ever expected to find myself in, and I'm so grateful for all of the advice everyone gave me. 

Anyway, onto the update!

So after my thread died down the other night, I reread all of the advice I was given and started writing a draft of what I wanted to say to him. I had considered editing my thread to get opinions on what I eventually typed out, but after nervously rereading it a hundred times, I finally decided that I needed to go with my gut and just send it before I chickened out. I didn't even run it by my two closest friends because I didn't want to feel unsure about what I was going to say.

Basically, I told him who I was and explained how I came to find him and what the 23andMe results said. I went on to tell him my mother's name, and following the suggestions I received in my original post, mentioned that she had died a few years ago 'before giving me an accurate story about who my father was'. 

I also said that I'd be interested in talking and getting to know him, but that this must be a big shock to him and I would understand if a relationship with me was not something he wanted, and went on to request that he at least share his family's medical history with me. 

I sent it late on Friday night, and anxiously checked my phone all day on Saturday. It's a weird feeling having spent the entire 24 years of my life literally giving no fucks at all about who my father was and then suddenly caring. It's like, before all of this, he was just this nameless, faceless person that for all intents and purposes, didn't exist. Then suddenly he had a face and a name and I could see where I got so many of my features (features that don't look anything like my mom's side and always made me feel like I didn't fit in). I suddenly found myself caring if this 50% of me wanted to know me or not. It was actually kind of scary.

I woke up this morning to several notifications on my phone. HE ANSWERED! I also had a friend request from him and an email from 23andMe letting me know that he wanted to share information with me. 

He started off by telling me a bit about himself and his life, and then went on to say that he isn't surprised or shocked to hear from me. It turns out he actually was a sperm donor! However, he went on to tell me that I'm half Jewish (my 23andMe results came back saying I'm half Ashkenazi) and the way he described it made it pretty clear that his side of the family is very in touch with their heritage. The thing is, the sperm donor paperwork that I have is from a guy who claimed to be Italian and was in medical school when he donated, and my father already started his career in something completely different. 

I've basically come to the conclusion that my mom somehow had the wrong paperwork, which is weird because she insisted my entire life that I was half Italian. 

Also, I have a half brother and half sister! He got in touch with both of them several years ago through the Donor Sibling Registry (which adds more mystery to the sperm donor situation because the registry seemed unable to find my records when I signed up several years ago). My half sister is a kindergarten teacher and my half brother plays in a rock band. He told me their names so that I could add them on Facebook as well, and he mentioned that they've all become very close. I apparently also have another half sister, who my father mentioned called the cryobank trying to get in touch with him, but she got cold feet and backed out. 

My father went on to say that he realizes how scary it must be to reach out to a biological parent that you've never met because of the fear of rejection, and then said that I wouldn't get that from him and that he's delighted to hear from me! He also told me that his 89 year old mother would be thrilled to know I exist and that she's become close with my two half siblings as well. That part made me particularly happy because I really miss my great grandma. 

I haven't actually answered him yet because I'm still taking it all in. I thought maybe typing out this update would help me do that. I was seriously bracing myself for this guy to not want anything to do with me. I sort of had this hardass only child, orphan, 'I don't need family' attitude (especially after losing my great grandma because she was the only family I was ever close to), and it turns out that I have all these people I'm related to that are so excited to get to know me. 

I'm so excited to get to know my father, grandmother, and half siblings. It's really a pretty amazing feeling and I still can't believe it because I've felt so alone for a long time and that all changed in less than 48 hours. 

I'm not really looking for any advice this time (I hope that's okay), but I had a lot of people who really wanted me to update, and I know that I always feel warm and fuzzy when I read someone else's happy update so I wanted to share this with everyone who gave me advice. Thanks again everyone. :)

&nbsp;

You were all correct, they were cheating. She was cheating on her husband, and my ex was cheating on me. For MONTHS evidently. He would go to her office on his lunches and do her on her desk, she would blow him in his car in the gym parking lot, he would sneak her into my house while I was asleep and mess around with her. Super cool. I'm more just grossed out than hurt. Like... we didn't stop being sexually active until about 2 weeks after the breakup (he had told me at one point he still loved me and had just gotten confused and wanted to work on it). So he was sleeping with her at the same time. Ick! So since I just found out I have made an appointment to get checked. Lovely. 

&nbsp;

When I found out I texted him and told him I didn't want to speak to him anymore and even though I love her like my own, I can't see his daughter anymore. I don't want my kid around him and I don't think I can see him without wanting to hit him. I also def lost my temper after finding out and said some very not nice things about their life choices... whoops. Anyways, I am in the process of cutting the last couple ties to him.

&nbsp;

Now, he met his GF at our gym. We all still go there. I have been going there for years and we all go at different times so its never been an issue. I literally haven't run in to either of them at the gym since we broke up 10 months ago. Well about a week after I found everything out, I'm at the gym and his girl comes at me. Like, she is trying hard to start something. Screaming and causing a scene, getting in my face. I just ignore her and keep doing my cardio. The owner eventually came and kicked her out. Lets just say, she doesn't go to my gym anymore, and I am in the process of filing a cease and desist for harassment. So yea..... That's about it.

Thanks to the sweet people who were helpful and understanding of my situation 6 months ago. I was in a sad place and just really needed people who weren't involved in the situation.

748,the__painter,? Locked Post ?,31j8c9,1821,"My boyfriend John is extremely difficult to buy presents for. He came from an affluent family and has a great job, and buys everything he wants whenever he wants it. I am lower income. I lost my job a few months ago and had to take on other one, which pays less, and I am struggling to pay my part of the rent and pay off my student loans. It is difficult for him to understand this most of the time.

I love to paint. My boyfriend has said my paintings are very good and that he likes them a lot. Since my income is so low, I decided to paint my boyfriend a painting for his birthday (Saturday). I researched this for months beforehand. I decided to paint a scene from his favorite game, Bioshock, with him as a Big Daddy character. I know it sounds cheesey but I honestly thought he would like it because he always said I was talented and he loves this game. I poured a ton of work into it. A week before his birthday, he had been hinting heavily at wanting a new iPhone. 

When I presented him with the painting, he asked me if this was his present and if I got him something else. I told him this was his present and that I?d worked on it for months special for him. He got upset and told me a bunch of awful things, saying that it?s a ?cheap and lazy gift? and that I was cheap in general. I was trying to diffuse the situation and I told him that I was sorry he didn?t like it but I wasn?t able to get him iPhone he wanted. He took the painting and he didn?t tear it, but he sort of bent and crinkled it, completely ruining the paint. He told me that I obviously didn?t care about what he wanted and that I was bad at budgeting and all of this ranting. 

It came out that he resented paying for groceries and utilities even though he?d agreed to this before. I told him that if he wanted to discuss that we could but this wasn?t a good reaction. He told me that I was just after him for money and that he didn?t want a ?shitty painting? when he could apparently be in a committed relationship with another girl at his workplace who makes more money. Then he told me ?but I love you? as though it was an excuse for what he said. Then he said that this girl had brought him a red velvet cake for his birthday which is his favorite cake, which I didn?t care about. I told him that I baked him a chocolate cake earlier in the week with cream cheese frosting and that is basically red velvet cake. He switched and said that she had gotten it from his favorite bakery, and some random girl knows which bakery he likes over me. I just went to bed. This morning he?s gone and so is the painting. He sent me a text saying he went out to an Easter/birthday brunch with his parents and he?ll be back soon. 

I?m not sure if I want to end the relationship, which has a ton of commitment involved. He has never acted like this before about money, and I don?t know what?s up, because he?s not telling me. I think he might be interested in this other girl or at least jealous of how much money she makes compared to me. How am I even supposed to approach this? I am already feeling very hurt about the painting and I?m not sure that?s a good place to start another argument. 

tl;dr: I painted my boyfriend a painting as a birthday present, and he ruined it because he wanted something more expensive. He resents the fact that I don?t make as much money as him and is talking about another girl. I?m not sure if I should end the relationship now.

Hi everyone. Thanks for your advice and help.

I just want to add in some points that came up in comments:

-	I did get mad at her when she stole from me the last time. I thought that being proactive by helping her get what she wants in a proper way would help, but we did have a nasty fight about it. I didn?t just shrug it off. I now realize I totally fucked that up.

-	My parents were strict when I was younger so to me strict is just the word for them. But for her they have completely checked out. I am basically her parent. My older sister not as much, but she still is involved a fair amount more than my actual parents are.

-	I do want to lock my door but it?s where the dog hangs out, and he needs to leave to pee sometimes, so I am hesitant. I did, however, decide to order a nanny cam for my bedroom. I am still considering the lock.



Last night I came home from work and my parents had gone to bed, as well as my sister, so I decided to leave it until the morning.  But I heard giggling coming from my sister?s room so I approached her and I decided to ask her about it before I talked to my parents.



Well, she full on denied it. I had printed my credit card statement and I showed it to her and she just said it wasn?t her and she didn?t do it. I am the person with the mail key (we have a community mailbox) so I was taking in her Amazon packages. They were from the Marketplace and a few of them had the prices on them so they could go through customs and those prices matched what was on my statement. My dad has a key too so he probably took in the ones I didn?t see which is why I didn?t realize it was such a big problem.


I also pointed out the Netflix charge. She said that she was using my other sister?s Netflix. Other sister lives in an area about two hours behind our time so I texted her right then and she said she doesn?t even have Netflix anymore, as it interfered too much with her doctorate work. My younger sister lied and said she was still using it.


I told her I am giving her one chance to admit it to me otherwise I?ll be talking to the parents and I will also be calling the cops. Still, she refused to admit. I even started to doubt myself. Maybe she didn?t actually do it.


I was going over all the charges and realized she?d have to have an Amazon account. I was the one who set up her email address so many years ago. If she forgot her password, my email was the recovery. I reset her password through my email.


Not only had she charged $700 in this last billing cycle, but yesterday she bought two more things off Amazon, an iTunes receipt, got a receipt from a site called The Sims Resource, and a Club Penguin membership. There were still all of the old order receipts. I reset her Amazon password and I cancelled the orders she placed. I emailed Club Penguin and Netflix and told them she was a minor and was not authorized to purchase the membership. Club Penguin was awesome and they reversed the charges for me. I guess they deal with this a lot. Netflix hasn?t responded yet.


This morning I talked to my parents. They offered to pay it for me and I told them that is not the point, I want her to learn what she did. They just dismissed it. So I told them if they don?t do something then I will not be doing their job for them anymore. I will disengage totally from my sister?s life. I told them that by choosing to ignore this, my grad school applications are immediately moving out of province.

This did upset them because my older sister had gone the same route due to their crazy behaviour so they decided to talk to her. I don?t know what they said as I had to go walk my dog but looks like there?s been 0 consequences because she looks fine and is still holed up in her room. My dad just transferred that amount to my bank account so I am assuming they just still don?t give a shit. I haven't yet paid the card. It is due August 27 so I have time.


I talked to my boyfriend and he has some friends on the police force as well as some paramedic friends who know the cops who do the DARE circuits, so he?s going to try and contact one of them. My older sister actually has a planned visit for next Tuesday, so we are trying to coordinate the potential police visit with that. 

My older sister was shocked to hear what happened and when I told her that I might do my MSc out of province she said she and her husband have room for me at their place. I could even bring my dog if I want to. So maybe that is something to consider. 


   
**tl;dr**: No one cares about what happened and I think my sister needs to see a psychologist

**UPDATE**: My boyfriend reached a cop he knows, who actually referred him to another person. He will be coming over Tuesday afternoon after my sister and brother-in-law arrive. After the cop talks to my sister my boyfriend is going to take her to the army offices which are stationed near the police headquarters. She's going to get a tour of both. We decided to do that part second because she might be more cooperative after the cop shows up. 

My sister and I are going to talk to our parents about finding her a volunteer placement. My older sister suggested that she might need some perspective -- aka not owning that game is not the end of the world -- and some hard-hitting scenarios might be the best way to get that through. 

I called one of my cousins who my younger sister really admires and she is going to come talk to my younger sister too when the cops come. Intervention style, I suppose. The cop and I talked on the phone just a few minutes ago and he said that this is not the first time he's done this. He has a lot of stuff he can say so I trust he will do that on his own. He told me that he often refers these kids to a counsellor and that if my sister seems willing he can refer us too. 

Everyone is being really helpful. I have decided to not press charges yet. A lot of you are coming down hard on my sister and she deserves it. I might show her these threads. However -- she is still my sister. She is 12. My older sister and I basically raised her. We do not want to turn her into someone with a criminal record, **even though yes, she deserves it.** Right now, we have a chance to rehabilitate her, versus deciding she's not worth it and dumping her. If I leave and she has no chance in hell with my parents, I still **will** be partly responsible if she goes the wrong way and I didn't try anything. 

It might be our house, not just her. We have extremely fucked up parents, as you guys have noted. I cannot change their ways. But if I can get her out of here, I will do so. But I can only do that if she agrees to change things. If she doesn't, then the best idea is for me to leave, because I want to have a life too.

My wife lashed out at my sister for that and is now trying to freeze her out. But I think my sister had a point.

I told my wife that I think she needs to stop doing this and now she is giving me the guilt trip for not 'supporting her' as a SAHM and not loving my daughter enough because 'don't you want her to have nice things'. Of course I do, but no child needs $250 a week spent on its wardrobe. 

Don't know what to do. I feel like if I push it too far, it will end badly, but I think this needs to stop.

751,redditaccount189499,Non-Romantic,4vopg1,1818,"This is my first time posting here but I would greatly appreciate some insight into my situation from people who are outside of it. I [32F] have been married to my Minister husband [37M] for 7 years when I found out that he had been having an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she has become pregnant. Despite his words and begging me to forgive him I have chosen to file for divorce. It was difficult because I had been married to him for so long, 7 years, and we had a 2 year courtship before we were married. He has been in my life a long time but despite him asking I could not forget the affair. He now lives with the woman he had an affair with and their child and he was removed from his job as the Minister once the affair became public. I am renting a townhouse and am working a full time job now.

The problem I am having is that many of the people in the town and in the church still see me as the Minister's wife. My husband was the Minister for 5 years and I often prayed with and supported people during difficult times, such as during the sickness or death of a loved one or during marital difficulties. Even though I have filed for divorce and am no long living with my husband, these people are still asking me to carry out these duties. I do care for these people but because I am now working full time I no longer have the time that I used to. It doesn't help that the Minister who replaced my husband is unmarried and there is no wife for them to go to in my place. I do not mind attending the odd charitable event in my spare time or visiting occasionally to have tea or pray but I cannot do this all the time like I used to. The people from the town and the church have been nothing but kind to me from the outset of this instead of encouraging me to stay with my husband, and I truly do not believe they are doing this out of malice, but I don't know what else I can do. I have gently reminded them that I am no longer the Minister's wife but they either don't listen or say things like ""I don't mind dear"". I don't want to be angry, rude or forceful because as I said they are not doing it because they are bad people. I believe they are just so used to me doing it that it's comfort for them. How can I can I kindly, gently and nicely get them to stop treating me like I am the Minister's wife? Thank you everyone for your time.

tl;dr summary: My [32F] husband [37M] was the Minister of the church for five years until he was removed because he had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F]. I have filed for divorce and the church has a new (unmarried) Minister. People still ask me to do the things I did when I was the Minister?s wife (such as charitable endeavors, visiting their sick loved ones etc.) and even though they are not malicious they don?t listen when I say no or ask them to stop, I think because they are so used to it and the new Minister is unmarried.

Hey everyone, I meant to post this yesterday but I ended up being way too busy. I confronted my mom about opening my mail, and she agreed to stop. There was no fuss, no argument, the conversation pretty much just went ""Hey mom? Can you stop opening my mail? It makes me uncomfortable."" ""Oh, okay."" She didn't really ask for an explanation so I didn't get to explain my reasoning, but I'm fine with the outcome. She also explained why she opened the letter that had my debit card in it. We use the same bank (but have separate accounts) so when she saw the bank's logo on the envelope, she assumed it was for her. Her explanation seems believable enough to me, especially since nothing in my account was altered and the card wasn't activated when I got it.
Anyways, thanks for the feedback on the original post! I really appreciated it and it probably helped prevent any kind of arguement.

753,Johndcap,Non-Romantic,4rv34n,1816,"Jenny [26F], Ada [19F].

So last year Jenny had son on Ada's 18th birthday and they share the same birthday. It wasn't urgent or anything, it was a scheduled birth. I didn't like this. I told Jenny that she shouldn't have done this and she got upset and told me that I have no right to tell her when she should deliver her son. Fair enough. 

So Jenny had her son on exactly Ada's 18th birthday. Ada was understandably upset about the whole thing. Jenny at one point told Ada that ""I hope you're not upset that we won't be celebrating your birthdays anymore"". She didn't have a birthday party although me and cousins took her out the night before her birthday. It was the least we could do for her given the situation. 

So we thought that we throw the party for Ada this year. We've been arranging it for quite a while now. However just a few days before the birthday, Jenny said that she's going to have a birthday for her son as well, on the same night. Again I suggested that she can have one one night before or after, but she insisted that the party will be on the actual birthday. She told us to reschedule or accept that people won't come to Ada's party.

Ada was again upset but there was no need for her to concede this time. So we kept the plans as they were. The birthdays were last week so two parties on the same night. Almost everyone from our family and friends came to Ada's birthday. So at Jenny's party they had only people from her boyfriend's family.

So Jenny is now extremely upset at me, Ada, others, parents, everyone because she thinks it was embarrassing for her that she didn't have anyone from her side at the party and it looked like she doesn't have anyone and people don't care about her. I think it was her own fault. We already didn't have a party for Ada last year and this year we planned/announced it weeks before she did. If she had moved the party a few days around I'm sure most people would have attended it.

Now Jenny expects us all to apologize to her and promise that from now on we won't let her down like that. I don't think anyone has anything to apologize for and I don't think that anyone has let her down. By doing things like that she's setting herself up to be let down.

So what should we do? End the terror and give her what she wants or stand firm? She's usually used to getting her way but I think this time she's going too far.

I've acquired an intern for the summer. I've had little experience with interns, she was brought over as a favor granted to someone in a higher floor than I. Office politics, she's related to a Vice President of purchasing and they want her here all summer long. My boss said ok and handed her to me. 

My job is enough for one, but not for two, and there's only so much she can learn without doing. The databases and info I deal with is confidential, and cannot be accessed without a license and security clearance. So in short, there's not a whole lot to do. As a result of this issue, I am constantly asking others in our office for random jobs that she can do. Everyone has been great so far, but I really need help addressing some problems I've seen.

This girl has absolutely no boundaries. There is no respect given to anyone in the office, regardless of position, or seniority. 

She will announce to anyone that asks that she's here by request from the VP, and sees it as leverage over others. 

She's a terrible gossip. This girl knows more about the inner workings of the company than I do with nearly 12 years in. 

She's very personal with all of our staff, making inappropriate jokes and comments that offend many. I'm constantly apologizing for this girl.  

And lastly, small as it seems, I'm chained to this girl every day. Which means bathroom breaks are together, mealtimes are taken together...and she chews with her fucking mouth open and I can't stand it anymore. 

My direct supervisor has told me that there's nothing I can do, I'm going to have to do this until late July. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can make work easier for the next month and a half? How do I correct behavior gently so as to not anger the VP, her parent?

I wanted to say ""thank you"" to everyone who replied and sent me messages. I didn't get a chance to reply to everyone, but I definitely read every response. 

Anyways, after my mom's initial freak out, I tried so hard to stay home and work it out. I knew in my heart that she was only grieving, but even then I couldn't take it anymore. Part of me felt like she was so selfish. She lost her daughter, but so did my father. I lost my sister, and Tom lost the woman he was supposed to spend the rest of his life with. 


My mother continued to be passive aggressive, to the point where I felt she was just cruel. For example, I was in the kitchen talking to my dad about whether or not we should unpack Ann's boxes. My mother turned to my father and said, ""You ought to keep an eye on (me) in case she tries to pawn off more of Ann's things"". 

As much as I loved my mother, I needed to take care of myself first. I ended up packing up a few things, and stayed at a friend's house to cool off a little bit. Before I left, my father and I agreed that we should get the family into counseling, and he said he would talk to my mother while I was away. 

A few days passed, and my mother ended up calling me. I could tell that she had been crying, and she ended up apologizing. She admitted that it was irrational to try to keep all of Ann's things, and that Tom had every right to Ann's mementos, especially since it was so personal to their relationship. She said that after I left, she realized that she was pushing away everyone around her, and that she didn't want to lose me too. 

I asked her why she was so fixated on the ring, and she said that since she saw Ann wear it everyday, she wanted to wear it as a reminder of Ann. She said she felt kind of stupid though, since it was a romantic gesture from Tom, and she really wasn't thinking clearly. 

My family has our first counseling appointment next week, and I'm hoping that it'll help us a lot. I also decided to take my mom to the store Ann's ring is from to get our own matching rings. It'll be a different style, but we're thinking of engraving Ann's name or birthday inside the band. 

I totally get that everyone is hurting from Ann's death. And my mother is normally a very rational and loving woman. I've decided to move forward from this, and forgive her. I've also been keeping in contact with Tom and trying my best to support him. I believe that he's also looking into getting some counseling as well. Thanks again to everyone who offered their love and support. 

Oh, and for the few people who messaged me accusing my mother of trying to sell Ann's ring...I'm not so sorry to report that my family might be a little crazy, but we're not that dramatic!

I never stole from them or anything like that, but I did some other fucked up stuff that just put everyone through hell emotionally and mentally. One day when I was 25 my parents sisters and my older sister's husband and my other sister's fiance sat me down and basically said, get out of our family, we've been through enough, stay away from us, this was after around 8 years of me doing really stupid things that escalated in stupidity and how much they hurt people who cared for me. I could never blame them for that.


I continued to get high for 2 more years then some things happened and I realized fuck, what am I doing, so I worked hard to get clean and stay that way, I had a couple minor relapses but eventually I stayed clean and have been that way ever since.




I'm married now, I have a good job and a 3 year old daughter. I turned my life around and I'm proud of it but I do regret everything I did in the past because my daughter isn't growing up knowing my side of the family. I tried reaching out a couple years ago and got turned away so I guess after everything they don't want me in their lives at all, despite it being more than a decade since I've seen them. Sad though because they're good people and I know my parents and sister would adore my daughter.


My sister started a job near where I work recently and we bumped into each other, I saw her a few times prior to that but was afraid of saying hi I guess. One day she saw me and I guess after the shock of her ex druggie brother wearing a nice-ish suit and looking put together wore off, she came across and said hi just as I was leaving. 



We had lunch a couple of times since then and we've kind of caught up on stuff, apparently I have several nieces and nephews, most of whom don't know I exist. My two younger sisters have been married for some years now, my eldest sister got divorced. My sister was shocked at how I turned my life around I suppose but I know she was hesitant to let me back in so I didn't push it. She knows I'm married and have a daughter and she seemed genuinely thrilled. I had lunch with her and her husband recently and at lunch he informed me that he's spoken to child services and they'll be sending someone around to check on my daughter every so often. Apparently it's okay because no hard feelings right? You know how you used to be and as an uncle he just wants to make sure nothing shady is going on. My sister seemed genuinely surprised. We were texting later on and I learnt her husband kind of calls the shots in their house, he's a good man, but strict.



But it hurts, I mean, fuck, I know I was a junkie jackass but I changed. I'm a better person now, what right do they have to even do this?


I understand where they're coming from but shit, we've seen each other a handful of times in a month after 12 years and this happens?



Apparently if things are okay, my brother in law will let me get in touch with my family again. I'm really angry. Something shady? I would never let anything happen to my daughter or my wife.



I don't even know how to take this or how to deal with these people (family)

So quite a bit happened since the original thread. 

But let me first answer a question from the last thread that I didn't see until I logged in right now: 

>So, does she have her mum's last name at the moment or the errant father's?

Her father's. Mom thought that somewhere down the line she might reconnect with her father and figured having his last name could help her with that. And if not, she could easily change it if she wished to do so.

Anyway, both me and my sister got quite the bomb dropped on us after we brought up the last name change to our mom. Turns out our parents are dating! They've actually been dating for the past year and we just never really caught onto it. I feel so clueless, but looking back, yeah, the signs were there. They didn't want to tell us anything because they were afraid what might happen if they broke it off too prematurely. So yeah, that happened. It's really weird. But also really great! 

Amanda pretty much still can't stop smiling whenever she sees our dad and absolutely loves that she can call him that to his face now. And in regards to the name change, yeah, our parents are more than fine with it, and our dad actually cried a bit when Amanda asked him if he wouldn't mind her doing that. It was a really emotional moment for us all.

I talked to STBX that night about our oldest son[5].  Our son has been asking for his Daddy and our dog, ""Loki"" since STBX moved out 3 months ago.  (STBX has only come to visit twice.)  I told him that we all missed the dog and I thought DS would adjust better if Loki came back to us.  I told him I also missed taking Loki to the hospice center twice a week (He's a therapy dog).  

He got mad, accused me of trying to guilt him into giving back our 5-year-old's dog. He reminded me that I had gotten the dog for him for Christmas.

So I offered him the trade, his grandma's diamond engagement ring and wedding ring for the dog.  He refused and accused me of holding his dead grandmother's rings for ransom and said I ""wanted to take everything"" from him, blah blah.

Yesterday, his mother came to visit my kids.  We have a very good relationship.  She's a lovely woman in a tough position.    She's mad at STBX for cheating on me while pregnant and destroying our marriage, but she has to take his side.  But still, she wants to protect her own interests too -- access to her grandchildren.  But I'm divorcing her son, not her. 

We had a lovely visit and I asked her to talk to her son about giving Loki back.  Turns out that STBX has been complaining about the dog nonstop.  (He's 4 and has very high energy.  He's used to working two days a week and getting two walks a day.)  STBX moved in with his new gf and she hates the dog.  There is no yard and she doesn't help with any of Loki's care.     

She agreed that Loki belonged with me and her grandsons, but was hesitant to get involved because STBX loves Loki too and technically the dog was a gift to him.

I told her just because something was a gift, didn't always mean the receiver should keep it.  With that, I pulled off my wedding set (her mother's) and gave them back to her.  She was teary and grateful and said she couldn't promise anything. I told her I would just appreciate her speaking to STBX about it.  

It was a gamble on my part, but she's always done right by me.  And divorcing a mama's boy does have some advantages.  

STBX dropped the Loki off an hour ago and we are all so over joyed.

So, I went in for my hair appointment despite my fear.  I got the pixie cut.  It's a bit longer and thicker than your typical pixie, but I love it so much.  It was really flattering and the stylist did a great job.  Of course, there's some maintenance involved, I'll have to buy some hair product and probably comb my hair regularly, but that's not a big deal.

I sent a picture to a couple girlfriends and my mother, and was really worried about the latter's reaction.  They all loved it, even my mother!  She thinks I look like Rachel Maddow, haha.  She probably showed my dad and sister the picture, I haven't heard from them.

My boyfriend knew I was getting the haircut and wanted to see it in person.  He LOVED it.  He thinks it's one of the best haircuts I've ever gotten and that I look feminine and beautiful.  I admit I was worried about looking feminine after this haircut, but I've never felt prettier (and I'm not a pretty lady, so this was a big step).  

I had an appointment with my therapist later that evening and she was really happy with my spur of the moment decision.  We've been trying to work on me gaining more independence and she sees this as a great step in the right direction.  I do admit that I'm pretty dependent on my parents and to a lesser extent on my boyfriend, but maybe that'll change over time, who knows.

So my husband's good friend was living with us over the summer. Since it will conceivably be the last summer he's going to be here, he often had friends and whatnot over to visit. Well, the night before he left, friend invited over a ton of his friends and his sister... who also happens to be my husbands long-term ex girlfriend. They were pretty serious, dated from when they were 15 to 19.

She immediately starts acting like nothing has changed between them- like she's still his girlfriend. Behaving cutely, asking him to do things for her, etc.  At one point, she's eating chicken wings (we ordered a ton of food, and despite this awkward mess, I hung around) and chokes a little on the spiciness. My husband offers her a paper towel, and she thanks ""her Sky-Bear"". This is when I ungraciously flip my shit. I tell her not to call him that and she needs to leave, right now. 

My husband immediately bridles and stands up for her. ""No she doesn't. She's not going anywhere."" I'm a little stunned. I have no idea what to say, but I back down, not wanting to push him. 

""Okay, she doesn't have to leave, but I'm going. And it's weird that the person in this situation who's the wife has to leave.""

""Fine."" He retorts and tells me he and his ex, and his friend are all going to the bar. And no, I'm not invited. I leave and go to bed, but before they go, I go down to use the bathroom and see him and his ex kissing. 

Mortified, I run back to bed. He joins me about three hours later, well past midnight. I ask him why he's acting the way he has been, and he admitted he just didn't like me reacting so strongly against his ex, and my tone irked him. We fell asleep, and I have no idea what to say or do. Apparently my irrational bitchiness drove my husband to kiss his ex and go out with her to a bar for a few hours without me. 

Now what the fuck do I do?

EDIT: based on all of your reactions, it gave me the courage to confront my husband. I really don't know what to say. He was completely confused. He told me such an event never happened. He hasn't talked to his ex in years, much less kissed her, and he would never think inviting her over without consulting me would be okay. I texted his friend, and he didn't remember ever doing something like this, either (inviting over a ton of people and sister). I even texted a person invited over- he kind of laughed and said he hadn't been over to our house in months. I texted him the same time I was texting husbands friend, so there was no way for them to collude. 

I am so scared.

EDIT 2: my husband came home. He was scared when he say the mess I made he thinks this is serious. He gave me a NyQuil, and I am getting ready for bed I am going to bed there's nothing more to say tonight goodnight. Thank you goodbye. I am going to give him my phone.

Mark always said he wanted to be a dad and when we had the twins we were happy.  It was also kind of perfect as a one and done- we wanted 2 or 3 kids and after the twins were born we decided that we were happy with 2.  We talked about Mark getting a vasectomy or me getting my tubes tied when the twins were toddlers but Mark said no to both because he thought we might want to have another kid when the twins were older, so I got an iud.  A couple times over the past few years, we've talked about having another baby, but we've always decided that 2 is a good number for us.

Mark is a fantastic dad, very hands on since day one.  The twins think he hung the moon and when they did a ""what I want to be when I grow up"" project at their preschool, Marie said she wanted to be her daddy when she grows up.  Mark never gets frustrated with them and has much more patience than I do.  About six months ago, I heard him talking to my brother who was about to become a dad and I heard him say ""being a dad is the first thing I've done in my life that I know I was meant to do and that I'm doing right"" and I thought in that moment that my life was as close to perfect as it could be.

On Wednesday night, Mark was packing for a business trip he has had scheduled for a few months.  He said he wanted to have a date night before he left.  We normally have 2 date nights a month on weekends but I figured he wanted to do it because he was leaving for a week and he only travels for work twice a year.  We got a sitter and went out to dinner.  At dinner, Mark blindsided me.  He said that when he gets back he's moving into an apartment he's found and signed a lease for.  He's going to be filing for divorce and has already retained a lawyer.  He said that he wants to be very fair to me in the divorce because he does still care for me but he can't stay married anymore. I was stunned and I asked him why.  He said it's because he hates everything about being a father.  He thought he wanted kids when I got pregnant but it's been horrible since the twins were born.  He said he got through the infant and toddler years by gritting his teeth and saying it was just a phase and would get better but it hasn't.  He said that he's tried to ""fake it til it's real"" but he hates every minute of fatherhood.  He said that he said all the right things and went above and beyond hoping that those feelings would pass.  I asked him why he was so opposed to getting a vasectomy or me getting my tubes tied if he hated fatherhood and he said that he had hoped he would change his mind and fall in love with his kids and want another one but that hasn't happened.  He said that he doesn't want visitation, he will pay child support and will sign over his rights if I meet someone else who wants to adopt them.  He said that in a world where the twins were never born, we would have stayed married for our whole lives but since we don't live in that world he needs to take care of himself since he's drowning being a dad. He paid the dinner bill, dropped me off at home, went and stayed in a hotel then left on his trip.

I haven't talked to him since that night.  The twins ask why they can't talk to him but I told them it's because where daddy is right now is the opposite of us and he's asleep when we're awake (that's true, where he is for work is 11 hours ahead of us).  They ask everyday when he's coming home and I say soon.  I'm meeting with a lawyer on Tuesday but I can't think straight.  My marriage and family is so important to me and I don't know what to do or think.  I've talked to Mark's mom about some prearranged childcare stuff and don't think she knows anything.  No one in my family has ever gotten a divorce, because everyone has managed to have a happy marriage.  I feel like such a failure and I don't even know what to tell my kids.  I'm so afraid that they'll resent me and I can't imagine explaining to them that their father never wants to see them again and hopes to be able to give up his rights someday.  What do I do reddit? How do I protect my kids from this? How can I convince Mark to try again with counseling and support?

TL;DR- My husband wants a divorce because he hates being a dad.

762,throwawayf0rreas0ns,Relationships,4y51p1,1806,"Hi reddit.

Throwaway because i don't want friends and co-workers that know my reddit account to know details about what i'm going through.

Me and wife have been together for 8 years, married for 5. I am Greek and she is Italian. She was the secretary of a business woman we visited with my boss 8 years ago in Italy, it was something like... love at first sight as they say. Nothing really happened between me and her back then, but we kept in touch through the internet and liked each other a lot. Things escalated and lead us to a long distance relationship. Despite the discouragement of everybody that it will not work and that we should stop wasting our time (and mostly from her parents because she is older than me and a few years with a man that wouldn't end up being with her could be an utter waste of time), we managed to endure the distance (we travelled to each other regularly) and eventually make it work. We are now living happily married in a wonderful city of northern Greece and we enjoy every bit of it.

Of course, our relationship has its ups and downs, but we never really had a big trust issue between us since the foundations of our relationship were honesty, trust, loyalty and fidelity. Before i met Valeria (my wife), i was in another long distance relationship with a Dutch woman, Larisa. I broke up with Larisa 8 months before meeting Valeria, and Valeria had full knowledge of my previous relationship and all the details - pretty much anything that happened between me and Larisa, why we broke up, what went wrong, etc etc.

Our lives with Valeria were peaceful until 3 years ago that we received a weird mail from the Netherlands. We were both surprised because we weren't really expecting anything, and the package/box had only my name written on it. After opening it we realized that it had some (not all, you'll see later) of my older belongings that i had left in the Netherlands (t-shirts that she kept everytime we met to feel me close to her while we would split again, everyday stuff, a perfume of mine, stuff like that). We were both shocked, but Valeria looked way more worried than me. She never felt comfortable hearing anything about my ex-gf, although she was the one to bring her up in the conversation. That used to happen in our first few months together. She would ask me questions about her and i could happily answer them since i was over her and it didn't hurt, but on the contrary, it hurt Valeria, but she kept getting back at it.

Fast forward to July 2016, we have had plenty of these packages delivered to us. After the first few, she started adding notes in the packages and old pictures of us when we were together. Valeria was boiling. I even told the post office to block any incoming mail from Larisa but they said it was against their policy (???) and all mail was eventually delivered to us no matter what.

During the last week of July, i had to travel for business purposes with my boss and a few colleagues to Belgium and the Netherlands. Valeria didn't say anything about me going to the Netherlands although i did expect her to. Everything went fine, nothing important to mention until last Monday.

Two days ago we received another mail, but this time the package has Valeria's name on it. Without any surprise we figure out it's from Larisa. This time it wasn't a big box though, it was just an envelope. It contained pictures of me with Larisa, and they looked really recent. The pictures were pretty intimate to be honest, but they were CLEARLY photoshopped. Some of these pictures, judging by the poses of mine, were taken from social media, but others just look totally unfamiliar to me. Needless to say Valeria was so shaken she almost fainted. After she calmed down, she looked at me furiously and a few seconds later she started crying relentlessly. I tried to explain that i did not meet Larisa and that these pictures were clearly edited. She asked me then how did Larisa know that i was in the Netherlands these specific days, which is an excellent question. The only ones that knew i would be in the Netherlands these days were my close friends, colleagues and of course my wife. Valeria said she wanted  to think, she starting packing a couple of clothes and she told me she would stay in a hotel for a couple of days. I stopped her and packed a few clothes of mine and moved to a hotel myself and have been staying there for the last 2 and a half days.

As obvious as it is, this thing is burning me on the inside. I feel shattered that things have turned like that. I feel totally devastated that my wife doesn't trust me, but i can partly undertand her, since this obsessive mailing that was perpetuating through the last few years might have finally tricked her mind. There is a great question though: How did Larisa know i was in the Netherlands these certain days? There are no chances that she mailed these intimate photoshopped pictures by coinsidence. 

So reddit, sorry for the long post, but what do i do now? How do i convince my wife that nothing has happened? Do i proceed to talk to her ... maybe today, or do i keep leaving her on her own space for as long as she needs? I think i am so stressed that i am having panic attacks all the time thinking of all the possible bad outcomes, and i am filled with unlimited anger and hate towards my ex-gf. I just want everything to be right with Valeria, i love her more than my own self and i would give the world to make her happy. I don't want to see her like that. This really feels like someone is trying to set something up on me.

**Edit/Update** : Fixed some typos. Wow, this has totally blown up, i'm stunned. I am overwhelmed by the advices and the support.
I'm trying to read every comment and reply where i feel like it is needed.
As a summary, your advice is mostly as it follows:
1) Contact a lawyer/police and see what i can do legally against Larisa, such as have a cease and desist letter sent to her or a restraining order.
2) To show the real pictures to her, the ones that were used as photoshop material.
3) Secure social media accounts, lock down stuff. Make sure no security breaches have occured and to try to make info harder to find.

So, **update** regarding legal issues:

I just contacted a good lawyer friend of mine. Well, kind of a silly move since i haven't spoken to him for years, but he gladly helped me. He told me that there is absolutely nothing illegal Larisa has done. Note to many of you: do remember that i am Greek and Larisa (the woman that is harassing me and my wife) is Dutch. There aren't even any common European union laws that we both have to obey that give me any ground to press any charges on her. She has practically done nothing wrong. And even if we were not living in different countries, it would still be hard to get a restraining order on somebody just because of some mails. So, all in all, we are powerless legally. He pretty much says that all we can do is send a legal note to her saying that any form of contact with us (mail, e-mail, phone call, text message, anything) is not desirable and that it is going to be delivered instantly back to her unopened. Also, we contacted the Hellenic Post Office and this time they took my request to not receive any mail by the said person in a more serious regard since i was accompanied by a lawyer. They said they will fulfill my desire to not receive any mail and will contact me once again the next few days for more details.

And now **more important update** regarding me and Valeria! :

I was encouraged by your comments and i decided to give my wife a call. She picked up and i was so relieved. We had a small and quick talk on how we are doing and if we are ok, and we decided that we had enough of that shit and that we should talk about everything that is bothering us. She sounded ... ok. I expected her to sound bitter or anything like that, but she sounded really ok on the phone. We arranged to meet in 1 hour and 15 minutes to our favourite place, downtown in the pedestrial area right by the sea. I was really nervous before calling but now i feel more relieved, i hope everything's going to be alright and i have a feeling it really is going to be like that. Fingers crossed i guess... I'll post an update in this post or maybe on a new ""Update"" post after we meet.

And something else. There's a few people saying that i did indeed meet Larisa and now i'm trying to cover my shit. I mean, i personally cannot see why i would make this post if i had indeed met Larisa. And if i had, why would i not tell you the truth and ask for advice, admitting that i had screwed up? Makes no sence to me, but maybe that's just me. Perhaps i'm too naive or not demonic enough to see the reason to do something like that.

Once again, thank you for your support everyone, i'll keep you posted.

**Edit2**: So something regarding Larisa. I'm glad another redditor asked me why would she harass me or if there was any reason behind that. Well, me and Larisa didn't break up very peacefully. I mean, the breakup itself was ""okay"". Mind you, it was a relationship that started with Larisa's initiative, she was the one that made the first step in everything, literally everything. After meeting a few times (we both travelled to each other), she decided that she wanted to break up with me. She didn't really want me anymore. Larisa figured that she was not really physically attracted to me (for example, she wanted me taller.. Dutch women are tall, and i wasn't tall enough for her. She was 179cm and i was 183cm but that was not enough for her. That's one of many things she didn't like about me apparently). I truly loved her, and this is why i decided to respect her decision, to accept that we are over and to move on. She didn't like that i cut contact with her though. Larisa has been suffering from anxiety. After i cut contact with her she would sent me really bitter messages saying stuff like ""I do not need you anymore. You were not needed in my life and i am strong enough by myself. You were wrong"", you get the idea. I never said or implied that she needed me anyway. Needless to say she convinved her whole family that i did say or imply those things. Well, that kept going on for a while until a point that she just stopped. The very last message was a very bitter and resentful message saying stuff like ""good luck to your next victim, i hope she realizes her mistake fast enough so that she can save that time being with a loser and coward like you"". I mean ... ok. She wasn't really friendly....

You guys had been extremely helpful, and I know I PERSONALLY like seeing happy updates. So here is mine.

However, before I get on to the update, I wanted to clarify one thing: My husband didn?t actually know ahead of time his father was sick or going to die. I don?t want to get into too many details, but he was okay, then things went downhill instantly, and then a few days later he was actually gone.

Now off to the update! First off, I took a lot of advice to heart. I?m going to do a list so I don?t talk your ear off!:

* I insisted on talking this out with my husband. I explained my concerns, grievances, and needs, and he picked up his portion right away. He has not slacked off since. He took me on a really fancy date shortly after. We have regular dates where I feel like his *wife* again.

* MIL came home, and we now had two possible babysitters.

* I brought up my issues with my therapist, and we?d utilized CBT for other issues I had, so this was a no brainer. We meet weekly. I also brought up the martyr like way I handled everything, as someone pointed out. Because they were right.

* Pysch upped my regular dose of antidepressant and added something temporary for anxiety. We meet monthly.

* I paid for temporary maid service.

* I went back in to work. That has helped a LOT. Sometimes my husband and I meet for lunch for babysitter-unnecessary dates, and other times I meet my own friends for lunch. I am excelling at work, which makes me work harder. I feel in my element. She is in daycare, and she also loves that. She has a favorite teacher already.

* I insisted sex be more ?mutual.? He was on board. When that happened, other self-care routines returned. I get my hair done, wear nicer clothes, and make sure my makeup is done.

* I dropped the hurtful friends. Not in hateful or dramatic ways, but slow fades, blaming the (admittedly true) lack of time in my life.

As a result, my husband and I feel stronger than we had in a while. I feel like an individual, a wife, AND a mom. I?m also bonding better now with her. I?m delighting in seeing new skills just click for her, and her smiles/chatting/laughs bring me joy.

Thank you, Reddit.

I've been married to my husband (27M) for two years. His dad (50sM) has always been an issue for me. At first I thought it was because I've been no contact with my own father, an abuser about whom I could write pages about the shit he put me and my family through, but I slowly realized that he's an asshole in his own right. Racist, ignorant, and a convicted wife-beater to boot. Recovering alcoholic, etc. I get along *very* well with my MIL(50sF), though, and consider her a dear friend.

We had our first child this last month. My daughter is perfect. From the moment I found out about her, she became my heart. My husband and I were absolutely and completely besotted, even before she was born. No one except our moms knew for the first three months (I have a history of pregnancy loss) and he took this personally, citing my ""issues with men"" to my DH. Even to the point of my FIL telling my husband that the ""real reason"" we didn't want to find out about the sex of the baby because if it was a boy I'd probably abort (side note- I'm extremely close to my stepdad, brother and many other male relatives and have no issue with men, just abusers regardless of sex). 

The pregnancy was hard on me. I didn't gain enough weight, was on and off bed rest due to cramping and bleeding. Ended up going to 43 weeks, which was a miracle in and of itself, and was cleared for a natural birth. Of course, FIL bitched about it, said that if a c-section was good enough for MIL (who has major medical issues leading to my DH being her only child and a planned c-section leading to a hysterectomy) it should be good enough for me, that this baby would die (which hurt like hell because of my previous losses, about which he knew), that the longer I stayed pregnant the fatter I'd get (note- I was underweight my whole pregnancy) and the less attracted to me my husband would be, and a million other nasties. 

I finally went into labor three weeks ago. Unmedicated, in a hospital but with a midwife. Was long and horrible and one of the best choices I've ever made. About 13 hours in, FIL and MIL decide to burst in. NOPE. I've told the hospital not to let anyone in (I don't want my own father and stepmother even knowing about my daughter let alone coming to the birth). 

I flip a shit. Maybe it was being 13 hours into labor with an 11lb baby. Maybe it was just the piles of horrible abusive shit he's been shoveling onto me and my husband and my MIL for as long as any of us have known him. But I completely lose it. Tell him to get his abusive ass out, tell him that nothing is coming out of my ladybits with him in there so if he wants to meet his grandbaby, he needs to scram. Basically the sort of yelling you'd expect from a woman 13 hours into labor who is faced with someone she deeply dislikes but tolerates for her husband's sake.

He turns purple and goes at me, hand raised, before he realizes where he is. My husband grabs him, has him in a chokehold (husband has a good 50lbs and 6in on him). I think my husband would've killed him if hospital security hadn't taken him out. With just my husband, mother and MIL in the room, the baby came within two more hours, after interventions- the stress from the encounter caused my daughter to go into distress, and myself to completely panic and shut down. The opposite of what was needed in labor, in short.

So... what do I do now? What do we do now? I want to go no contact, but that would mean losing contact with my MIL with whom I get along well, and my husband  losing his parents, plus my daughter never knowing any grandparents but my mom due to my dad not being in my life. What do I do?

TL;DR: FIL is an abusive ass and took a swing at me **while I was in labor**. Don't know where to go from here. 

EDIT: Fixed some statements to make it obvious that no, I would not abort due to the sex of the baby.

In my previous post, I said how these two drunk guys (Bill and Chris) in my dorm were screaming that they were going to fight each other from 3 to 3:30 AM the night before I had to take a midterm. A couple people tried to get them to settle down since they were keeping the whole floor up, but even when I threatened to call the police they wouldn't stop. I went to my room, and called the police on them, which resulted in them both being banned from entering the dorm building again (I think they're temporarily in hotels now). Also, about half my floor got in trouble for underage drinking when the police came. My roommates (Jess and Lisa) and all the people on my floor were really angry with me. 

So, onto the update. After the fight on Thursday night, I spent Friday and Saturday nights sleeping on a friends sofa, and spent the days with friends and doing activities with clubs I'm involved in. I was hoping to avoid most of the fallout from reporting the fight.

I finally went back to the dorm on Sunday and talked to my roommates. Lisa thought I had overreacted when I called the police, but wasn't as upset about the events as she had been on Friday. Jess, whose boyfriend had gotten in trouble because of me, was still angry with me but still gave me a chance to tell my side of the story.

I told them that I honestly hadn't fully thought through the consequences of calling the police, I had done it knowing that the two guys arguing would be in trouble, but I never intended for our other floor mates to get in trouble.  I didn't mind that people liked to go out and drink, and had even thought that I had been as fair as I could have been to them, by giving everyone an advance warning I'd be calling the police. I actually do regret getting people who hadn't done anything worse than trying to have a fun night out in trouble. My roommates, who hadn't been there at the time hadn't known I'd warned everyone first, and were surprised and happy to hear that.

However, I also told them that I didn't regret reporting the guys who were fighting. I said, without going into details, that I'd unfortunately had to live with people in my family who could not control their anger in the past. I told them that I wouldn't put up with living with violent disrespectful people again. I didn't think that this fight would be the last issue with Bill and Chris, especially since I'd already seen one of them, Bill, acting like a dick all the time. (A recent example was when he snuck up on my roommate Jess and I watching a movie in the lounge and tipped our chairs back so we thought we'd fall on our heads.) I didn't know the other guy, Chris, personally, but from what I saw of him on Thursday night, he seemed to be a pretty violent guy too. 

I said that I knew that most of the floor was upset with what I did, but I hoped they'd realize I wasn't thinking about ratting them all out at the time. I was frustrated with being kept up late before the midterm, and also, largely because of my past experiences with angry drunks in my family, I had very little patience or respect for people who can't control themselves.

After all that, Lisa told me that she understood why I did what I did, though she still thinks my actions escalated events way too much. Jess, however, told me that just because I had a ""chip on my shoulder"" because of my family history doesn't mean I should have called the cops. I think bringing up my own dislike for people who drink too much and can't control themselves made her think I was taking my own issues out on people who hadn't personally did anything to me. 

A bunch of you in the comments wondered what was going on with the RA also, so I'll explain that. My floor's RA, Nick, was not on duty that night and was actually at his girlfriend's place. The two RAs who were on duty were on the lower floors, asleep, and didn't hear the commotion up on the 10th floor. All things considered, the RAs in my building have been kind of hands-off. I've only talked to my RA Nick a couple times: moving in, and the occasional room check. So, it didn't even occur to me to go look for an RA. 

I did follow the advice I saw a lot in the comments of talking to my RD, Allison. (RD = Residence hall director) She already knew what had gone on; she'd come up to the floor when the police arrived, however she hadn't known it was me that called them. I asked her whether I'd have the option of moving rooms if there were ongoing issues with people on my floor, although I knew that was unlikely to happen. She told me that it is a difficult process to move rooms, you have to prove you have a valid reason to be unable to stay where you are living. Before moving, all other methods to resolve the conflict must be attempted. (From what I've herd, it's a LOT of sitting around and hashing out your issues when a RA is present. Usually when that is complete, the conflict is deemed to have been handled, and the request to move is denied. At least, that is what I have heard from others who have tried to move, such as a friend who was living with a guy who was extremely unhygienic and reeked so much I couldn't stand being in the room.) Also, the school's on-campus housing is over capacity already, with students even having to live in what were previously lounges and common areas, since there are not enough proper dorm rooms. 

Allison did tell me that if there were any further conflicts, to go report them to her or my RA. I didn't mention my conversation (The one I described above) with my roommates for several reasons. Firstly, I already have enough of a reputation of ratting people out instead of dealing with things myself, and I thought it would be better to let my roommates think about what we'd talked about for a bit before dragging them into some kind of mandatory ""conflict resolution"" meeting. I also told them a little more about my past then I want to talk about with Allison or anyone else for that matter. If there is any serious conflict, I will go to her, but for now, I have not.

In the 3 days since I returned to the dorm, I have seen a bunch of my floormates around, and for the most part, they have either ignored me or given me dirty looks. Probably stuff that will blow over in time. One notable exception was when I was doing my laundry and a girl I didn't know too well named Lea came into the room. She had gotten in trouble for drinking that night, so I was surprised when she told me ""Thanks for getting Chris banned from the building."" She must have seen how surprised I looked, and she went on to explain how much of a ""creepy fucker"" he was. When the floor would go out partying he'd always be trying to grind on her or pick up really drunk girls and stuff like that. She told me that both he and Bill had often ""started shit when we're going out, always arguing with someone random"" and that a lot of the girls on the floor, while they were upset about getting in trouble themselves, were glad to see Chris and Bill gone. Not all the guys felt the same way, some were pissed about their ""bros"" getting fucked over for getting a little rowdy. Overall, it seems like my decision to report Bill and Chris wasn't quite as unpopular as I thought. 

Also, there haven't been any issues with my roommates since our talk. We haven't hung out like we used to, but they've both been civil to me and I've done my best to keep busy with other things than hanging out in our room for the last few days.

I haven't seen Chris or Bill, but I'm not surprised. It's a big campus, and they're apparently both in hotels off campus.

TLDR - I called the police on a fight in my dorm, therefore upsetting most of my floormates. I then stayed away from the dorm for several days before coming back to talk with my roommates. Both think I overreacted, calling the police, but have been civil towards me since. I talked to my RD, who confirmed that it's very difficult it is to get permission to switch rooms. Also, I talked to a girl who knew the guys involved in the fight. She told me that a surprising amount of people would be glad to see them gone. Now I'm waiting for all this to hopefully blow over.

766,NeverAwise1,Personal issues,70nvvv,1796,"I love this girl immensely and I think that's why I feel like she can not only do better but deserves better. We've been together 4 years and in the beginning it was mostly about sex. We met online. She'd never been with a native dude and I'd never been with a white girl. 

It didn't take long at all for me to fall for her. She's funny and witty and so smart. Way smarter than I could ever dream to be. It doesn't hurt that she's incredibly beautiful either. 10/10 in my books. She's just a wonderful person inside and out.

I struggled a lot before I met her. I lived on the reserve. Alcoholism is rampant there and I was not an exception. My ex and I even lost custody of our son and daughter because we couldn't keep our shit together. Currently my kids are [11M and 9F]. I wasn't even working when I met my gf since I was in such a bad place.

I started drinking very young 13, maybe 14 and it feels like I just never stopped. I tried quitting around the birth of my first born at least half a million times. I'd only make it a few days until the detox was absolutely unbearable and I'd give into the craving. I wanted so badly to change for him, to be a good daddy but ultimately I failed him miserably. I failed my daughter too.

I don't know what my gf saw in me when she met me. I was a failure of a human being. She was the first person in my whole entire life to call me on my bullshit though. She told me I was a deadbeat dad. She told me my drinking was a huge issue. She said countless hurtful things, yet they were all very true. I was exactly the person she said I was.

It was barely a month into meeting her that I showed up at her house incredibly drunk and had a full on meltdown. I just cried like I'd never cried before and I basically admitted to all the terrible things she said I was. I told her I didn't want to be that person. I didn't want to be me.

It's all a vague and blurry memory but I can remember her just hugging me and crying with me and I don't think I'd ever felt that kind of compassion before her. I don't think I ever truly felt cared about in the way she cared about me. 

The next morning she asked if I wanted help. She said she'd figure everything out for me if I wanted help. I did want help. 

She got me into detox which was a fucking nightmare. Then I went to rehab where she visited as often as they allowed. Then instead of going back home to the reserve she asked if I wanted to stay with her. She along with my therapist didn't think going  back home would be at all good for my sobriety. 

I've lived with her ever since. She even helped me get a job, albeit for her dad's company. If anything that gave me even more incentive not to fuck it up since I wanted to make a good impression. After that I was allowed a lot more visitation with my kids and then about a year into my sobriety I was given custody back. Again my gf went above and beyond by letting them move into her home.

She has been an amazing mother figure to them over the last three years of us all living together. The kids love her. I love her. Her family has been great with the kids too. Never treated them like outsiders. They've been given the best Christmases and birthdays because of these people. I've never felt anything but warmth and acceptance from all of them which I know deep down I don't deserve.

I want to marry her, but that's where all the doubt starts to come into play. She given me so much but I feel like I have nothing to offer in return. She says she loves me more than anything in the whole entire world. I don't see how. I feel gross most of the time. I can't stand thinking about who I was, how I neglected and lost my kids just so I could get drunk.

I was a truly horrible person and it disgusts me. I feel like a joke. I feel like a stereotype. I feel like the whole lot of them would be better off without me. 

I know my gf would say yes if I proposed. As badly as I want to I just feel like a woman as wonderful as her deserves a man just as great. I don't want her to settle for me. I don't want her to look back in 10 years and wish she never met me. I wish I could have as big and amazing impact on her life as she did mine, but instead I feel like I can only bring her down.

I know we get looks sometimes when we're out too. I know people wonder why she's with someone like me. Her friends were always very vocal about me being a huge mistake. That I'll only cause trouble in her life/that I'm using her. To this day they say she could do better. They're not wrong about the better part.

Sometimes I can't help but wish I was born white. Things would've been so much different. I feel like at least that way when people looked at me they wouldn't automatically assume I'm up to no good. They wouldn't see us together and wonder what a pretty girl like her is doing with a guy like me. I feel like no matter how much I try to change my life my skin colour is a reflection of how shitty I once was.

What do I do Reddit? This is probably above your pay grade isn't it? How I do I feel good enough? Be good enough? Is it right to propose or am I just doing my girl big disservice in the long run?

767,ccmolly,Relationships,3rw5ek,1799,"For the past few years, my husband has been teaching our son piano (husband teaches piano as a side job). For the most part our son is a good student, but he is a quick learner and sometimes that causes him to get the big head. I don't think that our son exercises it in a completely unhealthy way (normally he just slacks off some); but my husband has always seen this as a *big* problem, and it has caused a lot of tension between the two (many fights and arguments that have required me to play peacemaker, occasions where my son has quit). To be quite honest, sometimes my husband forgets our kids are still just kids, which is what happened here. 

Our son has been preparing for one of his dad's class recitals (took place last night), but he didn't put in the work that he should have. Long story short, my husband decided that the best way to deal with the problem was to let our son fail in public in order to motivate him to do better in the future. He wound up making our son perform a piece that he was not prepared for, and it was an absolute disaster. The worst part was that he forced our son to struggle through the piece even after it was clear he was humiliated to the point of tears, until I intervened. I think everyone in the room was shocked and appalled at my husband's behavior. I had no idea he was planning this or I would have intervened ahead of time. Our son absolutely did not deserve this, and I had it out with my husband when we got home. 

The problem is that he sees nothing wrong with what he did. I don't know how he's that out of touch with reality. I never imagined he would do something like this or could be so cruel. I don't think there is any excuse for this behavior. How do I get him to see how wrong he is about this and make sure it never happens again to either of our children? How do I get him to understand that there are better ways of motivating our children than humiliation? 

EDIT: when I say my son was not prepared I mean that his father gave him the piece a few hours before the recital, and he had essentially not opportunity to practice. He was basically performing the piece cold.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3g4rgv/my_24_f_lesbian_friend_28_f_refuses_to_understand/


One of our mutual friends had a gathering at his place this past Friday, which was all fun and games and we were mostly drinking and having a good time. At some point, someone brings up our lesbian friend and says something to the effect of, ""Is anyone else getting really fed up with that?"". Now, some of my friends read this thread and were sorting out their own feelings about it in the past two weeks, but this was just what even the shyest among us needed to say ""yeah, it's really fucking bust"". 


A friend on the outskirts of the group apparently texted our lesbian friend telling her somewhat the nature of the conversation, but politely from what he showed us later. More, ""oh, we're having an interesting conversation and it sort of has to do with you, let's talk about it later"" than ""all your friends are talking shit"". But of course she showed up. She wasn't NOT invited as far as I'm aware, as these parties tend to just happen and people show up and leave as they'd like once they're told about them, but she wasn't SPECIFICALLY asked to come either, so it was a bit awkward. 


As soon as she's through the door she seizes the attention and launches into a story about how she had just come from a date and that she and this girl had a great time and that she'd been dating this girl for the past two weeks. Some of us reacted with suspicion. Some of us reacted pleasantly. My shy friend that I mentioned congratulated her and asked her if things were getting serious, and for some reason this was the totally innocuous comment that was needed to set everything ablaze. 


""I bet you'd like that, so I have less time to hang around you guys."" 


We know this passive aggressive journey. None of us want to undertake it because we're having fun. So immediately the host says that's out of line, and that we're happy for her, and she launches into this tirade about how there's no way it's possible for us to be happy for her because we don't support gay relationships. Our gay friend pipes up that that isn't so, but without missing a beat she hits him with a ""you don't count"" and then a ""everyone likes gay MEN because you're 'sassy' and 'fun', it's ME and LESBIANS they have a problem with"". We didn't happen to have any token lesbians lying around, so we couldn't refute that with gay evidence, but suffice to say no one hesitated to bring up how that's utter horsecocks. Real in real life for sure, but definitely not in that room. 


At this point, someone brought up the aggressive hitting on straight girls and asked if the new girl identified as gay, because if so that's a great step and it's probably ideal. She said it didn't fucking matter because they were going to be happy with her, which...sure, I guess. I bit my tongue and made no comment about the ""going to"" and wisely didn't ask if the girl was aware that these are dates. I didn't need to ask, she revealed that they met at the bar she regularly frequents and the girl didn't previously date women but she would now. Sure, we know this path very well from college. 


She accused the host of the part of being insensitive because he didn't invite this girl to the party, this girl who until 30 minutes prior we had no idea existed. 


Up until then, everyone had been pretty careful to not make this seem like an intervention or like we're all ganging up on her. People are tuning in and out of the conversation, there are other conversations throughout, but she starts getting huffy and self righteous and it's obvious that more than a few of us have had enough. 


So at this point, I sort of tell her that it's a destructive pattern for her and for everyone involved, and that I'm not interested in being apart of it anymore, even tangentially. Almost everyone agrees, tells her that we're willing to be her friend and stuff, but not until she gets her shit together. Until such a time of shit togetheredness, she's not invited to our gatherings. She tells our shy friend that she only hit on her out of pity. That most of us are only in relationships because it's easy. She rages at us, telling us that we're all hypocrites and something about deep rooted homophobia and leaves, slamming the door in a huff. 


We all agree that she is not invited to future gatherings, and throughout the weekend none of us have heard from her except a scathing text I got that more or less read, ""you're a huge ol' bitch, and as someone without a traditional sexuality I should know better and I'm 'next'"". 


TLDR: We're all homophobes and hypocrites. But, we're pretty okay with that. ",1440435960.0,[UPDATE] My [24 F] lesbian friend [28 F] refuses to understand that her aggressive hitting on of straight girls is hypocritical and off putting. [UPDATE],0.92
769,Punchdrunklady,Relationships,4lubms,1795,"Boyfriend and I have been together for two years. I have known his brother, who I will call ""R""  for most of that time. We have always gotten on well enough. 


The whole situation started with my 21st birthday party. We had a party at home with 20 or so friends of family, R was of course present at the party, along with a few other members of BFs family. 

The party was going reasonably well, as it started to get later I started to get a little tipsy, and most of the guests had started to go home. It eventually got down to a drunken little group made up of myself, boyfriend, R and a couple of my girlfriends. 

We were sitting outside and one of my girlfriends decided to get on the trampoline, she managed to execute a pretty cool flip, and I expressed that I wished I knew how to do one. 

My friend talked me into giving it a try. I got up on the tramp, stumbled drunkenly and fell down laughing. Everyone else (except for BF) was laughing also. It didn't seem like much of an event until BF got up, muttered ""fucking pathetic"" in an angry tone and then told me that we needed to speak in private. 


I was pretty confused as to what was going on, so I asked him ""why?""- he answered me with ""Just stop being a stupid cow for a second and come to the bedroom"" 

Both of my friends and R looked pretty shocked at this, but I before I followed BF to the bedroom I told them it was fine and BF was probably just messing around. He can have a real temper sometimes, particularly after a few drinks but I didn't think that would be the case in this instance as literally NOTHING upsetting had happened. 


Cut to me and BF in the bedroom. He shuts the door and starts really going off. He tells me that I'm a disgusting drunk idiot and that I was showing off like some kind of pathetic wannabe by messing around on the trampoline. That I was an embarrassment to him and that I was to go to bed now and not leave the room until morning so that I would be more of an idiot in front of company. 


As this is going on he is getting louder and louder and is slamming things around the room. I went to leave as I was quite upset at this point, but he blocks the door so I sit down on the bed. 


R is banging on the door and tells BF to open in. BF goes out into the hall and I can hear he and R arguing. Next thing I know it R comes into the room and says to go with him. I was sobbing like crazy at this point, because I hate confrontation in general, so I just nod and go with him. 

R makes sure my other friends have left and then we both get into a taxi. I don't know where BF has gone but he is still in the house sow where. 

I'm crying a bunch in the car and don't say much, but R calls his and BFs mother and gives her a brief rundown of what happened. 

We got to R's place, he lives with a couple and they were all really nice. The girl roomate leant me some stuff to sleep in and R told me to take his bed and he would sleep on the couch. I was kind of all over the place but eventually got some sleep. 

Next morning I got up and had coffee with R and one of his roommates. R asked if BF had behaved that way before and I let him know about BFs temper but explained that he had never blown up over something as insignificant as me mucking around on a trampoline. I asked R if he thought maybe I did or said something that might have upset BF and didn't realise due to being tipsy, but R said no, and that BFs behaviour was unacceptable. 


I felt silly and embarrassed, especially knowing that R and my friends had heard everything BF had said, and I told R I had better get home and try to sort things out. 

R said that he wanted to stay at his place for just a bit longer to calm down, and that he would really rather prefer that I didn't go home straight away as BF could still be angry. 

I gave in an hung out there with R and his roommates, we all just played video games and got some takeout, and I ended up feeling much better afterward- so I'm glad I stayed. 

Early evening a told R I should really go home, I didn't have any of my clothes and more importantly I needed my stuff for university the next day. He drove me over, but didn't really want me to go inside. I told him it would really be fine and promised I would call him if anything happened. 

He agreed but said he would wait outside for a few minutes just in case. 

I got inside and BF wasn't home so I told R to go and went about tidying up from the party. 

BF eventually rocked up and seemed calm enough. I told him I thought we needed to have a talk and he agreed. 

We sat down on the couch and I explained to him that I didn't think the way he spoke to me last night and asked for an explanation. 

His response was ""I will discuss that with you after you delete R's phone number, you won't be speaking to him again"" 

I was confused as all hell at this and asked what that had to do with the matter at hand. 

He told me that R disrespected him by interfering in our relationship, and that we were cutting ties with him. He told me he wouldn't discuss anything else about the night before until I did that. 

I told BF I thought that was pretty unnecessary, and that R had been trying to help me because BF was acting really threatening, and that I would have probably done the same in R's shoes. 

Well, BF did not like that. He yelled, called me some names and left the house. After a few hours he sent me a text 

""I am sorry for yelling, but you need to respect what I want if you want the same in return. This can't be one sided. Delete R's number and we will finish the conversation. Love you"" 


I replied that I needed a little time to think and said I would be sleeping in the spare room when he got home and to please leave me some for a while. 

I went to bed, heard BF come in very late. He opened the door to the spare room and turned the light on, but as I woke up he just walked out of the room and slammed the door. 

So this morning I've woken up, BF is at work and I have a text from R, it says- 

Hey **** , I hope you're ok. Look what BF did the other night is really not alright and I think you should get out of there for a while. I've talked to.  **** and **** and it's totally fine for you to crash here until you figure out what you want to do


So that leaves me where I am now. Don't know what to do about the situation- do as BF asks and cut contact with R, or take R's offer of some space away from BF to clear my head. My worry is that if I stay at R's that will destroy any chance of fixing things with BF. Advice very much appreciated.





   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriends brother spoke up and took me away when BF was blowing up about something fairly small. BF wants me to cut ties with his brother, because he thinks him helping me was disrespectful to him and outer relationship.

She came down and left at 8:30am. I saw her leaving and asked her when she would be back and she said she didn't know. My SO, kids and I have had a lovely morning having breakfast and opening gifts.

So when I left you all a couple days ago I was on my way home to talk with my boyfriend due to the fact I just found out that the friend was moving in the next day. Well, excuse my language, but shit hit the fan. I probably didn't react as calmly as I should have, but my emotions were running pretty high that day. When I originally made the post, I wasn't aware of what was really going on with my relationship. You all had opened my eyes and made me realize that I was getting taken advantage of financially and emotionally. I let my boyfriend know that it wasn't fair for me to foot the bill for the mortgage and utilities by myself. We're in a partnership. He got very, very angry that I would ""accuse"" him of using me for money and being a freeloader. I asked him if he thought that it was fair to me and to put himself in my shoes. I laid out what I pay per month for all of the bills (which is kind of shocking that I'm able to do this all by myself). He lost it and asked why I was even with him if I thought all of this stuff about him. And then he left....


I received a text from him last night (Sunday) stating how sorry he was and how he would start helping me out. I told him that he needs to prove to me that he will actually follow through. I'm not just going to forgive him and then have things go back the way they were. So, I'm not sure if that's the update that you all were looking for, but I did stand up for myself. And that felt great. Thank you all so much for the words of encouragement! I could not have done this without a little nudge from Reddit.

Our parents got divorced when we were around 7 years old. The memories are kinda blurry but I do remember that one day dad was in the house with us and the next he had his things packed and told us he was leaving. As little kids we were sad but eventually got over it as we were able to see both parents and they did everything they could to make us happy. 

I am not going to take trash about our mother, but she has been in and out of relationships so much we usually can't even remember the names of her exs as little as 4 months ago. We also have two younger siblings (7 & 8) but we know they're only our half siblings. She has always told us that their relationship problems and why they divorced was none of our business and that what's in the past is in the past. We never dared to ask. But recently we heard her talking to some of her friends (they all get together and catch up at least once a month) about her and dad. I don't know if they forgot we were up there or just didn't realize how loud they were being but we heard all of it. Mom was telling them how when dad had his surgery (he was going through a illness but is fully recovered now) he was weak, depressed, and ""useless"" and she had another man that was ""giving her what she wanted"" the whole time.

The whole conversation is too long to repeat here but she kept on insulting him and calling him some cruel names. My sister started crying and left to go to her room. I went to comfort her but she was pretty shaken at some of the things she had heard. She told me that she hated mom and now that she knew the real reason why they divorced, she didn't want anything else to do with her. I understand how she's feeling and I'm furious about it as well, but I'm also confused on how we should handle this/or even if we have a right to be mad because it was so many years ago.

Honestly I don't see her in the same way anymore and I guess feel kinda ""betrayed"" (as dramatic as that sounds) because of how she treated dad. I know exactly how my sisters feeling. And I feel like if we don't control it we're just going to create more drama that we don't need.

This is an update to my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2usj40/my_best_friend_24f_didnt_ask_me_24f_to_be_in_her/) that got locked. While I did appreciate everyone's concerns for my health, I was more thankful for the help with my problem with my so-called best friend.

A lot has happened in the time since my post. I held off on updating because I was hoping things would take a turn for the better between the two of us, but I don't think that's happening.

Anyway.  I feel really stupid at this point because as several of you pointed out, this girl has no idea what being a friend really is. I had scheduled drinks with my friend (we'll call her Ariel because that's her name and I no longer care what she thinks) on that Friday and I decided to confront her then on what our stylist had told me. I just said I'd heard that the real reason I wasn't asked to be in her wedding was due to my appearance. The first thing she did was get all defensive and ask ""Who told you?""  It took me a second, but that clued me in that she has not only said this, but has said it to more people than just our stylist. I said it didn't matter but that I was really hurt by it especially in light of how much help I was giving her, she said, ""I know you have, like, really low self-esteem, and I know you wouldn't want to be in pictures looking like you do right now, so I was going to put a 'very special thank you' to you in my programs."" She put an emphasis on ""was"" and her tone made it like she thought she was doing me a favor.

I wanted to talk about how it made me feel but Ariel could not stop about who had told me. She just kept on about how people were so rude and had no concept of what ""being told in confidence"" meant and that whoever had told me was a bad friend, not just to her but to me, and that she was sure that the person was trying to stir up shit.

She then said she didn't have the time for this and walked out of the bar leaving a $5 on the table (for a $6 drink, THANKS) so I settled up the check and left.

When I got home I tried to check her Facebook page and lo and behold I'm blocked. I texted a mutual friend to snoop the page for me so of course I had to tell her what was up, and she said, ""Jesus, she's vaguebooking all over, this is all about you?"" She sent me screen shots of Ariel's statuses like ""OK whichever one of you rude bitches can't keep your mouth shut about things that don't concern you just unfriend me now because I'm done with you,"" and ""And people call me a drama queen, I can't believe this is coming up 71 days before my wedding when I'm already so stressed out"" and ""When I find out who stabbed me in the back they will pay I promise you"" etc. 

Apparently this friend spread the word of my conflict with Ariel because over that weekend I started getting a lot of texts from old college friends who filled me in on the truth. She'd told several girls that she would have asked them to be bridesmaids but that she couldn't without asking me, and I wasn't in ""bridesmaid form"" and it wouldn't be fair to leave just me out, so none of them could be bridesmaids because of me.  I have had long talks with one of the girls (""Jessica"") who said that Ariel has been talking bad about me behind my back about how I'm trying to take attention away from her, The Bride and how it's my fault that she wasn't going to have a big line of bridesmaids like she wanted.

Jessica says she has been sort of distancing herself from Ariel because she thinks Ariel is a user and treats ""friends"" horribly and that no offense, but I seem unable to see it. She says Ariel is fun and interesting and can be really charming when she's getting her way but when she's not she gets catty and mean. She said, ""I know you consider Ariel your best friend but how much of that is actually geography? You weren't really best friends during college, I think you and I were actually closer back then, before I moved to Big City. Isn't it only because Ariel is still in Little Town that you think of her as your best friend? I think she's your nearest friend, but I think you have friends who are better for you that just don't live in Little Town anymore.""

It's true. I have lived in my town my whole life, the college I went to is here (paid for by my parents, if I had chosen a different school I'd have been on my own) and while the vast majority of my high school friends went to university elsewhere, the few who did go to the local school escaped to jobs in larger cities after graduation. I still live with my parents and work at a family-owned business. I guess I've been clinging to Ariel (who actually works in the alumni office of the university) because she's the only one left. I'm really close with my cousins who all work in the family business too, but it's not the same as having friends who are not related to you.

Since that Friday I've had no contact with Ariel and lots more with other college friends, especially Jessica, who lives in the largest city in our state. Apparently since our altercation, Ariel has asked Jessica and at least three other girls to be bridesmaids. Jessica declined, as did two others. Jessica thinks the fourth girl will do it but whatever. Jessica is downright disgusted with Ariel's behavior and probably won't go to the wedding at all unless something major changes by the time RSVPs are due. As I suspected, I was not sent an invitation.

Jessica thinks I should consider applying for jobs in her city and being more independent. I'd be close to premier doctors, I already know several people there, and Jessica says its a great city for people our age. I just dismissed the idea at first, but the more I've thought about it the more I am coming around. While it would be hard to move away from the town I've lived in my whole life (and my family) I think it would be good to get away from here. Jessica says I could move in with her at least for a few paychecks to save up for deposits on my own place. I have brought it up as an idea to my parents and I hope they'll be supportive if I go for it. I told my boyfriend about the possibility and he was kind of whiny at first, which was understandable, but in the last couple of days, he has said it could be very positive, and who knows, he might move too. He lives in a nearby town that's just as limiting socially without the benefit of a small private university in it. In the meantime, it'd be long distance but not terribly so, a bit more than 2 hours each way to drive. Next weekend I am going over to stay with Jessica and her roommate for a couple of days to hang out and see what I think of the neighborhood. Even if I decide not to move she says I can use her apartment when I come to see doctors.

That was a low blow as even though I work less hours than he does with my job, I'm currently studying a master?s degree full time too so I'm working incredibly hard.

I showed him my post and he changed his tune. Seeing other people saying his sleep issues were concerning made him do a complete 180. He apologised for not taking the problem seriously. He decided to fix his eating habits as the first thing he tried as that seemed the most likely cause. He was pretty open that his diet wasn't good. I told him he also needed to work on our relationship and he agreed. He said he wanted us to work and that he loved me so he was willing to do anything.

It didn't end up that way. The next day it was as if he had forgotten everything he promised. He was eating chips, falling asleep and not talking to me about anything. When he still hadn't looked into his diet the next day, I asked him to. We ended up arguing and he admitted that for years he has made promises to change without any intention of actually changing just to shut me up. It wasn't just promises over his sleep issues, it was everything. He also admitted that he believes apologising means that I should automatically forgive him no matter what he?s done wrong and said that it's not okay for me to ever get mad at him, even though he's often mad at me. It was just so warped and it hurt a lot to hear. I cried and he said didn't know what to say so he went to bed. So I cried alone.

I broke up with him. I told a mutual friend about his sleep issues and asked them to keep an eye on him so I know he's not alone. He seems devastated that I'm leaving and he made more promises to change, but I think this will be best for him in the long run. I think this will force him to confront his issues without having someone to blame or rely on. I know it's best for me.
   
**tl;dr**: Told my boyfriend my concerns and he dismissed them, so I showed him my reddit post and he did a 180. He promised to figure out his sleeping issue and work on our relationship, but he fell at the first hurdle and admitted he has never had any intention of changing.

775,jayhawks738,Relationships,6qt5gm,1789,"My wife and I have been together for 4 years and married for one with a baby on the way. My wife's sister Laura I have never met until the wedding. She was somewhat estranged from the family, as in she lived in a different country with another man and did not speak to the family much due to other issues. She is now back and has left the guy. My wife has three other siblings. 

Anyway when I met her at the wedding she was polite and sweet. She made a comment about me being handsome but didn't think much of it. 

Well I'll get into the story. Basically everytime we have family gatherings at their house or when her sister comes over I feel as if she acts somewhat inappropriate. Hugs kind of last long, she has put her hands on my leg or arm a few times and has left it there. She makes comments about my appearence (in front of my wife). 

She finds everything I say hilarious and calls me her favorite in law. Twice she has dropped something in front of me and has bent down slowly. It just seems all pretty odd to me. 

The biggest thing that has happened was a few days ago. She came over to chat with my wife and they went shopping for baby things. When they got back she complained about her shoulders hurting and  asked if I could rub them for her. Since my wife told her I'm good at it. She asked my wife I mean if that's okay with you? My wife said she didn't mind, which surprised me.

Anyway I did it because I felt kind of put on the spot. She remarked how good it felt and when I tried to end it she said it felt really good and just a few more minutes, afterwards she said next time I could do her feet. 

She's nice and polite, but I just get a weird vibe from her. My wife is so happy she's back and the last thing I want to do is ruin their relationship. Should I just continue to ignore it?

My father has been on life support since he collapsed at 12am on 7/5/17. His heart had stopped for 8-10 minutes before he was treated. The hospital did a lot of tests to determine brain death, and yesterday they told us the bad news, that he was certainly already gone and the time of death was called. 

My family and I decided, knowing my father's wonderful giving spirit, should be an organ donor. Honestly my dad would be surprised and thrilled to know some of his organs are viable. So last night we signed the documents which prepare him for the donation process. 

Today, most likely they will take him off life support to try and recover the organs they can. I understand that he is already gone and he is basically now an empty shell/cadaver which they are preserving with advanced technology. But still, I feel it may be very difficult for me today to actually say goodbye and see him with his heart beating for the last time. Now I'm trying to figure out how to cope with this.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Will and I have been friends since...pretty much forever. We literally grew up together. Our mothers are best friends, and we were raised by each other's families in this sort of semi-commune type situation. His mom is like a second mom to me, and mine is the same to him; we've both always said that we lucked out to have two sets of parents and this huge extended family because of it. I see him as a brother, exactly as a brother. I feel the same way about him as I do my bio-brothers. I've never had ANY romantic feelings for him, and it's honestly disgusting when people make jokes about that, to me. I always thought it was the same for him, because that's what he told me, several times over the years. 

We all went to the same, local University and lived at home and by all, I mean me, my siblings, Will and his siblings, to save some money and because honestly it's a great school. So, because we stayed so close, we all met everyone's SOs and really got to know them. I clicked with Will's college girlfriend, Sarah, who he proposed to last year and married last week. I couldn't be happier for them, and to have Sarah as a ""sister"" in our weird little family, which is what makes this next part even worse, because I'm not sure how to handle this. 

Will messaged me on their wedding night, and told me that he had always loved me, and had hoped that I'd feel the same way too, and he only got married to Sarah as a way to make me realize my feelings for him and fight for him. He had tried to provoke a reaction, and he didn't love her, he didn't want to be with her, and now he just wanted to tell me, because he'd leave her for me, if I wanted. I didn't know what to say so I just signed out of everything for the night and cried, because everything about that just made me feel sick, and it was too much. Just...too much to process. It was like my brother was admitting incestuous feelings for me. 

He's messaged me throughout his honeymoon, almost all of them begging me to run away with him, and a few of them were blaming me for ""leading him on"", which still makes zero sense to me. I've never flirted with him. I act the same way around him as I do any of my siblings, literally nothing is different. He said that he'd always see me, in his head as ""the other woman"", and because of me, he'd never be able to fully love Sarah, who he admits is, on paper, his ideal spouse. 

I don't know what to do, because both of us stand to lose a lot no matter how this all goes down. I'm afraid that I'm going to lose my family because of this, and not just his side. Everyone is close, and if I'm identified as ""the problem"", I'm afraid that I'm going to be pushed out, but maybe that's what needs to happen. I really don't know. Reddit, how the fuck do I deal with this hugely fucked up situation? I need some outside advice, and don't have anyone in my life who doesn't know any of the people involved in this.

Edit for more information. Sorry I didn't include this to begin with, but I'm not thinking 100% clearly right now, I still feel just terrible about everything. More info: Our families live in the same house, and our parents shared parenting duties for all children. When I called out for ""Daddy"" in the middle of the night as a little girl, *both* Dads came running, for example. Our families are so intertwined, and always have been, and I feel like Will just handed me this huge bomb. I think there's going to be massive fall out from this, and that breaks my heart. We're all very close and tightly knit. I keep cycling between sad, angry and betrayed. I'm upset because I feel like he's tasking me with breaking Sarah's heart, and I hate him for that right now. I love Sarah, possibly more than he does at this point.

778,altarissues,Updates,3u3xq3,1788,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t1d28/my_27f_boyfriend_28m_of_1_year_wants_to_move_in/

I received so much feedback from my last post that I had to thank you all, first off, for reading and listening. I want to clarify a number of things before I continue:

 Dating an atheist as someone who keeps an altar has never been an issue before. I am not ""seriously religious"" and my beliefs have never stood in the way of anything. There are no rules I follow, it doesn't change my sociopolitical alignment, etc. It's a dedicated place for me to pay respects to my ancestors and to the saints I work with. It's no different than you setting up a dedicated room for video games ;)

I think reddit should open up to learning about religion beyond direct examples of Christianity or the other big ones. I saw a lot of ignorant comments that clearly don't comprehend why people keep altars (and believe me when I say that there are *many* of us, and no, we are not mentally ill! That's just silly.)

On to the update! 

I used a lot of the conversations from my post to determine how I would talk with him about it. But it turned out, he read my post! And he read the comments himself -- and, even better, he was able to come to me with his concerns and communicate to me what he was worried about, and how he felt. 

We ended up talking for a long time about the issue, and it boiled down to him being a little afraid, and not understanding my practice. He said he has always been a little uncomfortable about it because he's been trained to see this stuff as ""weird"" and ""creepy"" and things like that. He asked me to explain it more, and to give him some time to read up on what I was doing so he could familiarize himself with it. 

He took a few days, but in the end, when he came back to me to talk about it, he told me that he was no longer worried, and that he was sorry that he had made it into such a big deal. He even asked if it would be okay for him to light a tealight now and then, because he likes the idea of candles as offerings or recognition of the deceased. 

He bought a stack of books to read up on regarding this stuff, and he is reading a little bit each night. He is very apologetic about how things went down and how he seemed, but I understand that his tone and behavior were absolutely due to him not understanding or knowing about this stuff. 

Things are going great now, and we are still on track to move in together. The conversation about it not just being ""his"" house struck him the most.

Thank you for you help, Reddit!

779,,Non-Romantic,4euw7m,1791,"Three months ago me and my little sister ?Gianna? moved to our current hometown from literally the other side of the country. We had been living with our parents for our entire lives, and to put it simply, they are extremely shitty people?they are hyper-narcissists, physically abusive, emotionally abusive, etc. After years and years of dealing with all of their shit, I had decided that enough was enough. I went through a very long and intensely painful legal battle to obtain custody of Gianna and become her legal guardian. I finally succeeded, and I decided that we needed to get away from where we grew up. One of my friends ?Matt? (21M) from high school goes to college in a relatively well-off small town?it?s one of those wealthy college town places. He lives off-campus in his own house, and he made an offer for me and Gianna to live with him for a while. I thanked him endlessly, took him up on his offer, and we?ve been living with him since then. I got a job and I pay rent to him, and Gianna goes to school around here. Ever since I got a job, I?ve been trying to save up money to move out of my friend?s house and get me and Gianna our own place. I want to go to community college in the future and build a stable life for me and Gianna. 

The day me and Gianna moved in with Matt, his next-door neighbor ?Linda? came over to talk to us. She brought us cookies and welcomed us to the neighborhood. She also brought along her son ?Sam? to meet Gianna. She was extremely nosy about why we moved in with Matt?we told her where we?re from, but that was about it. We didn?t want to talk about our past with such a nosy lady. She kept pestering us with questions until Gianna finally said ?It?s none of your business!? Linda looked very offended when she said that. She left us with the cookies, but she stormed back into her house, dragging her son with her. 

When Matt came back from class, we told him about our encounter with Linda, but he just laughed and told us she was nothing to worry about. According to him, she was extremely passive-aggressive, and that was all there was to it. The rest of the neighbors hate her guts. We didn?t know what else to think, so we took his word for it. 

For roughly a week, Linda didn?t talk to us, but eventually she came around and apologized. She said she didn?t want to get off on the wrong foot with us. She brought Sam with her again and wanted him to get to know Gianna. The only interaction they had shared at that point was waiting at the bus stop together, and Linda wanted them to spend some time together today. I always ask Gianna if she?s okay with these kinds of things before they happen, and she gave me a look that said she basically didn?t give a shit about spending an hour with Sam. They went outside to play, and Linda invited me over to her house for coffee.

As soon as we sat down, Linda made a comment to me about what Gianna said to her last week, telling her that our past was none of her business. She thought Gianna had been rude and disrespectful. I don?t know if all kids are like this, but Gianna often tells it like it is. She doesn?t behave that way to purposely antagonize anyone, however. I explained to Linda that Gianna is pretty straight up about what she thinks, and that she didn?t mean to provoke her on purpose. I didn?t apologize for what Gianna said, though, because I agree with Gianna that our past is none of Linda?s business. It seemed like Linda was expecting me to apologize, and when I didn?t, she looked intensely bothered. She quickly changed the subject, however, and she started to blab about the ?funny things? that Sam says. I won?t go into detail on that because it?ll bore everyone to death, but I?ll just say that from her stories that Sam seems like a problematic kid. Spoiled, mouthy, badly behaved, etc. I also learned that Linda seems hell-bent on presenting her family as picture perfect as she possibly can. She has an older son and an older daughter who I?ve never seen but from her account are the best kids to ever walk this Earth. She seems like a major perfectionist to me. 

After the hour at Linda?s, I went back home and found Gianna in the kitchen. I asked her how Sam was, and she said he was fine. She added ?He?s a total brat, but I can deal with him!? when she saw the surprised look on my face, as I hadn?t expected him to be just ?fine?. Gianna is a pretty resilient little kid, though, so I trusted her to take care of herself when Sam is around. 

A few days later, Linda brought over her husband and Sam?s father ?Jim? for us to meet. He had just returned from a business trip and he was heading off on another one in a few days, so Linda didn?t want his opportunity to meet us to slip away. He seemed 100% disengaged throughout my entire conversation with him. He kept checking his phone, and at one point he stepped out of the room to take a call. I inferred from this behavior that he?s probably a very busy man. I don?t really want to get to know him, though, because at one point he remarked that he was extremely relieved that Matt and I weren?t partners. Yikes. 

After living next door to Linda and her family for about three months, it?s become clear that Sam truly is a miniature piece of shit. At the bus stop, he pokes and flicks Gianna and doesn?t relent until she yells at him to stop. On the bus, he sat behind her and kicked the seat constantly until the bus driver forced him to sit in the back of the bus. At school, they?re in the same class, and on the first day she arrived he told the entire class that he saw her looking through his bedroom window the first night we moved in (obviously this is 100% bullshit), alienating her from the very start. During class, he steals her supplies, calls her names, etc. When they?re at home and the neighborhood kids are around, he constantly makes fun of her and makes rude comments about her to the other kids. Gianna always tells me about these incidents before anyone else does, which I think is pretty irresponsible on the school?s part and on our neighbors? part. I talked to both the bus driver and their teacher, and they said they would keep an eye on Sam, but I?m pretty sure nothing will come of that. I tried talking to Linda a few times, but she just kept brushing me off, saying that ?It?s just what boys do? and even suggesting that Sam may have a crush on Gianna. The neighbors said the same kind of stuff. I told Gianna this and she thought it was disgusting. Her response was ?Only stupid people believe that. Boys who tease girls to show them that they like-like them need to find a different way.?

However, when Gianna and Sam aren?t in school or when they aren?t around other kids, Sam behaves completely differently. He comes over almost every single day asking Gianna if she wants to play. Strangely, Gianna usually says yes. I keep telling her that she doesn?t have to play with him if she doesn?t want to. He?s a little asshole and doesn?t even deserve to play with her. Honestly, I have no idea how this kid has friends. But she always insists that she?s okay when she plays with him. She never comes home crying or upset after she spends time with him. Every time I ask her how their playing was, she says it was fine. If I press further, she tells me to stop worrying, so I take that as a sign that she?s okay. 

I?ve recently started keeping an eye on Gianna and Sam if I?m around, and Sam behaves very oddly. He still teases her, but she teases him back, which seems to surprise him. On some days he?s in a bad mood, and it shows in his conversations with Gianna. He complains endlessly, but Gianna is pretty patient with him, way more than I would be if I was a ten-year-old kid. But on other days he?s cheery and friendly toward her, and they have a good time. Honestly, their relationship is a mystery to me. 

However, yesterday, I was in the kitchen cooking, and I overheard them yelling extremely loudly. I ran outside and found Gianna crying. Still sobbing, she told me had been playing on their Nintendo DSes, and Sam had lost their game to her for the third time in a row. He had grabbed her DS out of her hands and snapped it in two, breaking it. Her DS was the only valuable she owned. She yelled at him and he actually swung a fist at her. The punch didn?t land, because she grabbed his arm in time, but since she?s been physically abused in the past she was basically having an emotional breakdown. This was the last straw for me. I angrily told Sam he was no longer allowed to play with Gianna anymore. I didn?t call him a fuckhole to his face, but I sure wanted to.

Sam ran inside crying. I took Gianna inside. A few minutes later Linda stormed into the house screaming like a banshee. She told me that Gianna was a horrible little girl and that she was not raised well in the slightest. She said she needed manners and that if she was her kid, she would be disciplined the proper way. I didn?t even get a chance to explain to her that her son was the piece of shit, not Gianna, because she left before I could say a word. I have no idea what Sam said to his mom to provoke her response, but it was probably a huge lie. 

I spent the rest of the night taking care of Gianna. I cooked her favorite meal for dinner and we watched a movie together. I even laid down with her in her bed when she went to sleep. This morning I told her she didn?t have to go to school if she didn?t want to, but she said she was okay. 

This afternoon, Gianna came running into the house after school. She told me that Sam came to school late today, and that he had a broken arm and a gigantic black eye. Even the teacher was shocked. The entire class kept asking him what happened, but all he said was that he had fallen down the stairs at home. When Gianna approached him at recess asking him if he was okay, he didn?t respond and he walked away as quickly as he could. 
When I heard this, I instantly saw major red flags, and Gianna did too. But my question for you guys is, where should I go from here?
 
My initial instinct was to call the police. The reason I?m hesitating is because the only evidence I have is Sam?s appearance. Linda has NEVER, and I mean NEVER, shown any signs of physical or emotional abuse, and believe me, I know the signs. Perfectionism sometimes exists alongside emotional abuse, but I have never been around Linda when she hasn?t showered her son with praise and affection. She constantly talks about how much she loves him, and she?s involved as a parent leader in every single one of his activities. She will go to infinite lengths to defend him even when he fucks up, as I saw yesterday, and she seems to think that he can do no wrong. If the authorities show up at her doorstep, I have reason to believe that she would act perfectly sane about the entire situation, because appearance is everything to her. I?m guessing that she?ll act like everything is 100% a-OK, and once the authorities leave, she?ll turn on me, or even worse, on my sister for telling me about Sam?s condition. When she ran into the house yesterday to scream at me, I just thought she was a fucking crazy parent. After today, I have no clue what to think about her. 

I asked Gianna if Sam has ever shown any signs of going through abuse of any kind, and she said no. Whenever he complains (which is practically 24/7), it?s never about his family. In fact, she said he never talks about his family. This only added to my confusion.

So, Reddit, what should I do? I am completely lost as to where to go from here. Matt hasn?t returned from class yet, so I?ll fill him in when he gets back, and hopefully I?ll have some more background on Linda soon. Sam is a little shit, but that certainly doesn?t mean he deserves a broken arm and a black eye. 

**tl;dr**: Me and my little sister live next door to this crazy woman and her son. Her son and my sister have a weird relationship, but yesterday he triggered her and she was a wreck. His mom came over and exploded on me. Today her son came to school late with a broken arm and black eye. Unsure of how to proceed.

780,InviteThrowaway22,Non-Romantic,4nm6fc,1789,"**Edit** I spoke with Andy a few minutes ago.  He called to apologize and mentioned that he spoke to Liz and she was not at all surprised.  He said her exact response was ""we didn't them to our wedding. I'm not all that surprised, especially when he probably doesn't have large control over the guest list due to their culture.""  He said that while he's hurt, he understands and that maybe we can get together before or after and work something out.

**Edit 2** Spoke to Steve and Rachel.  This conversation did not go as well.  Rachel was very accusative and called me ""rude and inconsiderate"" to not invite them.  Steve then piled on and noted it was ""different"" in the case where they didn't invite me, since they had a much smaller wedding.  He was also surprised that I would hold a ""grudge"".

I let them speak for a few more minutes before I stopped them and explained to them very clearly that I am not in charge of the full guest list, and that this guest list is roughly half of the guest list we wanted.   On top of that, based on cultural norms and other issues, we had to give priority to a lot of other family and friends.  And that despite whatever they think is ""different"" about their situation.  I have the same problem they do, just on a larger scale.  I then pointed out that while I don't hold a grudge, yes I was offended that I wasn't invited, and yes, it hurt a lot that other friends and distant relatives were invited when I was the only one who stepped up to keep Steve off the streets for months.

I also pointed out that I found it tacky that they thought it appropriate to mention that I didn't give them a wedding gift (and completely disregarding the dinner).  I told them that while they were not explicitly invited, I was also not looking for them to provide me a gift, in line with common etiquette.  

Rachel was quiet for a few seconds and then she said, well.  Are we going to be invited to the wedding or are we done?

I very calmly stated that the core wedding ceremony and the main western style ceremony were at capacity and that we won't be adjusting the guest list.  In terms of the Pre-Wedding shower, and the more ethnic reception, we have some flexibility, but based on our discussion and the general rudeness and sense of condescension from both you and Steve, that no, I will not be extending an invitation.  The fact that you felt it appropriate to exclude me and Ellie from your celebrations but that you feel entitled and EXPECT us to invite you to ours without so much as a real apology...wow.   

Steve just said Really? and then hung up.

----------------------------------------------------

Based on the updates...i'm going to see what Andy has to say, I may end up inviting him and Liz since they both seem very conciliatory and understand my reasoning.  I'd be ok with stretching a bit to accommodate them.  

----------------------------------------------------

Hello Reddit, Throwaway since my friends also read Reddit. (Not Sure about this sub specifically).  Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text.

Anyways, Myself and my Fiancee, Ellie, have been seeing each other for about 3 years now.  It's been long distance, and it's been tough with Visa issues and all sorts of other problems to get her into the country.  We finally had the proper statuses granted, and she's finally getting here so we can get hitched ^_^.   Sufficed to say, we're both super relieved that we no longer have to fly halfway around the world every month or 2 to see each other.


We've been planning the wedding, and it's going down in a few months and everyone is super excited since it's a multi-day blow out event (due to my culture), something like 1200 people over 3 days with 350 people at the actual wedding, and 400 people at 2 separate receptions due to the volume of people.  I'll talk more about this a bit later and why the numbers are ridiculous like this and I think some overlap at a pre-wedding shower that happens the day before.


Anyways, most of you know long distance is hard, things progress slower, things fall apart faster, so it takes A LOT of work to make them last.   And while I know it's an excuse, I was sort of OK with my friendships weakening because of my love for Ellie.   She ran into a similar problem due to the time commitments involved in the timezone differences and traveling (we'd alternate 1 month me, 1 month her, 1 month both of us got to some destination).  On top of that, I'd usually have to travel for a week or more for work a month.


Enter my 2 friends and their wives, Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz (same age as me).    We've been friends since elementary school and while we went to separate colleges, we kept in touch and we all stayed in pretty close contact over the years.   We're not super ultra close friends, but we'd usually hang out once or twice a month and for big events over the past decade...until 3 years ago.  Since my GF at the time lived far away, and I was traveling a lot for work and to see Ellie we all didn't hang out as often.  In all fairness a chunk of it falls on me since I flaked out a few times (though they did a number of times too the few times we were able to plan things).   We ended up only seeing each other once or twice a quarter.  I knew Rachel and Liz for quite some time as well including the full duration of both their relationships with my friends (and we were friends as well).  Steve actually lived with me for about 6 months after he lost his job due to burn out and I let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  He actually met Rachel during this time and I covered for the fact that he was unemployed and homeless (he's since told her and it's a funny story in our group).


My friends during this time met Ellie maybe once or twice...since our trips weren't long, we'd spend time in each other's company or go do tourist things / meet family, and friends if there was applicable time.  Steve and  Rachel got married 2 years, they threw a smaller wedding about 150 people.  We spoke and they talked about the engagement and everything, but I wasn't really posted on the wedding details.  I found out about the wedding when I had made plans with a friend, Paul, and he was like ""oh dude, we can't that day, it's Steve's wedding...don't you remember?""   I was a bit dumbfounded and responded with ""oh...I actually didn't know...I wasn't invited.""


Cue the next day when Steve calls me and to apologize and say that he got an earful from Paul about me not being invited and not even being invited to the bachelor party and that he'd like to extend and invitation to me to attend the bachelor party but unfortunately that they are at capacity for the wedding and that ""you understand how these things go, we have to cut people all the time. Sorry bro.""  I tell him thanks for the thought, but that I politely decline, and wish him the best and that I'll catch up with him and Rachel after the wedding.  I was pretty hurt though.  A few weeks later, Ellie was in town, so Steve, Rachel, Ellie and I all went to a really fancy dinner, and I covered it as a simple wedding gift to them (more on this later).


A few months later, Andy and Liz get engaged, and I make a joke about hopefully Ellie and I can attend this wedding since we we weren't able to come to the last one (we didn't mention to Andy that Steve didn't invite us).  Lo and behold about 2 months later, Andy calls me and says that ""I tried very hard but we can't get enough people to the wedding, and that it's a relatively small affair (200 people total) and that with family and others, we can't spare space at the ceremony or reception for myself or Ellie. Liz and I want to invite you both out to dinner before and after the wedding.""   I politely say thank you and that I hope they enjoy the ceremony.  I'm again, pretty hurt but don't want them to feel bad.


Enter a few months ago, Ellie and I are traveling in Europe and it just felt right so I put together an impromptu proposal and we got engaged in Paris.   We had talked about it a few times before hand and I was fairly certain she would say yes, and the moment really really just felt right so I proposed with a costume ring I had stealthily bought while we were shopping.  NONE of my friends knew until we announced it on our return...again, I hadn't really planned the proposal, so it wasn't something we announced ahead of time to have a big show about.   We didn't make a big announcement in general, just a number of close friends and family.  


Anyways, enter my family.   Ellie and I are of different cultures and ethnicities.  My parents are usually very conservative and I had suspected some blowback from them when I brought an ""outsider"" in.  We were expecting them to want to keep it relatively quiet and small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised that they were super super excited that I was FINALLYYYYYYY getting married and was choosing to settle down.  My mom has had grandchild fever for a few years now...They also absolutely adore and love Ellie.  According to my mom, ""in this day and age, it's hard to find a woman who is both independent and successful in their career, but also able to cook, clean and maintain a household""...tad sexist I know, but that's how my mom is, I think she's just happy that she has someone she can cook with and share recipes with and all the daughter stuff she's been wanting to do in a house full of 2 boys and a husband.


Anyways, my parents offered to help with the wedding...A LOT.   In my culture, it's sort of ridiculous how extravagant the weddings can be.   The guest list is out of control in some respects, but in my culture it's offensive to not invite people to your wedding who have invited you to their wedding.  Additionally, weddings are huge family affairs so this includes folks from years ago and my parents and her parents friends who all get invited, with families in tow.  Ellie and I already planned a much smaller get together with a number of people about a week before the wedding to ensure that we get quality time with our close friends at a mini-reception.  Most of these friends are also invited to the main wedding, everyone understood.  This mini-reception is 50 people and being held on mine and Ellie's dime. We did not invite Steve, Rachel, Andy or Liz to any of the events.  Honestly, I just forgot, maybe a bit bitter...but in all honesty when listing out all the names and families and seating arrangements, our eyes just kind of gloss over.   Our parents both opted to cover 80% of the wedding to accommodate all the cultural norms and to ensure they can invite extended family and friends  We are covering the remaining 20% + honeymoon as well.  While stressful, our parents have been super understanding and helpful in the planning, so Ellie and I are OK with going with the flow.


Anyways, Myself and a lot of friends were out last night having a night on the town, including Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz.  Ellie is currently in her home country sorting out her affairs in prep for the final move over to the states.   We're all a bit drunk and Rachel asked when the invites for our wedding were going out.  Without thinking, I blurted out, oh we sent those out months ago.  Another friend chimed in saying ""mannnnnn, I can't even begin to comprehend how insane it is to handle that many people at your wedding, you must be going insane, what's the guest list at...like 1500?""  Again not paying attention, i was like nooooooo closer to 1200 at which point I saw Rachel's eyes bug out and my sanity kicked in and we all changed the subject.


This morning, Steve lights up my phone with a ""dude, did you seriously not invite us to your wedding?  Rachel is super upset that you didn't invite us, and after you didn't even get us a wedding gift"".  Andy called a few hours later with a ""I thought we were closer than that? You have a HUGE wedding and you couldn't invite us? That hurts...""  We talked for a few minutes and I mentioned I was out running errands and that I would talk to him later. Same with Steve.


Honestly, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for NOT inviting them.  It sucks, but it is also somewhat offensive that they feel entitled to attend my wedding or claim that I didn't give t hem a wedding gift...when I was not invited, and STILL took them out to expensive and fancy dinner's (100+ a head) to celebrate.


I would like to not damage the relationships as much as possible, but at the same time I'm trying to find out how to approach them properly with why I didn't invite them.


   
**tl;dr**: Didn't invite 2 pairs of close friends to my wedding because they did not invite me to theirs.  In my culture not inviting someone to your wedding can be seen as a huge and deeply personal slight.

First I want to clarify something from my first post that I really did not spell out very well, it doesn't have any real baring on anything but for some reason it bugs me that I made this part sort of murky.

The maid of honor (not my wife) was married to the groomsman who my wife walked down the aisle with.  There were some people who felt my wife was trying to arrange the dance but I do know for fact that this part was legit, however it doesn't mean she didn't try and offer to let them dance or any other form of manipulation but I just wanted to try and clear that part up a little.

I'm here because I have gotten honest to God over 40 request for an up date since last week.  Thank you for your guys concern on this and I wish I had some really ballsy statement to make about how I stood tall and kicked her to the curb but sadly that is just not what happened.

To be blunt I'm in limbo.  

There have been developments but all they have done is make it harder for me to decide.  Last week I was mostly angry then as the weekend progressed I became mostly sad.  I want to be able to hate her and flip that switch that tells me I'm being walked on and am a sucker but it's just very hard for me to do that because I still love her and this is ripping me apart.

Here is what has happened of any consequence.  She finally came to the realization that I was not going to just get over this.  This then brought her to the realization that I might want out of the marriage.  This then brought on a near nervous breakdown from her.

Someone (hell a lot) from the first post stated that she would try and manipulate me like that and believe me I was taking those words to heart when I thought she was having crocodile tears.  But it soon became apparent to me that she wasn't acting or faking, she was having a legitimate panic attack.  This led to an E.R. visit and that led to an overnight stay in the Hospital and then to new medications and a scheduled follow up with her Doctor for later next week.

This brought her family into it and that in turn led to long conversations all the way around.

When we got home (with her family in tow) I asked what she wanted to do since there was a house full of people and she said she wanted to be with her Mom for awhile.

That was fine with me as I had no desire to hang around all day with her Dad or Sister so I said I was going to go finish up something at work and would be home later.

Two hours after I get there I get a text from her begging me to please come home and that she really needs me to talk with her.

So I finish up what I was doing and head home.  I am greeted on my own front porch by her Dad who asks if he can talk to me for a minute.  My anger level was already somewhat high but I was ready to go to war if she had dumped a shit sack of lies on me with her Dad.  I mean its not like he and I are best friends and shit but I've never had a bad moment with him so I really wasn't going to be happy about being the bastard who broke his baby's heart.

We set on our deck chairs and he fucking floored me with his opening salvo.  I was expecting to hear anything but what he said.

He said that she told them what had happened and that he wanted to apologize to me because he said that he felt like he did a really shitty job as a parent and that this mindset that she had was really a creation of her mothers and that while he loved both of them he said they were wrong and he had told his wife years ago that telling the girls that whatever happens before marriage doesn't count was a horrible idea and value system to install in them.

He then said that he wasn't there to stand up for what his daughter did but he just wanted me to be aware that what she was saying and how she was acting was simply because she honestly believed that being married was an entirely different life and that they (Mom & Dad) had romanticized marriage to the point that she wasn't understanding real life.

Basically he was kind of throwing his wife under the bus but again this is not what I was expecting at all.

We shook hands and he said that no matter what I decided he still thought very highly of me, which honestly made me feel really good for that moment.

I then went inside and my wife is curled up in a ball on her Mom's lap and you can tell she has been crying the entire time I've been gone.  Mom gets up and comes and hugs me and tells me she is sorry and that she loves me and she is praying that we can work this out.

My wife is laid out on the couch at this point.  Her Mom and Dad leave and she sits there looking at me and crying.

Ok, this is where I'm going to piss off everybody and just tell you that I couldn't take it.  I went to her and we hugged for a long time with her telling me over and over how sorry she was.  

Hey I know it was the weak thing to do but again I have to say in my defense that just before this incident occurred I loved her with all of my heart and would have done anything to not see her in pain, whatever she had done I still didn't want to see her like that.

Look it's very possible that she was putting on an Oscar worthy acting job, but I don't honestly think so.  She really seemed broken at that point in time.

After awhile when she calmed down I asked her what she wanted me to come home and talk about and she said she wanted to get everything out in the open so I didn't feel like I was being lied to or manipulated.

So she wanted me to ask her questions and I wish I had written down a list but I came up with a few off the top of my head.

She was brutally honest with me and some of the questions I asked I probably shouldn't have because now the mental image is stuck in there but honestly it was there anyway I just now have confirmation.

First I asked for dates or at the very least approximate dates (I didn't tell her about the engagement concern I had because I didn't want her to change story's) and she remembered exactly when they occurred.  Fortunately this happened a little earlier in our relationship than she told me initially and so we were not engaged when this happened.  I can't tell you what a relief that was because I became physically ill when I thought about that when someone said it in my last post.

Second I asked how many times.  She went over board with this because instead of just telling me how many different dates she decided to tell me how many times there was penetration (she wasn't doing it to be mean she honestly thought that is what I wanted to know).  This part of the conversation did not help me any at all and in fact almost broke me down.  In truth it wasn't that often and in fact there were really only 3 different days it happened on but there were several times during those three days.

Then came the hard part.  Why did she do it?  Okay again I'm not the most manly of men and I am ashamed to admit this but I couldn't get this out without starting to cry.  I asked why wasn't I good enough, why him, why did she not just leave me.  It was her turn to hold me because at this point everything came rushing at me.  Her telling me, me having to watch them laugh with each other, her now telling me how many times they did it and where they did it.

She talked during this but to this moment I have no idea what she said.  I was to upset and honestly nothing she was going to say was going to make a bit of difference anyway.

But after I composed myself I simply told her that the betrayal was horrible but honestly her response to me when I found out was just as bad if not worse.  

She agreed with me and she apologized for calling me immature.  She said that she honestly believed that it wouldn't matter to me now because we were married (when she said this my blood started to boil again).  I started to say something about it but she jumped in and said that after talking with her parents she now sees that this was very wrong of her and that cheating is cheating but she still feels like that our happiness that we have shared since being married should count for something.  I then replied that I kind of felt like that happiness was built on a lie.

This led to another break down on her part and almost another E.R. visit.  But between Ativan and having her breath into a paper sack we got her calmed down.

I let her sleep the rest of the night feeling like emotionally we were both tired but come Sunday we were talking again.

By this time I wasn't as sympathetic as I had been when we got home from the E.R.  I told her that I thought her introducing him to me was shitty, me having to watch her dance with him was extra shitty and the fact that she only told me because she was going to get caught was an elite level of shitty.

Which then I demanded to know why did she think I would find out and how many of the fucking people at the wedding knew besides me.  Well obviously the guy knew, but then his best friend in the world also knew (did I mention that fucker is now my brother in law) which then led to her sister finding out and she was afraid her sister was going to be the one to tell me.

I asked how often she see's this guy and she said that the wedding is the first time she has seen him in 3 years.

Then I lost my shit and asked her if she fucked him during any of the lead up to the wedding.  She got all pissy about it acting like she wouldn't fuck anyone because she was married and I just lost my shit and had to leave for awhile because once again I felt like she was living on ""Married Planet"" or some such shit and the world there is a different place than for the rest of us.

I finally got cooled off enough to come home and try and be civil about things.

She finally asked me what she could do to help me get past all of this, which may not sound like much but it was the first time she offered to help me really so it was at least a nice gesture.

I told  her I wasn't sure what she could do or if there was anything either of us could do and that I may never get over this.

She said that she wanted to help because she didn't want to see me in pain and that over the years she hopes I'll be able to judge her based on who she is now.  She would do anything I wanted to work this out.  She also wanted to be sure that I knew that she has been 100% faithful since we've been married and would never cheat on her vows.  I sarcastically thanked her (which I admit wasn't the most mature thing to do).
   
I then asked for a moratorium from further talks till at least Wednesday.  I have two projects I have to get done and honestly I'm just exhausted and no I have no fucking clue what I want to do.  I shift between periods of red hot anger where I want to kick her out and then periods of deep emotional turmoil where I want to just forget this and move forward with her.

Yes I know this is not what anyone wanted to hear and no I'm not proud to type it but it is what it is at the moment.

So much so that my best friend Jules (23f) asked me to make her cookies for her Christmas party. There are going to be about 40 people there. It is in honor of her grandmother (60f) who won a local award for her charity. 

Jules paid for all the cookies to be made and for a nice platter for them to go on. She also paid me 'labor' to do it (Starbucks gift cards and dinner). I would have done it for free, but Jules knows my love of sushi and coffee. 

I spent 8 hours cooking. 

My aunt came by with my mother to visit. She saw the platter of cookies and was excited. She tried to take them, but I told her they were for Jules and that I was paid to make them, so they were being picked up in an hour. Which is true. 

However, my aunt got upset and left. 

I don't remember this, at all, because it was in passing a month ago. I guess she mentioned over a family dinner that my cousin (11) had a bake sale and she would like people to help out. She never brought it up again, never said anything to me specifically, even though I am the baker in the family. 

I assumed she would pick up some cookies at the store and sell those. 

She assumed that I made 400+ cookies for her daughter, with no prior info, money handed over (I can't afford to buy nice ingedients like this in bulk), or even planning.

Now my aunt is furiously keyboard bitching about it online and thinks I should spend all of Sunday making her daughter cookies as a forgiveness present. She wants me to hand out the cash, cancel important plans (yes, seeing Krumpus is super important to me) to make cookies without any reward for it. 

If I planned to sell cookies I would just sell them myself, keep the profits, and go from there. Jules has been the sister I never had, grew up with me, and made me feel amazing when my boyfriend broke up with me. Her grandmother is my 3rd granny and I am close with their family. I will be at the party tonight to honor her. 

I am not missing that, plans, or working 8 hours again so some kids can raise money for their soccer team.

I read all the comments from last thread including the ones I didn't reply to. There were some strong points made and it got me thinking.

I talked to my fiance about best man and his wife. It took some digging to get the truth out of her--she is not very political or vocal about social issues and clearly didn't want to discuss them. I talked to her one night, hit a wall, gave up and tried again a week later. It finally came out that best man and his wife have expressed opinions about her that I was not aware of. Among other things, topics mentioned were:

1. how Asians are 'taking over' American universities in some places and how this should be curbed

2. how our mixed race kids are going to be confused about their identity and that children should have a 'unified' nuclear family

3. how her parents speak with an accent. Even though both of my fiance's parents are highly educated professionals and their English is pretty darn good especially considering they learned it in their 30s.

As well as some other less savory stuff not specific to east Asians.

So, it turns out a lot of the comments were correct in speculating that my best friend and his wife were secretly a lot more bigoted than they let on in front of me. It was shocking everything my fiance told me came out of their mouths when I wasn't around, but at the same time...I'm not completely surprised. Throughout our entire friendship I have kind of just willfully ignored the aspects of his beliefs that made me uncomfortable and prided myself on being able to stay friends with someone who didn't share the same opinions as me.

About a month before the wedding I asked my cousin to step up to be best man. It was kind of half assed--this cousin is not super close to me, but he was the only male relative I could ask. It didn't go over too well, but my fiance and I were both more relaxed at the wedding than we would have been otherwise.

Some time after the wedding we were talking about my friend, and my wife came clean with one more thing. He had hit on her pretty aggressively at several points in the past, and one of these incidents happened when I was out of state for a while. This was while he was with his wife.

I cut contact with both of them after that. I told him why, and left it to him to explain to his wife, if he does.

tl;dr: The wedding happened. Pulled family rank to get my cousin to replace friend as best man. We are no longer in contact with former best friend and his wife. My former best friend's preaching of 'family values' turns out to be a load of hypocritical bullshit.

784,bfmakingfunofmethrow,Relationships,6zwi03,1781,"EDIT: this blew up in a way i didn't expect. i want to answer everyone and i'll try to but to clear some things up:

i don't think my boyfriend was snooping. i always clear my history out of habit and this time i left it there. it most likely came up in the search bar since he told me he just 'found it there.'

the problem here is not my sense of humour, it's the fact that when i told him i wrote fics and came clean about it, i was laughing with him. then the mockery started and for the next few days, i was a crazed fangirl in his eyes and he wouldn't let go. that is not having a sense of humour, that's someone i love being hurtful towards me on purpose even though i told him to knock it off.

we're currently not talking. he thinks i'm being over sensitive and i'm here reading your replies. i haven't let him come to my house yet and won't until i think of something to tell him. i already have something in my head thanks to you guys.

this is the first time i see my boyfriend acting this way. i wouldn't be with him if he had been like this since the start. this is the first time and it's probably why i'm so shocked here. i'm hurt. a joke or two, fine. straight up mean mockery? nope.

i don't know if he got jealous, i don't know if the content of the stories bothered him, i don't know. i plan on finding out though.

---
EDIT 2: i'm meeting with him later today, we're gonna talk. 

but again, to clear up any confusion: i did not kick him out completely out of nowhere. he was not confused why i snapped. when he started teasing, it was okay the first couple of times. then he started mocking and reading the fics just to make fun of it. he'd read parts back to me while laughing and making fun of me in a way that wasn't a joke or him seeing me as 'one of the guys'.

i'm a writer. a serious writer who's got her first book published and a few poems that made its way to the local paper.

i make a living out of it.

i also have a very secret blog that i use to publish fanfiction under a pseudonym. i know when we mention fanfiction, the first thing that comes to the mind is that i'm ab obsessed fangirl who writes countless of OCs and all of them are in love with an alter ego of myself and bla bla.

no. i just really like exploring my favorite characters and the universe they live in. if i'm reading a book, playing a game, watching a movie--i sometimes think 'what if'. and i write it out. it's been my secret for a long while now.

it used to be.

my boyfriend found my blog when i forgot to clear out my hystory on my laptop. (i don't hide stuff from him, it's just a habit i picked up since i was a child and  hit that curious about porn phase. we had a family computer and if i didn't clear the history i'd get caught, so i always do this.)

he's been mocking me for it. i'm not fragile, i can take a mocking every now and then if i know it's not really malicious. my boyfriend, on the other hand, keeps laughing and making jokes about me being a 'tumblr girl', about me wanting to be with those characters and so on.

it's to the point he read a few and started nitpicking and making fun of some of it. 

i talked to him, he dismissed me. i finally snapped yesterday when he came over and i was writing (again for the local paper). he said 'writing your weird smut fanfiction, fangirl?'

he meant it as a joke. he laughed but i was already so cranky that i told him to leave. he looked at me puzzled and said he was kidding but i kicked him out.

english's not my native language. i started learning english when i was 9 years old because there was no one to write/read fanfictions of a particular fandom i was into in my native language. 

because of it, i discovered how much i love writing. because of it, i learned english and it saved my life when i needed a job but was inexperienced in a lot of things. but man i could speak and write english fluently. and all thanks to writing fanfiction.

it means a lot to me and i'm not hurt that most people think it's silly and make fun of fanfiction writers. i'm hurt because the boy i love is being horrible about it and i'm this close to breaking up. i don't deserve to be mocked for something i like, especially when i don't judge him with the stuff he likes.

he wants to come over but he doesn't think he's wrong and he doesn't see how his behaviour is hurting me.

what do i do?

i learned a long time ago not to be ashamed of doing something that brings me joy, especially when times are hard enough already. 

but it hurts so much that my bf thinks i'm a loser and i don't know what to do. i'm starting to see him differently.

Since my early 20s, I developed a thorough skin care routine that I use everyday. I enjoy doing it and it?s good for my skin. After I shower at night, I wash my face, moisture and occasionally use a face mask. I also fully moisturize my body, hands and feet. Three times a week, I will use a leave in hair conditioner or hair mask. This routine takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour. I do this in the living room sofa or in the bathroom so that I won?t disturb my SO if he chooses to go to bed early. I?ve been doing this routine for many years, since before we got together and my boyfriend has never had a problem with it until recently. I spend about $200 every few months on skin care products, but I don?t think it?s a lot as I earn enough to be able to afford this and still be able to live comfortably and save 10-15% of my net income every month. 


Lately my SO has been very irritated whenever I leave to do my skincare routine. For example, after we had sex, we cuddled and talked for a while and then I got up to do my skincare routine and he got visibly annoyed and said ?Must you do that shit everyday??. The next day I came home to find some of my skincare products missing and I found them hidden in the closet in his sock drawer. He said he just wanted to see how I would react when I confronted him about it. 


We went to visit his parents for the holidays + vacation and I packed my skin care products with my toiletries. I found out that he took it out and left it at home. I was super upset and had to go out and buy them and he didn?t talk to me unless necessary over the holidays when he found out that I went to buy them. Things have been tense and awkward since we returned. I finally asked him why he was so upset about this and he said that I?m too high maintenance and that is not an attractive quality in a partner. I asked him why he had an issue with it now when he never said anything over the past 3 years. He said that he didn?t think it was an issue in the beginning but he did now. I asked him if he wants to break up with me for being too high maintenance and he said he will leave it up to me to choose.

a) This guy acting really creepy towards my sister

b) My mum acting jealous towards my sister, I think, as a result

A bit of background.  My sister was conceived when my parents were still pretty young (18) and they got married as a result.  I always used to tease my sister back when I was a horrible kid about how she was the accident and I was the planned one.  After they got married, they had a son, me.  Alas, their marriage was not meant to last, and while I think they did truly come to love each other and care for each other through the sharing of two kids, they were ultimately two different people who wanted two different things from life.

My mum wanted to settle down in classic suburbia and have a classic life, my dad was more of an adventurer into travelling across the world and skydiving and what not.  They got divorced while we were quite young, and while it was difficult initially for the pair of us to understand, we never felt unloved and our dad was always there in our life.  He was never neglectful or anything, while our mother was our primary custodian, our dad used to come by quite often and help about.  So while they were divorced, they still had a pretty good relationship, sometimes it was almost like they were dating and I think they did enjoy each others company, but ultimately they were two very different people to be tied down to one another permanently.

Anyhow so my mum's dating this guy (I think he's about the same age as my mum, more or less) that she's actually known for quite some time as an acquaintance.  She knows him from work but they've never been that close and started dating not that long ago, maybe around Christmas last year.

Anyhow she seems quite infatuated with him, but from the start something seemed weird about him.  I don't know if you've ever seen the movie 'American Psycho', but my sister and I love that movie, and we both think this guy is pretty much Patrick Bateman.  Outwardly he's the perfect, chiselled, accomplished business guy; he's charming, polite, almost too charming.

As a son, I might just be naturally suspicious because he's dating my mum, but he always gave me this serial-killery vibe right from the start.  Not saying he's a serial killer, but let's just say it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if I found out he was.  Something just seems unnatural about him, like almost every thing he does, wears, says, is fake and is perfectly calculated to give off the image he wants of himself.  I suppose that's how you have to be to succeed in the business world, but I never liked him, he never struck me as a genuine person.

Anyhow, my mum seemed to be quite infatuated with him, and she seemed really happy with him from the start.  He expressed affection to her quite often and I think she really appreciated that, it made her feel youthful if I had to guess.

Now to get to the root of the issue:  this guy started doing some seriously creepy stuff towards my sister.  At first we didn't say anything, but only my sister and I noticed.

The biggest one was one morning when we were all having breakfast at the table, he was there sitting across from me having his cereal, and my sister was bending over to pick up something, and I saw him look like right at her buttcrack, and then he looked at me and smiled and nodded his head towards her like ""eh?"", giving off a super creepy smile.  My mind was thinking like ""what the fuck...."" but I just ignored it cause I didn't want to make a scene or anything.

I told my sister about it as soon as I had the chance, and she agreed he was really creepy.  She told me sometimes she feels him staring at her, especially from behind.  She told me of a bunch of times he made her feel really uncomfortable, like one time she was brushing her hair in the bathroom and he just came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulder and started having a long conversation with her, which included telling her how nice she smelt.  She told me she'd never felt more uncomfortable in her life.

She said sometimes when she's sitting on the couch watching a movie or tv, he'd come and sit by her and edge closer and put his arm around her, and she'd feel really uncomfortable.  This was in addition to all the times she caught him trying to sneak glances at her.

I also started noticing this, like at the breakfast table, when she was walking past or whatever, he'd start taking quick glances at her from the corner of his eye.

Sometimes when my sister and I are up in her bedroom and watching something on her laptop together or listening to music together, he'd come up and be like ""hey kids, what are ya up to?"" and just sit besides her and put his arm around her, and watch whatever we're watching, and like not leave. At all.

Sometimes I feel like he acts super extra nice to her, more than to me or my mum.  He's way more touchy with her and tries to sit as close to her as he can, taking glances and peaks here and there.

Needless to say we both felt very uncomfortable.  My first suggestion is that we have to tell mum about this.  My sister insisted no, she wouldn't understand, she'd get mad at us for suggesting, we can't tell her.  I insisted she has to know that this dude was creeping on her daughter, and eventually my sister relented and she agreed.  We went and told our mum, but she just laughed it off and told us we were being paranoid and ignored the whole thing.  He seems to really have her under his spell.


However, this is where the second problem began.  We both noticed right after we told her this, and we think she started becoming more aware of the way he was acting, a weird change in our mother's behaviour.  First of all, she started acting almost more ""possessive"" of her boyfriend, almost like she was trying to ""claim"" him.  Not sure what other words to use, but that's what it seemed like to me.  She would suddenly be much more affectionate to him when he was around, like trying to kiss him more often, giving him hugs, being more cuddly with him and smiling around him, calling him more pet names.  Almost like she was trying to 'mark her territory' and show that he was hers and she was his.

Its crazy to think but I think its cause she was starting to feel almost jealous or threatened by her daughter, she was scared of the fact that he might be more interested in her daughter than in her.  I personally think she was becoming more aware of him acting creepy around my sister and taking stares and glances at her, which is what made her more nervous.  She was being more lovey around him, trying to bring him closer to her, they started going to bed 'early' if you know what I mean, and sometimes being disturbingly loud in the bedroom, though not that often, thank heavens.

The other thing is she started acting jealous towards my sister, and like policing her behaviour and dress.  For example, she started telling my sister off if her pyjamas or nightwear or whatever were too revealing, especially if it was a night that her boyfriend was staying the night at our place.  And she started insisting that my sister wear a bra at home, which really, really annoyed my sister for some reason.  She was like ""no way, I never wear a bra at home"", cause normally she just wears a loose grey jumper or a loose grey shirt when she's at home, that isn't even remotely revealing or anything.  My mum said its inappropriate that she doesn't wear a bra under her clothes, and she was also like ""you're grown up now, you need to wear one"" but my sister said it was uncomfortable to wear one all the time and sleep in one, and she liked to relax when she's at home and not have to worry about that.  But now it seems that our mum was making her worry about that.  She was also policing other things she wore, like ordinary clothes, and told her not wear a towel around the house when she comes out of the shower.  She was like ""wtf why?'  and my mum was like, ""we have two males in this house, your brother and my boyfriend, its inappropriate"" which is weird as fuck given that I'd lived in this house with them all my life and she'd never had a problem with it before.  Also, when like my sister comes and bends over the couch to see what I'm doing, my mum would be like ""dear, stand properly"" or ""sit properly, that's not very lady like"".  Sometimes she'd do it even on nights when her boyfriend wasn't around, but it was mostly when her boyfriend was around which indicated that the boyfriend was the real reason she was acting more policey and insecure.  Sometimes the boyfriend wouldn't even be in the vicinity; like, my sister and I would be upstairs in her bedroom watching something, and my mum would come in and check on us and see what we're doing, then she'd be like ""sweetie, I told you to wear a bra more often"".

Needless to say, its been annoying the fuck out of my sister.  She's been getting massively annoyed and distressed by the whole thing.  Its bad enough to have this total creep creep on her all the time he's over, but now her own mother is clamping down on her and acting like a jealous insecure teenage girl towards her own daughter.  I can't even begin to imagine how much its bothering her.

She's talked to me a lot about it, and she's told me how sick she is of all of it and how sick she is of living in this house.  She told me she feels like she's not even safe in her own home any more, she feels like she's being watched constantly, and she hates being alone with this guy.  We tried telling our mother about it already but she brushed it off.

My sister suggested we go live with our dad instead since we're both adults, but I told her I don't think it would be too conducive to his lifestyle.  He seems to like living on his own and having two teenage brats in the way would hamper that.  I told her nevertheless we should tell him about what's going on, and maybe he can help.

She immediately insisted no no no, we shouldn't tell him, we shouldn't involve him in this.  I tried to reason and convince her but she was totally against telling dad.  Now this is the part where I feel bad, especially since I might show this post and the replies to her later (sorry sis), but I did tell dad.  I had to. Sorry, really sorry.

I made my dad promise to not let her know that I'd told him, but he gave me advice and told me to watch out for this guy.  He told us to keep our distance and when the time is right, he might have a chat with our mother about it.  He also told me if I ever see him put one inappropriate hand on his daughter in an inappropriate place or anything, or try to make a move on her or anything, that I immediately tell him.  He was like he knows these sort of guys, guys who think they can easily prey on young and naive girls who are still too scared to properly stick up for themselves.

I told my dad about my sister wanting to move in with him, he was like maybe for one of us, but not both, at least not permanently.  I told my sister about that, she was like she didn't want to leave me alone here, she thought if we move out, we should both move out together and she felt safer having me around any way.  I told her I'd be fine on my own, but she was quite insistent.  She suggested maybe looking for a place where we could both move out to and rent together, but I was like, nah, I'm not too interested in that.  I kinda like living at home with mum, its comfy as hell and I have someone to look after me.  She tried insisting, she seemed to think it was the only solution to getting out of this environment, but I said I'd consider it, but honestly I'm not keen on moving out at all. I have nothing against her moving out if she wants to though, but she seems pretty keen that I move out to.

So yeah, thats the story.  Two main issues:

a) Mum's boyfriend is creeping on and acting really weird towards my sister, making her constantly uncomfortable and unsafe when he's around.  We've tried telling our mum, but she brushed it off.  What can we do to stop this creeping and make my sister feel safe?

b) Mum herself started acted strange and jealous towards my sister, policing what she wears and how she acts much more strictly to try to not draw attention to her from her boyfriend.  Its been really annoying my sister and getting on her nerves, how can we get this behaviour to stop?

One last thing. My sister doesn't use reddit, but she knows of it.  I've considered showing her this post and showing her the replies I get, in case they are of any use to her.  Do you guys think this is a good idea? If so post advice to her as well.

During the early years  of our marriage we decided to foster kids in need and during that time has a girl come into our care at 15 and after a short period, ended up with her full time. Obviously during the initial years we struggled with the normal teenager issues, but grew and accepted her as part of our family and called her our daughter [22F] and called us mum and dad. During the initial 6 years, our family hit some road bumps, but we made it through OK and our daughter had two wonderful children which my wife and I adore. My wife and daughter always had a good relationship and often shared times of coffee, lunch and movies.

Roughly 12 months ago our daughter starting seeing her new boyfriend [29M]. During the initial stages my wife and the daughters boyfriend became close friends due to a number of reasons including the boyfriend needing an understanding person as he had gone through the loss of his own daughter. 

The friendship between my wife and the daughters boyfriend caused a lot of issues to my daughter. My wife and daughters boyfriend starting doing a number of things, including coffee, movies etc. behind my daughters back and without telling the daughter. Further to this the boyfriend would often not tell the daughter what was happening, or only tell her after the fact or tell her that my wife & I liked him more. This caused major issues and I tried to get both the wife and daughters boyfriend to communicate what they were doing and why to the daughters, but this did not resolve any issues. This lead to a range of accusations from the daughter including that both the wife and boyfriend were having an affair, that my wife traded her in for a new friend.

It initially came to a head last year where the daughter openly said to me that my wife and her boyfriend has sex, even though both strongly denied this. At this time my wife did not want anything to do with our daughter and after a 3-4 weeks period we decided to undertake counselling in an effort to resolve the issue and put them in the past and move forward. After many sessions we all felt better and looked to the future to build a stronger family.

After Christmas and boxing day, the allegations started again from the daughter based on alleged comments from my wife to the boyfriend about sex. Both my wife and the daughters boyfriend do not recall discussing sex or even asking the other person for sex. This lead to more accusations from the daughter about lies, affairs etc. etc. This lead to the daughter sending my wife a text message which was pretty bad and including stating our daughter hating my wife, she was having an affair and numerous other allegations. My wife was at wits end and simply replied goodbye and has cut all ties with our daughter.

During the past 12 months  I have tried to highlight to my wife that she is playing with the daughters feelings and cannot keep running around behind her back and to open and upfront, I have told the daughter to dump the boyfriend as he has played games with all of us and was destroying the family and told her to stop bring up the past after this being resolved in counselling, and I told the boyfriend what he was doing to our family.

During this whole time I have been stuck in the middle and tried to get everyone to understand what was happening. 

My and my wife's relationship was always good, but I have noticed we have drifted apart over recent times and during a break my wife had away and realized my love had dwindled for my wife. 

Yesterday my wife turned around and said we she wants to get us back on track and stated either I have nothing to do with may daughter or she will leave me. I found this astonishing given the fact that I have been an innocent person in this and not sure how getting back on track will be achieved by dictating terms and creating more hurt for me by losing my daughter.

Yes I would like to repair my relationship with my wife, but also want a daughter and grandchildren in my life. I'm lost and do not know what to do.

George and I have been together for a long time now. He?s going to propose to me this summer after I graduate (I went back to college for a second degree), we?re planning our wedding and honeymoon, designing our future house, and we talk about the child we want to have someday. I think it?s pretty safe to say things are serious between us, and we?re deeply in love.

However, things have not been so easy for us in the past. Our combined anxiety has caused a lot of grief for us. I?m still struggling with being abandoned and left to fend for myself as a child, and he?s struggling with deep fears from past abuse by his father, brother, and ex-wife, who were all mentally and physically abusive.

Understand that George is *so* sweet and loving. He does his best to help me and encourage me any way he can, and it?s clear to me that he wants me to succeed and be happy. But with George it?s like a Jekyll-Hyde thing. Sometimes I can?t even believe my wonderful boyfriend could swap so quickly.

When he asked for a pre-nup, I understood: his ex stole everything he owned and left him homeless for months. When he gets nervous and withdrawn in response to my stress, I get it: his dad was abusive whenever something stressful happened. 

And maybe it?s just my own anxiety, but things are starting to get precarious for me.

About once every 2 weeks he asks me if I?m cheating. His ex cheated on him multiple times. Sometimes he just randomly asks, ?Are you cheating?? and I?ve been patient because I understand how anxiety can be. I make sure to always show him who I?m texting and snapchatting, and I let him answer my texts when he hears the tone, and see my call logs. Other times it gets more serious. Some months ago he announces that he *knows* I?m cheating, because he found, in the trash, a carryout bag and the remnants of a dinner for two from a restaurant he?d never been to. I point out that it was from the week prior when I?d gone to a caf? to meet my sister, and I let the leftovers go bad and just threw them out. But it?s only after I show him an Instagram picture of the meal and a pic of me and my sister from the same place that he believes me.

Another time, he says he *knows* (he uses that word) I?m cheating because he saw a picture on Meetme of me in my underwear in somebody else?s house. I ask him to show me the picture, and he says it?s already been deleted, and admits it was just from the shoulders-down. I invite him to look at every piece of underwear that I own to see if it looked familiar. He admitted, after searching, that the woman had been wearing a black bra, and he remembered I don?t own one of those because I like white shirts and they always show underneath. After he remembered, he calmed down.

This last time was the most serious of all. I?ve been stressed due to midterms this past week, and I?ve been nonstop studying in the library. I always study in the same place, by a window in the library, and he?s come along and brought me food and helped me study. When I?m stressed, I can get pretty withdrawn, especially when I?ve got a lot to do. I noticed he was getting more and more nervous about it, which cumulated (I thought) in my accidentally spilling water off my nightstand and swearing up a storm. I said over and over again that it had nothing to do with him, NOTHING was directed at him, he wasn?t even in the room at the time, but he accused me of taking out my stress on him. After that he was extremely withdrawn and moody.

The next day I was boxing things up to send back home to my parents, and I hear music suddenly blaring from the kitchen and I find George in there cooking dinner, which is something we always do together. I?m in a good mood and I try to join him but he doesn?t let me. He keeps saying that I need to stop being rude to him. I had apologized for every wrong he cited against me, but he maintained that he was just tired of my behavior and, in my mind, it felt like he was deliberately holding on to those past wrongs. This eventually leads to a pretty huge fight, where I shout at him that he?s making my life hell right now on top of all my other stress, and he calls me a cunt and a stupid bitch. I respond by calling him a childish asshole. He runs out the door to go buy cigs down the block, and I leave too, and head back to the library. I stay there until 2AM, studying.

When I get home, the first thing I notice is that the front window is shattered. This scares the shit out of me. George has thrown things and broken things before (never at me, never my stuff), so I was afraid of what kind of mood he was in. I go inside and he?s still awake, waiting for me. I don?t say anything to him, it?s very late, I?m tired, and I have an exam in the morning, so I take a shower to help me sleep, I change into my PJs and prepare a bed on the couch, because I don?t want to be near him. As I?m settling in, he walks in and demands to know why ?there?s fresh cum? on my panties. I can?t even believe what I?m hearing. He shows me my panties, and it?s SO ridiculous, because he *knows* I?d been dealing with a yeast infection these past few days, which causes white discharge, and requires white-ish medication. The stuff on my panties is so obviously not cum, but he absolutely believes it is.

So we fight. I bring up the yeast infection and he seems to realize that I?m right because he immediately abandons that argument and switches to how I?ve been ?disrespecting? him this past week, and he won?t stand for it anymore. I ask how I?ve been disrespecting him. He brings up how I didn?t walk him out of the library the times he?s joined me there. I point out that he always needs to leave before I?m done studying, so I want to stay and keep studying, and I think that?s reasonable. He says I?m ungrateful for his bringing me food and flash-cards in the library. I say that I do remember thanking him, and he finally admits that he?s ?grasping at straws? but that he *does* feel disrespected. I say that it?s his anxiety, and I ask him to please realize that, I try to remind him that we?re best friends and we love each other, and I would never do anything to try and hurt him, but he snidely tells me to go talk to my therapist about it (he doesn?t believe in therapy). He won?t stop yelling until I hide under the covers, plug my ears, and start crying. Then he shouts that I?m ?not a victim? and leaves me alone finally, but my anxiety keeps me up all night, and I end up failing one of my tests the next day because I?m *so* tired and my eyes are so grainy from crying. 

By the next afternoon we?re back on speaking terms. He admits that he knew there wasn?t cum on my panties, because he drove by the library a few times and saw me studying there in the window where I always study. I feel very nervous about this because I realize that even with definitive proof, with his own eyes, that I didn?t do anything wrong, he still went ahead and accused me.

Recently we watched *Horns* together, and I mentioned that I thought it was unrealistic how the best friend became a psychopath out of nowhere. I thought, given they?d known him his whole life, there would have been *some* signs that indicated he was crazy, and his friends would?ve had a hunch. George said he wasn?t surprised: he said that he believed *anyone* could snap and become a rapist/murderer out of nowhere, and people could hide their true intentions no matter how well you think you know them. He cited the time his sister-in-law (married to his abusive brother) tried to strangle him out of nowhere.

I know he?s very distrustful of everyone, so I understand why he said that, but still, it made me afraid.

The last few days have been *so* difficult for me. I already feel very sick to my stomach with nerves. I brought up what he said about *Horns*, and kind of half-jokingly asked if he was going to kill me. He says no but that he does sometimes imagine ?punching me in the face.? I tell him I sometimes think of punching him, too, but I would never actually do that, and he should never do that either because I will leave. He just laughs and says he won?t, and I think the conversation is over, except he suddenly says, ?If you cheated on me, I think I?d be angry enough to try and kill you, and probably succeed.? I respond by saying I would probably be angry enough to kill him if he cheated, but I wouldn?t actually hurt him. He doesn?t really have a response for that.

Yesterday he said it again. I mentioned how one of my friends and her now-husband went celibate for their entire engagement period (1-year). He casually responds, ?That sounds horrible. I think if I had to go more than two weeks without sex I?d probably freak out and kill you.? This made my stomach do a flip-flop because it was the second time in two days. I say something like ?You know I won?t be able to have sex for like, 6 weeks after I give birth, right? Even if it?s cesarean, because I need to recover from surgery.? He doesn?t say anything and that freaks me the fuck out, so I press him, ?You *know* that, right?? and he says, ?Well it?s gonna be tough.?

Things are spiraling out of control for me. I know I often don?t think straight because of my GAD but I?m not happy with how things are going. I want to tell him not to accuse me of cheating anymore, that I?ve more than proven myself to him, and that we can?t fight like this anymore, and he needs to STOP saying anything about killing me because even if he?s joking it makes me sick to my stomach, but now I?m a little afraid that if I pick a fight about this, he?s going to think that I?m cheating and trying to cover it up somehow. Further, I?m worried that if I can?t account for every minute we?re apart (like cameras following me everywhere) then one day, if my phone dies, or if I get stuck in traffic, or if some male coworker greets me inappropriately against my will, George will believe I?m cheating and possibly kill me?

I'm pregnant with a baby girl (25 weeks) and both me and my partner are very excited (we planned for the her too ^_^ ), here's the problem though, when we found out we were having a girl my partner (29M - let's call him Mike) has been set on a certain name. This is the name of the girl he was infatuated with through most of high school and a bit of college (16 -19 years old ish) and though they stayed friends she didn't reciprocate his feeling (let's call her Susan - all name are changed). 

Now Mike says is likes the name Susan due to it being nice, not due to the connection with the high school crush, and that even if he did, he respects her a lot, which could be true but I don't really like the name anyway and the whole thing makes me kinda uncomfortable. The name is also quite rare and neither of us know anyone else, bar her with that name (should also add we met in college and have been going out since he was 20). 

Anyway, I suggested using the name as a middle name and use a first name that we both like as a first name, but he shot me down. 

He then suggest that I name the next child, which I don't really like the idea of because a) there may not be anymore children and b) if there are I don't want to have favourites before they even born, I want everyone to be on a level playing field. 

This is our daughter and I'm willing to be flexible about all aspects of her life depending on what she wants when she's older, but this, her name is something me and my partner should choose together, I want to love it or at least like is since I'll be using it from the day she born til the day I die or if she chooses to change it. 

I've told him that it makes me uncomfortable but he says those feelings are unfounded.

Am I being unreasonable to want to discuss other names? Should I let it slide and see if the name grows on me?

Hello /r/relationships once again, 

I did not expect my post to get this much attention, to be honest, I got completely overwhelmed with the outpouring of support I have received and would like to warmly thank all those who commented and sent PMs. This is a throwaway, so it was difficult to keep juggling between this account and my main one. 

____________

Here is the update: 

Before I submitted this, I already knew I had to talk to Kara about all of this. Most of you encouraged me and gave me pointers as to how to proceed. However, I really did not want to see her/talk to her. Instead of giving her the silent treatment, I was a bit cold and stiff. I was extremely nervous because I did not want to bring it up and blow up in anger or turn it into a fight. Kara started noticing something was seriously up, and she started pressing it. I told her I'd take her for a drive to talk it all out. 

I took her for a drive that evening. She was starting to act a little cool herself and as soon as I started talking (before getting to the gift issue), she cut me off and told me I'd been giving her hell through out the past week. She started telling me she did not like ""detached"" me. I told her to wait and please let me continue and hear me to the end. 

So I talked. I told her everything calmly, rationally, and nearing the end, I broke down and got very angry/emotional. She kept completely shut, and held my hand, patted my back,... She then told she preferred not to answer, because any answer she'd give me ""would never be good enough"". I told her I saw no logic in giving away instantly such a thought-out meaningful gift. She thought I was mad because of the money, and the argument derivated on that for a while. 

I kept telling her that her unwillingness to say anything beyond a bland ""I'm sorry"" over and over was frustrating me. She finally caved in and told me she had felt ""pressured"" by the prom-organization committee because she hadn't contributed enough this year to this organization. Between work, us, her social life, her hobbies and other charitable organizations, she found herself contributing less (understandable). She wanted to make a significant donation to appease the prom-organization committee who were already running into other troubles. She said one of her friends kept talking about how wonderful that gift was. I felt betrayed. I told her I felt unappreciated, and low on her priority list. 

She hasn't stopped apologizing. She thought I'd be happy that a gift I gave her would make such a significant donation. When I asked her about why she felt the need to give away the significant pieces (custom necklace and box), she said she'd forgot and was too embarrassed to ask back for them. I told her about the selfie text and how she responded to me by lying, and she said she meant that I'd get to see an unfortunate girl wear it and be happy, not her.

I told her I needed to think this through, because I felt my feelings and thoughtfulness did not seem to be sufficiently appreciated. Kara is a forgetful person, and I have to remind her of many things, which I just took as a character trait I'd accept. But I never thought she was careless and/or oblivious. 

I talked to this about many of my friends (not common friends, but my friends who have met her before), and they seem dumbfounded by her behavior and attitude. We're currently on a break, but she keeps calling and texting and I'm doing my best not to answer. I just don't know what to say and am simmering in my hurt. I might be able to pick myself up and move on from this incident and get back to our relationship normally, but I'm too hurt and raw right now. 

I don't have any particular questions, but if anyone has any advice I would gladly take it.

But she and I don?t share the same values when it comes to fashion and beauty. She only buys secondhand clothes, doesn?t wear makeup, and is passive aggressive about my clothes by always suggesting I go to Goodwill. It?s not just me, either?she frequently calls her own daughter?s style ?ridiculous? and is also constantly suggesting Goodwill to her. She thinks the beauty industry is shallow and damaging to women. I don?t entirely disagree, but I do like to indulge in feeling pretty. I plan to feel absolutely beautiful on my wedding day.

My parents and sister are flying in to go wedding dress shopping with me, which is something I?ve dreamed about for years. I loved shopping with them for my sister?s wedding dress and thought it was a lot of fun and really special to indulge in all of the frivolousness. Idk, it was just fun bonding and I?m ready for it again.

I never planned on having MIL there simply because I didn?t think she would care, but she?s made a comment about wanting to have a hand in planning since she and her husband are paying for our rehearsal dinner (as is tradition). She?s already asked where I want to book appointments and has said she can take the day off. So it seems like she wants to be a part of my trying on dresses. However, I?m really worried that she will vocalize her disapproval of my style and make rude and tacky comments about prices or the wedding industry in general to the stylists. There is also some enmity between her and my parents because they clash politically and religiously, and I know my dad likely won?t hold back if she makes passive aggressive or outright rude comments to me.

Basically, I?m just worried I won?t get that family experience I've always wanted if she comes. Is there a way to politely say this is a family-only thing? Or is that out the window now that?s she?s a part of my family, too?

793,Jiltedformervirgin,Updates,3ku2u5,1761,"After 6 months I'm coming back to update this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2zawwe/update_stood_up_by_date_8_hours_after_losing/

Tl;dr of original: I had sex for the first time with a guy I was casually dating. He had trouble with his erection and orgasm.  He stood me up the next night (as i blew up his phone)

Tl;dr of update: he apologized offered to give it another try, I declined. We parted in good terms.

It's been six months since my v-card debacle. Thank you to everyone here for posting about my emotional immaturity. You guys were right. I realized my initial freak-out reaction wasn't helpful. I also realized that my attitude about dating and sex was seriously warped. I imposed a moritorium on all dating activities and went to counseling. I wanted to find out why I was struggling with dating and when I did date I picked inappropriate men.  I had a lot of bad religion to shed and transition out of. I feel like my attitude towards dating and relationships and honestly, myself, comes now from a much healthier place. 

About three months ago I started seeing a really great guy. He lives on the same block and we met at the dog park one day (walking our dogs). He is a lot of fun to be with and has been a wonderful boyfriend. Yes, we do have sex! Of course, the first time was super awkward. I explained that I didn't have a lot of experience (without getting into the crazy story) and he was really wonderful with it. Learning has been a lot of fun and it really has been much better than that first time with the other guy.

Now - the other guy. Keith, as I named him in my PP, has come out as a full douchebag. We parted in good terms and I figured it was case closed.  I was wrong. He started dating a work acquaintance of mine (same company, same building, totally different departments) not too long after the incident. We were chatting in the break room one day and after the usual ""books look pretty good this quarter"" chit chat she said: ""you used to go out with Keith, right?"" I told her I did. She said ""oh, wow, so you're the crazy girl who called constantly when he was out with his friends? "" I stared at her with a puzzled look on my face.  ""Keith told me all about this girl who called him like 20 times in one night and how she was so crazy he just had to call it off.""  She was actually confrontational about it, which I thought was weird. I'm guessing she was trying to mark her territory or something? Wanting to diffuse the situation I said: ""yea, we had one really weird weekend with a lot of miscommunication and a lot of bad decisions on both sides. Don't you hate having to learn life lessons like that? Anyway, glad you guys are happy! "" then I just scooted back to my desk. 

Note: I did unblock him from social media after that first week of counseling. My counselor suggested that I not hide from my past and work to accept it. Unblocking him was part of that - but not re-adding him, does that make sense?

Anyway, back to the office, where I'm on a conference call - and a text comes from a number I don't recognize. The message said ""why in the world are you talking shit about me to my girlfriend? Can't you just stfu?"" I quickly text back: ""sorry, you must have the wrong person.  Check your number again"". Then back to the call. Another txt comes in. It's Keith!  I'd deleted him from my phone so the number didn't look familiar. He said ""this is Keith. I know you know who I am. Remember me, the first guy to fuck you? Well now you're fucking me by talking shit about me to my girlfriend.""

Reddit - my jaw dropped. I mean, how does someone even respond to that? I responded that I was on a conference call and would get back to him later. Which I did.  Luckily I have learned how to pause and gather my thoughts and respond rather than react.  After work I texted back with this: ""hey Keith, I'm sorry that you're upset. I did speak with your girlfriend at work today.  She wanted to know more about our split. I explained that we had a crazy weekend of miscommunications and that we both moved on after.  I wished her well and I wish you well with her. There was no malice in my words. Best of luck to you guys in the future."" 

Know what I did next?  

I went for a run.

I didn't obsess about his response or her response or any of that. I just went for a run.  Oh my God, I'm an adult!

He did text back with ""that's not the story I heard but I wish you the best too.""  

I didn't respond because I felt no need.  

Anyway, at work the next day, the new girlfriend came over to my department for something.  She stopped at my desk and said ""I read your texts to Keith.  I don't know who you think you are but do not text my boyfriend again."" I told her that she had nothing to worry about and again, wished them the best.  I then looked her square in the eyes and said ""I want you to know that this is an entirely inappropriate conversation for the office,  I have been nothing but cordial to you.  If you confront me regarding your relationship again I will escalate this to HR. Now if you'll excuse me, I do need to get back to work.""  It was my proudest moment.  I wasn't shaking.  I was calm, matter of fact and direct.  She walked away and hasn't bothered me since. It's been a month so I suspect either she realizes that I'm not a threat or they've broken up.  Either way, I don't care. 

So there you have it. A young woman navigating the world with care and consideration for others. Not too shabby for a six month update!

Last night I decided to get together for coffee with him, mostly because my mother urged me to. I never told her the extent of what *exactly* happened, but she knows it's video game-related because we've gone over this problem before in the past. Anyway, I initiated the conversation via text and he agreed to meet me. 

I guess I don't know what I was expecting. Closure, maybe? Because I was pretty sure I wanted to end it and stop trying to work things out because I've BEEN working things out for the past five years. It's just become tiring. Anyway, he got into defence mode right away, basically listing all the things *I've* done wrong in the relationship and why *he's* over *me*. These are the things I've done wrong: 

1. I declined going to Korea last year for vacation. He so badly wanted to go. I knew if I went, I'd be left alone every day because his buddy would have come too. Also, there was a big LoL tournament happening at the time so he would've been doing LoL related things and mentally masturbating to the cosplayers all the time while I explored the city alone or hung out in a hotel. I said I wasn't interested in going, he got huffy but eventually got over it (or so I thought.) 

2. I changed my appearance even though I knew he liked women with long brown hair. I decided to cut my hair fairly short and bleach it blond not too long ago. It was time for a change anyway, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. He was not. 

3. I always refused to wear revealing clothing. He'd constantly badger me about how I don't wear enough stuff that shows off my tits and legs. I'm fairly modest, I'm not into that kinda stuff. I'm more comfortable in a t-shirt and jeans. He'd want me to wear sundresses and plunging tank tops, I always said no. 

4.  My birthday gift this year was a pair of those giant wrap-around headphones. Head gear. I don't know what they're called. All the Twitch streamers are wearing them. But he spent a fairly good amount of money on them. Which sounds sweet I guess, but I had originally complained that my old headphones suck, and I need new ones for the gym. He got me these bulky ones and got upset that I don't wear them much. *He's asked me in the past to wear them, put my hair in pigtails and wear revealing clothing around the house while wearing my glasses, I'm not even kidding. This guy is a major stereotype.* 

5. I didn't play LoL and I didn't enjoy sitting on the couch watching him play hours of LoL. I don't how to play the game, I tried numerous times, I suck. I didn't enjoy myself. Why would I keep at it? 

6. And... I was not open-minded about anything. This is pertaining to the situation in the OP. I'm not open minded enough about being his Fleshlight, so this hurt his feelings too. I'm not accepting of his kinks! Which is a total fucking lie because I've agreed to do some pretty ""out there"" stuff in the past to appease him. I'm very open-minded about sex. I would have appreciated a forewarning about the Twitch girl joining us in bed though. 

7. I don't get along with his friends. I tried to, SO HARD. I tried to relate to those guys like you wouldn't believe. But they all literally have zero social skills, they're awkward and blatantly ignored my existence whenever I was around. They'd start talking about things *they're* interested in and just disregard anything I ever said. They'd invite him to board game nights, asking if *I'd be going too* like they don't want me there. I was pretty much an outcast. So no, I tried. They just didn't want to be around me. 

So, in conclusion... I told him I was done. He didn't really react dramatically. I think he's done with the relationship too. He can watch all the Twitch he wants now and play LoL for 23 hours of the day! That must be quite a relief.

I'm going to the apartment to pick up whatever I can later. I'm staying with my parents until I find a new place. 

I feel oddly calm and okay with everything that's gone down in these last couple days. This is almost a relief. 

Thanks everyone.

&nbsp;

So this is an update to the post I made on Monday about the baby shower my mother in law threw me after I made it very clear to her that I did not want one and that it would make me uncomfortable. A few things to address left over from the last post:

&nbsp;

?	Brandon?s mom has never cared for me. Some people seemed to be under the impression that we were close because we?ve gone places together. She only began to take a real interest in me when I got pregnant; we are not and have never been close. She?s always blamed me for her son not having gone to church in the five years I?ve been with him, even though he?s been an atheist since he was 12. She also thinks I convinced him not to get a master?s degree? I literally had no part in that decision, when I met him he was already well finished with undergrad and had no intention of continuing.

&nbsp;

?	There really was no miscommunication. His mother broached the subject by telling me her plans for my baby shower. Not asking me if I wanted one, TELLING me she was going to throw me one. I said thank you but that I didn?t feel I needed one and that we could do something different. She persisted, and I said I really did not want one because it would make me uncomfortable. She then said ?okay? and I thought the subject was dropped. I thought about suggesting a family dinner where we could all share stories about childhood/parenting and have cake and whatnot, it sounded like a happy medium to me, but then she sprang the ?shower? on me. 

&nbsp;

?	For everyone telling me that I should have stayed and toughed it out, I will reiterate that when they called me to the shower under false pretenses, I was wearing an old T-shirt with paint stains, leggings that are getting too small for me so they were a little see through and not something I?d generally wear out of the house, flip flops, greasy hair in a bun, and it was 80 degrees out so I was hot and sweaty. I did not think I had to get out of the car because I thought I was just picking them up. This is absolutely relevant. If I had been dressed appropriately I would probably have stayed for a while before being like ?oh my aching (insert body part here), hahaha pregnancy, gotta go, thanks?. Some of you believe I shouldn?t have cared what I was wearing. I have a feeling those people were men because I don?t know a single woman that would tell me she?d show up to any party smelling like crap and looking even worse.

&nbsp;

?	Some people also seemed to be under the impression that she did this to be nice. I thought so at first, too. But the fact is, she did it after I explicitly told her no, she tricked me into coming, she didn?t invite a single person close to me, just people she knew, and when I justifiably did not stay, she called me a bitch and said I would be a bad mother. Many of you made me realize that this was done for HER, not for me. And for those of you who said I should have stayed to make her happy? couldn?t you say the same about her? That she should have just not thrown a party she knew I wouldn?t appreciate and that I?d feel uncomfortable at? I get the feeling if there?d been a post saying ?my daughter in law is so unreasonable for not letting me throw her a baby shower?, it?d be downvoted and she?d be taken to task for her presumptuousness and disrespect for my wishes.

&nbsp;

?	A few people also said I sounded like I wasn?t letting her be excited about the baby. I probably worded some things wrong. I was not upset that she told people at church or that she made it her Facebook status (although the intrusive messages I got from some of her friends did bother me, but I never said anything to her about it). There is a huge difference between being excited and her using my pregnancy as a means of getting attention. It makes me feel objectified and I don?t like it. 

&nbsp;

On to the update. Not long after I made my Reddit post, Erica called me. She was back in Houston and wanted to let me know that she was sorry about what happened and that she thought the shower was legit; she was surprised when she didn?t see anyone that could have been my friends or my sister, and even more surprised when I came in dressed like I was. Erica then told me that her mother had been complaining all day about how I won?t take her advice on anything pregnancy-related (i.e. do what she says without question), how I won?t tell her the sex (I don?t know it), and how I?m not excited about being pregnant (because I don?t like it when she tries to parade me around so she can get attention, and because I don?t want her posting baby pictures on Facebook when the baby?s born). Erica surmised that this party was meant to put me in my place, as did a few of the people MIL invited. 

&nbsp;

We took advice from many of you. Yesterday, Brandon went to his mom?s house on his lunch break. He told her in so many words that she was allowed to be excited but she was not allowed to try to run the show. He repeated that she cannot post baby pictures to Facebook or else she won?t be getting any. If family and friends want copies, I?ll send them straight away, but they?re not going online as long as we can help it. He told her that the shenanigans with pointing out my belly to random people are to stop, as are the inquiries about the baby?s gender, her criticisms, and her gifts with strings attached. He said we wouldn?t pay her back for the party I didn?t want, and for her to even ask was manipulative. And lastly he said that she was to apologize to me for humiliating me and for ignoring what I wanted in favor of what she wanted, and for calling me names and saying I?ll be a bad mom. He said those were the terms and she could take them or leave them, if she chose not to take them then she would not have a relationship with our baby or with us, so at this point it was up to her. I told him to make sure she knew I wasn?t against her seeing the baby, I just wanted her to stop stirring the pot and accept that this is my pregnancy and my child, not hers. 

&nbsp;

She vehemently denied she that she asked us for money or called me a bitch (we have the fucking voicemails) and that I ever told her I didn?t want a baby shower (bullshit). Then she said that she would think about it but that she still felt I owed her an apology for storming out and not staying. Brandon asked her how she expected me to do that dressed the way I was, and her response was ?it?s not my fault she?s such a slob?. That was it for Brandon, he got up to leave and said ?if you plan on treating my wife with respect, call me and let me know, otherwise you can forget about ever seeing the baby?. 

&nbsp;

MIL called him a few hours later while he was at work to say she was sorry and that she wanted to see the baby, Brandon replied that she needed to say it to me, not him, and that I?d be waiting for her call. That was 8 hours ago. Has she called me? Nope. I?ll give it some time. If/when she does call, I won?t gloat. I?ll be gracious and accept her apology, assuming it?s a sincere one and not the kind that goes like ?sorry you took it that way but?? So now we?re just playing the waiting game. 

&nbsp;

I got a lot of support from many of you who suggested I visit raisedbynarcissists, I subscribed on my regular account and it?s been really eye-opening. I?ve read some of the stories aloud to my husband who keeps saying ?yep, sounds just like my mom?. We decided that we?re going to plan a little babymoon for next month, and that?ll give us something to look forward to (other than the baby being born, obviously!). I?m just trying not to let his mom take up too much space in my head. I really hope she comes around, because like I said, I want our baby to have a grandmother. But the ball?s in her court, so we?ll see how it goes. Thanks again to everyone who was supportive, I really appreciate it and so does Brandon!

&nbsp;

tl;dr my husband talked to his mom, she denied she asked us for money or called me a bitch, says she still wants to see the baby but my husband has told her she has to apologize to me first, that was 8 hours ago and still nothing so now we're just waiting on her I guess",1433995371.0,"UPDATE: Me [25F] and husband [29M] of 2 years having a baby, his mom [53F] embarrassed me by throwing me an unwanted party",0.87

Hey guys.

My original post garnered more attention that I've ever personally received here so I figured I'd do an update.

Shortly after my post, John (the boyfriend) and I broke up.
Big surprise right?

It was mostly mutual, still really sucked.
He pushed to try and ""make things work"" -- What does that even mean?

And would constantly flip flop from ""I'm never moving back"" to ""Well, I'll move back for YOU"".

No thanks.

A) I wasn't a reason to stay here in the first place, so why would I be the reason he would move back? and B) seems like a quick path to resentment if I'm the sole reason he would be moving back.

So yeah, we broke up.
I unceremoniously sent back what few belongings of his I had to his new address.
We went NC shortly after.

Details emerged several weeks following from various sources (I.E. mutual friends, randoms) that while we were dating there were ""always girls at his apartment"".

Okay...cool.
Didn't know what to believe.

A week ago I was cleaning out my car and found makeup under the passenger seat that didn't belong to myself or any of my female friends.
I also should add that John frequently borrowed my car on occasion during our relationship.

So idk, he was probably also cheating/at the very least being shady.

Somehow this person I'm not even with anymore continues to be able hurt me.


Luckily other areas of my life are coming together nicely.
I recently got a new job that I love.

I'm also working at two different places and 7 days a week so I don't have time to be a total mess haha.
I have more money than I've ever had in my entire life and no longer have to sweat bullets when it comes time to pay my bills.

Currently still in the post breakup phase of crying in my car on the way home from work sometimes if I'm particularly exhausted.

I've done all the stereotypically ""moving on stuff"" like cutting my hair, going on a few dates, getting drunk, shopping, masturbating, etc.

But I still miss him and he still occupies a good portion of my thoughts.
Just kind of waiting for it to pass I guess....

So yeah, thanks again to everyone who offered words of advice, wisdom, or kindness when I came here 2 months ago totally wrecked emotionally, I really appreciated it.

Hopefully whatever comes next is totally fucking awesome and I won't have anything to post about anymore ??



**TL;DR: John and I broke up. Details of him possibly cheating during our relationship emerged shortly after. Still really bummed but life is looking up. Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond.**

798,relationship_throw_,Relationships,4vk0ln,1759,"My [31M] girlfriend [31F] and I will be celebrating the one year anniversary of the day we met and had our first date on Monday. I am divorced. I was with my ex-wife [31F] for 10 years (dated for 2 and married for 8) and my divorce was finalized 2 years ago, a year before I met my girlfriend. I filed for divorce because my ex-wife had cheated with someone she worked with [30s?M] 

My girlfriend [31F] is also divorced. She was also with her ex-husband [32M] for 10 years (dated for 3 and married for 7) and her divorce was also finalized a year before we met. My girlfriend filed for divorce because her ex-husband cheated with my wife?s younger sister [27F] and her sister got pregnant. When it came out that this happened, my girlfriend?s parents [50s?M&F] and the rest of her family supported her sister and told my girlfriend she was overreacting (I?ve seen copies of the court transcript from her divorce so I know my girlfriend is not lying). They threw her sister a baby shower and were upset that my girlfriend didn?t attend and they chipped in to pay for her husband?s divorce lawyer. Her sister also moved in with her ex-husband after my girlfriend moved out of the house and had to buy her out of her half as part of the divorce settlement. Her mom told her they had edited her out of all the family pictures and ripped up the rest. My girlfriend cut contact and hasn?t seen, spoken or had contact with any person from either side of her family since she got divorced a year ago.

My girlfriend has moved on. She moved across the state, has a house, a new job and new friends and she was adopted by her mentor from in the military reserves so she could be legally severed from her parents. I have a great relationship with my family and they all supported me through my divorce. I can?t imagine how it must have felt to not have family support during that time. They didn?t even want her to divorce him and said the sister could just live in their basement and my girlfriend had to live in a hotel for a year when she filed and moved out because no one would take her in. Over the year we have been together my girlfriend has told me the story but I haven?t pushed her because it?s so painful obviously. She has her mentor, her friends from the military and her new friends but I get that it?s not completely the same. My parents [61M/56F] have met my girlfriend once now and soon my brothers [33/32M] and the rest of my family will be meeting her. With my girlfriend?s permission I have shared the gist of her story (not the details) with my parents and brothers. My parents loved her and I know my family wants her to feel as loved and welcome as possible. I want the same thing for her and I want to support her as much as I can. I love her but I?m a bit emotionally and feeling challenged and I?m not always the best with showing emotions and talking about stuff. It probably seems obvious to other people but I am unsure.

My questions are 1) What are some ways I can be supportive of my girlfriend as she keeps building her new life without her family and gets over the divorce? 2) What are things for me not to do? 3) My mom and dad and family want to make her feel welcome in the family but I have no clue how they can without doing it wrong.

So, I wanted to thank everyone for all of their help. I was really worried it would be awkward dropping trou for my husband's brother. It was awkward, but only for a second, and as you can now figure out, yes he's now my doctor. 

My BIL knew what Mike was going to ask him. Mike was not stealthy and asked that they talk alone. But, my BIL knew that when I got pregnant there was a chance he would be required to conduct my delivery as he works shifts like most surgeons and there was a chance I would be at that hospital and need his services as he performs many of the high-risk deliveries. 

Anyway, he went to the legal department and they confirmed that he could legally be my physician and because of the law, and the generalities of my case, he would be exempt from the treating family conditions. So, when Mike showed-up, BIL knew what he was going to ask. BIL, Mike and myself got together and discussed the situation and we talked about what would happen if things didn't ""work out"" with my pregnancy. 

I talked to Mike that night and we went back-and-forth. I think we know going in that this is risky, that I have a greater than average chance of losing the baby; but, if we don't go with BIL, he recommended another specialist more than two hours away. We still felt we'd be more comfortable with BIL and we called him, probably too late at night, and told him we'd really rather go with him. 

He booked me in for an appointment. Mike and I went and we went through all of the information. It came time and he did the exam (downstairs) and I was really impressed. He was quick, thorough but professional and incredibly gentle. I am used to my gyno doing demolition down there and was so surprised I didn't walk-out in any pain. I was embarrassed for a second, but he kept my mind on other things and by the time I realized I was still naked, it was all over. The weirdness was all on my end and it was actually not nearly as odd as I thought and I was really happy we were moving forward. 

BIL answered a million questions, always with a smile and made us feel... empowered. He let us make decisions and we talked about how we wanted the pregnancy to work. All-in-all, we both left the appointment feeling a lot better and more prepared.

800,marriagenextweek,Infidelity,41uvu2,1757,"Our marriage is an arranged one, it's been arranged for 6 years and initially both my fiance and I were very hesitant about it but getting to know each other and spending time together we both ended up falling for each other. We didn't even set a date until late 2014 when we both realized I'd like to marry this person, not because our parents set us up but because we actually were in love and wanted to be together.


We both had our bachelor/bachelorette parties this weekend and it wasn't anything really, my girlfriends and I went to dinner, had some wine and that was it. My brother informed me Sunday night that my fiance had sex with a girl they picked up at a bar they were drinking at. Apparently his (fiance, not my brother) best friend, who is married himself, invited the girl there as my fiance's best friend worked with the girl and knew my fiance thought she was cute the few times they met.


It wasn't a big bachelor party, only 8 guys or so and apparently the girl who came to meet them at the bar. By the time my fiance left with the girl, it was only his best friend, my brother and one other single friend of ours who was with a girl he met that night. But before they left they hooked up in the bathroom of the bar.


I guess my fiance and his best friend didn't expect my brother to say anything because they're all good friends.


I don't know what to do, a lot of money has gone into this wedding, our families are both the types to frown heavily on marriages (and engagements) falling apart and would likely tell me to just bury it, put it in the past and start anew on our wedding day.


I've spent the past 2 days feeling sick to my stomach, I haven't seen my fiance the past couple days either but tomorrow I'll see him (this is normal btw as we both have heavy work schedules and from Friday we are both going on leave for a couple weeks)



I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to be doing at this point.

tl;dr fiance cheated with a girl at his bachelor party, brother told me what happened


Edit/update:

Sorry for not posting responses to anyone last night, I came home from word and had a lot to do.

To answer 2 of the more frequent questions:

Yes, I am indian.

No, my brother is not lying or making things up to sabotage anything, we've always been very close and I trust him.

I also know he isn't lying because I talked to my former fiance last night and asked him what happened, he broke down and started apologizing saying it was the stupidest thing he'd ever done. 

He said that he did love me, really and truly did, but over the past year and more we've been engaged he's felt like we started all of this built on something false (being arranged by our parents) and that his feet have been growing colder with every day that comes closer to the wedding.

He said that he's been feeling as if he didn't have a chance to really find the woman he loved and instead we were just sort of introduced to each other and we fell for each other along the way. He said he feels as though it was not natural and that over the past year due to cold feet, he's been falling out of love with me. He still 'loves' me he says but he's not in love with me

I asked him why he cheated, why he couldn't just tell me this is what he wanted. I would have felt like shit but I would have understood and he admitted that it wasn't until he actually hooked up with that girl that he got the balls to tell me, he was planning on doing so this past weekend. He assured me she meant nothing to him but he had no way of being strong enough to break things off without reason. He said that it gave him the push he would need to do that. He also knows my brother told me but doesn't hold it against him, I guess it's a relief.

The long story short, we are no longer engaged, I'm heartbroken, cheated on and the guy I loved told me he no longer loves me. Both our families have some money and he's offered to reimburse my parents who were paying around 2/3 of the cost of the actual wedding.

He'll also be the one who informs both sets of parents this weekend about what will no longer be happening.",1453304698.0,"Brother informed me [30F] that my fiance [32M] cheated at his bachelor party this past weekend, our wedding is on the 30th",0.96

First off, I'd like to get a few things off of my chest about the messages I received about my situation. Thank you SO much to those who supported me and were kind and sympathetic to all this. I got many very kind messages of encouragement and stranger love! That being said, I got a plethora of PMs from people telling me that I deserved everything that happened to me because I refused to adopt; that I deserve a life of loneliness and that I should kill myself. That really sucked and made me want to actually die. 

I don't think I'm a bad person for not wanting to adopt. I don't think it's bad to prefer biological children over an adopted child. 95% of the world feels the same obviously because the vast majority people do not adopt. I think it takes a brave and very loving person to be able to take on a child that isn't theirs - I am not one of those people, and I'm sorry if that offends you. Now onto the update...

___

The day after my post, I spoke to a lawyer and he agreed to take me on as a client. On Thursday my lawyer and I met up to discuss what I expected out of the divorce. I also spoke to a therapist on Friday. She told me that the best course of action at this point was to take some time to myself and to not contact my husband. 

Over the past few days, I had been thinking about his leaving and the entirety of our situation and decided that even though I was furious as to how he handled it, I can understand his want to leave. If I cannot provide a child for him and that is truly what he wants, then he needed to leave. I was in a calmer state of mind by Friday, although everything was still numb. I couldn't stop replaying in my mind him sliding the papers towards me and then telling me that he loved me but couldn't be with me. It still isn't real. 

On Saturday afternoon, everything came crashing down again. I was trying to block everything out of my mind by binge watching Netflix when the doorbell rang. My heart tightened as I walked towards the door and opened it to my husband. He looked terrible, almost worse than I did. Without looking me in the eye, he asked if he could come in and I couldn't even speak. I moved my body to the side of the doorway and motioned him inside. In this moment, it took me everything I had not to kiss him and to punch him all at the same time. We sat down on the couch together in silence for what seemed like 10 minutes. He finally spoke and all he said was, ""infertileoldmaid, I'm so sorry."" I was silent. We sat for about 2 more minutes before I finally had the courage to ask, ""Is that all you wanted to say?"" He shook his head and began to tear up, which of course caused me to tear up. He again buried his head in his hands and sighed. He told me that he'd been feeling like he was missing out on fatherhood. I told him through tears that I understood and didn't blame him for wanting children, but he cut me off. He told me that wasn't it. He told me that he'd been seeing a young woman at his work for the past 6 months and that he couldn't keep lying to me any longer. They were having both an emotional and physical relationship and she had been pressuring him to leave me for a few months. He claimed his insecurities about his lack of a family was pushing him to feel that he needed change and that she was a huge mistake. 

At this point, I couldn't take it anymore. I told him to get the fuck out of my house. He looked at me like a scared puppy and panicked told me that he wanted another chance and that he'd just broken off things with his coworker and was willing to forgo kids to be with me. I didn't know what to do so I just started to scream, yelling at him to get out and that I was completely done. He just began to sob and started pleading for me to calm down. It was clear that he wasn't going to leave, so I did. I grabbed my keys and ran out of the house. I drove for 30 minutes out of town, parked on the side of an empty road and cried for an hour. Driving back into town, I looked at my phone and saw that my husband had called over 20 times and texted me things like how he was so sorry and that she was nothing... blah blah blah. I didn't delete any of these messages because I knew how important they were for my lawyer to see. When I arrived back to my house, he was no longer there. I walked inside and all was the same, he took nothing and broke nothing, which was relieving. 

I regained my composure and sense of reality and called my lawyer and left him a very long message about what had just happened. Today my lawyer got back to me and told me to come in first thing on Tuesday morning.

Husband has not tried to contact me since one last text on Sunday that read, ""I love you, infertileoldmaid. I fucked up and I'm sorry for hurting you. If you ever need me, I'll be here for you."" My mind is again in turmoil and I feel like I am dying. I have yet to tell any of my friends and family what has happened and I'm not sure that I will be able to.

tl;dr - he was cheating on me. Any talking regarding my husband will now be exclusively with my lawyer and therapist.

EDIT: I removed all information regarding anything my lawyer and I discussed.

802,helpmereddittrip,Updates,46zehe,1751,"Hi reddit. I?m back again with an update. Unfortunately my previous post was locked but I think you can still read it. The link is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44l020/my_clique_of_friends_2324f_planned_a_grad_trip/

I have gotten a few PMs asking for an update. I even got one less than 24 hours after I posted the original. I decided if things went well, I wasn?t going to update. As you can already guess, things did not go well.

Firstly, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who replied. I didn?t manage to reply to everyone but I did read everyone?s comments. The day after I posted on reddit, I discussed with the rest of the group to ensure everyone was one the same page and it was decided that I would speak to Alexa on behalf of everyone.  

This was what I texted her: ?Alexa, we got your message about the baby shower. We would still like to go for the graduation trip after so much planning and saving for it. Going next year or even in the next few years is not feasible for us due to work. Unfortunately, we will not be able to attend your planned baby shower as a result. We would still like to celebrate your baby shower after we return from the trip and throw another separate baby shower. How does that sound to you? :) ? I sent her this privately. She replied ?Ok?. So that?s it right? Crisis averted. All is well.

We then created another group chat to discuss her baby shower. Things like venue, food, presents and other logistics. Here is where things start to go wrong. Two days after we created the group chat for her baby shower, Alexa removed herself from the group chat. Aly was the one who noticed it and pointed it out to everyone. At this point, we are all becomingly increasingly annoyed with this kind of passive-aggressive behaviour from Alexa. I texted Alexa privately again and just cut straight to the chase.

This was our conversation:

Me: Alexa, why did you leave the group chat for the baby shower? Are you not keen on doing a separate baby shower?

Alexa: Why are you still going for the trip? >: ( We planned it TOGETHER. It is very unfair to go without me.

Me: This trip was planned months in advance and everyone else still wants to go?

Alexa: It's not fair to me to leave me behind. If everyone doesn?t go its fair to everyone.

Me: What about Aly and Kayla who have been saving for this trip? Are you going to give back the time they spent saving for this trip?

Alexa: Ppl who cannot afford a month?s rent or food dont deserve vacations.

Me: Listen. Everything has been planned for the trip. Even though you will be missed during the trip, we are still looking forward to it. Let us know if you would like the separate baby shower.  

Alexa: Fuck you. fucking anorexic bitch. 

I did not reply anything after that exchange. I'm a bit hurt honestly as I've always been on the thin side and have had multiple strangers come up to me to ask if I'm anorexic and it makes me feel self conscious. all my friends know this.

 If you recall from the original post, I mentioned that Aly and Kayla come from lower income families. Only my 3 of us from come wealthy families. The rest of us are from middle income families. Kayla?s family is extremely poor. She lives with her parents in a rented 2 room apartment that is very small. Last year her mother fell ill and had to stop working and they struggled to pay rent. I have helped her out twice to help her family cover rent. She has paid me back since then.  She never eats out and brings her own food from home. She and Aly are studying on a scholarship and have been working every weekend and some evenings while studying full time to save for this trip for the past year. If this semester goes well, Kayla has a very high chance of being the valedictorian.

I also did mention in a comment that one of the reasons I am not close to Alexa is that we have differing political opinions that are very hard to reconcile. This is only one of them. She has some very snobbish ideas about poor people, homeless people and people who require monetary assistance from the government. I have noticed this in her frequently though it has been very low key. 


I showed the rest of the group how the messages went and asked them not to show Kayla or Aly but obviously their SOs were upset and told them and eventually they found out anyway. Aly and Kayla were very upset and angry about what Alexa said. I wanted to minimise hurting people?s feelings but it seems like I have done the opposite. We have not spoken to Alexa since that day and she hasn?t texted us either. If she still wants us to plan another shower, we would do it. But honestly, I hope she doesn?t. 

As for Adrian, we have decided not to un-invite him. The reason being that he was already invited long before this situation occurred and it would be rude to un-invite him. I know there were many people saying he should not go and it would be irresponsible for him to go but I think that is something Adrian will decide for himself. At this point it seems like Adrian intends to only be involved in the child?s life financially. I do not necessarily agree with his choice, but again that is his choice to make. I asked him whether he still wanted to come for the trip and he said he definitely wants to. I told him if he wished to drop out due to the baby at any point, it would be perfectly fine. He said that probably won?t happen. 


So that?s the whole update. I?m still very excited for this trip despite all the drama that has happened. Thank you to everyone for their advice. 

 **tl;dr**: Told Alexa we are still going for the trip and would like to plan a separate baby shower for her after the trip. She seemed okay with it at first but later said it was unfair for us to go without her. Eventually led to her insulting me. Haven't spoken to her since then. We are still going ahead with the trip.

tl;dr: Girlfriend's family said racist shit during thanksgiving, how do I deal with them in the future?

So yeah, a lot of shit has gone down since my original post. First of all, I wanted to thank everyone for their responses. I was blown away by the attention my previous post got, and wanted to thank everyone for their time and input.

Moving on, yesterday I texted my girlfriend to come over to my apartment to talk. I was planning on telling her that I was really upset by the fact that she didn?t defend me at all from her racist relatives, and that she didn?t prepare me by properly informing me of how her family behaves. In addition, I was hoping we could make an agreement for the future on how to properly deal with these sorts of situations.

So she came over later on in the evening.  We sat down, and I first began by discussing what how pissed I was that she neither prepared me for the incident, nor defended me when it occurred. She immediately broke down and started crying. Then, she started saying how sorry she was for putting me in that situation and that she had her reasons. 

Apparently, she had kept me a secret from her family for the past two years because she knew they would not approve of her choices. A few months ago, one of her family friends that we go to college with saw us together on a date or something. She then went and told her family that my girlfriend was dating an Indian guy. So for the last few months, without my knowledge, my girlfriend has been constantly getting phone calls, texts, emails from her family, old friends, that she should break up with me, she could do a lot better, and that she wasn?t safe around someone like me. She basically ignored all of their requests, and repeatedly tried to explain to them that she was happy with me and they should try and respect her feelings. She showed me some texts and it displayed how they were emotionally blackmailing her, saying bullshit like they put food on her table and took care of her for all these years, and doesn?t she care for her family at all? After a few months of this, she told them that they should at least give me a chance and meet me, with the hope that they would somehow change their opinion and understand her feelings. She didn?t want to tell me the full scope of how fucked up her family was because she was scared I would break up with her. I was really saddened to hear this, because that would NEVER happen. Also, the reason she remained quiet during her family?s racist talks, was she thought arguing back would further exacerbate the situation, and we would have no chance of them changing their opinion.

After I had left their house the morning after Thanksgiving, her parents told her how rude and disrespectful they found me, and also how it wasn?t ?proper? for her to date outside of her race. Her Grandmother apparently thought I was part of Obama?s Muslim brotherhood, sent here to fight for the islamification of America (Lol I know, I had no idea idiots like this existed). They then gave her an ultimatum, either end our relationship, or they would cut her off completely. Her parents pay for both her college and residence expenses.  She was trying to find the right time and best way to tell me this, which I?m guessing is why she avoided this topic for the past week. She came to the decision that she wanted to continue dating me, and informed her family of that decision. 

For the next hour, we discussed whether or not this was the right decision for her.  I felt guilty that I would be the reason she goes into massive student debt, but she told me this was the right choice. She could no longer stand their toxic presence in her life, and the way they treated me was the last straw. So I guess this is where we?re at right now, we?re trying to figure out how to deal with all the fallout together.  

In all honesty, I?m very proud of her for the way she handled an extremely difficult situation. I wish that she had told me beforehand, so we could have dealt with this together, but she held strong to what her personal feelings and didn?t allow herself to be walked all over by her family. She?s been through a lot of shit in her life, and I?m really happy that she stood up to them.

tl;dr: Turns out her famly was trying to get her to break up with me, she tried to introduce me to hopefully change their opinion. It didn't work, they cut her off because she is continuing to date me, we're dealing with the fallout now.",1449174430.0,"[Update] My [22M] girlfriend?s [21F] family said some pretty racist shit about me during Thanksgiving, not sure what to do?",0.96

Hi guys! So you may remember my post from January (above) I received a lot of messages and wanted to give you all an update.
I have recently moved, changed my job to another branch, with a promotion! Anna is adjusting really well and is so happy that her mum is offically her mum. We completed the adoption and had a little party, just the two of us. 
I even got my first proper mothers day card (with the help of Angelas mother) from Anna.  I never thought I'd be so happy.
Anna still sees her bio mother's parents and they love her. I went no contact with my parents, I really have nothing more to say about them, it's a severed tie that will stay that way. I have started communicating with Angela via post to a po box so she doesn't know where I am. She has written letters for me to give Anna one day. I have read them all and saved them for Anna one day if she wants them. Angela sounds remorseful and has given me proof of being clean. I'm not yet ready to allow her any access to Anna and she would have to do a huge amount to be allowed near her. 
Lance hasn't showed any interest in his daughter.
Mainly Anna is happy, I'm her mother and that's all that matters. I've also started seeing someone special that Anna is excited to meet and she's already trying to plan a wedding!  
Thank you,  you wonderful reddit people you gave me the confidence I have now that will help me be the mother Anna deserves.

**Update**: Holy hell. I can't believe it's been 2 years. I just dug up this old throwaway and read my OP and all the comments. There was some really brutal truths in there that brought me to tears, and I really thank you guys for giving me the solid kick in the ass I needed to realize how foolish I was for staying with him.

I'm not sure if anyone remembers me, but a lot has changed and I wanted to give you guys that do remember an update on what happened.

Well, we ended up staying together another few weeks after I originally posted. There were a few ""last straws"" that sent me packing, including him stealing $3000 from me to play high stakes underground billiards with sketchy fucking friends of his one night, and him kicking me in the stomach and sending me flying across the room after I said I didn't want to have a baby with him.

I'm not going to lie, it wasn't easy to plan my escape, nor was it easy for me to pickup and leave my school and jobs. I said I was going home to visit my parents one night, and packed whatever I could into my little car and drove all the way home. He of course freaked out and called me and screamed and said he was going to find me and bring me back (kind of hard to do when you don't speak English and can't read). Somehow he DID find me a few weeks later when I was walking back to my car in the parking lot of my old job (I went to them and explained my situation and they welcomed me back with open arms). I screamed at him and told him he ruined my life and to never speak to me again, which prompted him to start RAMMING HIS HEAD repeatedly into the side of my car trying to ""kill himself"". That night still gives me nightmares.

After a few more incidents like this he finally laid off after my sweet wonderful father threatened him (I finally disclosed everything to my family, the money, the beating..). They welcomed me back home and helped me get back on my feet.

A few months later I met my wonderful now boyfriend, and we've been together ever since. He's so kind and supportive and we have a little house together now, and are looking to move to a bigger one so we can start a family. I haven't heard a thing from my ex, I 
really hope he got deported or something. Oh, and I didn't end up joining the army, but I do have 1 (not 3!) job now and have just finished signing up for a community college in my area.

I read this sub all the time, everyone's stories really break my heart. All the the people that are in toxic relationships, I feel your pain, I understand the fear of staying and the fear of going, I understand what the signs are, how you can brush the red flags under the rug, I get it now. As someone who really thought their life was never going to get better, and as someone who really didn't have the metaphorical balls to get up and walk away from a poisonous relationship for several years, it *does* get better, and you *can* walk away.

Again, thank you all for the advice you guys, it really helped me 2 years ago when I was in such a dark place, and today I can proudly say my life is better and I've found real love.

Maybe if had more patience for wandering in bed I would do it, but I can't. I just feel the need to do something else.

Also happens we have sex early. I can cuddle for 15 minutes but if she falls asleep again off I want to go. I just like the morning breeze and drinking coffee before 7, and feeling productive from early in the morning.

For the past few months, I've realized that whenever I've walked past the meat department in my local grocery store, one of the butchers has been batting his eyelashes at me and giving me that look. I wanted his meat. After I made my post, I realized I needed to do something about it. 

My mom and I went out to lunch today and I mentioned my crush to her in passing, mainly as a joke. She decided to hatch a plan. We went to the grocery store together and she led me over to the meat section and asked him about the salmon. She then promptly deserted me (because she realized right then and there that she needed ""coasters"").

I freaked out and started talking to the butcher about the sushi they sold (they also make/ sell sushi rolls at his station). I wanted a vegetarian roll without seaweed, so I asked him if they could make sushi with soy paper instead. He said yes, so he called the sushi chef over. The sushi chef took one look at me and sort of elbowed the butcher with a smile. Talk about butterflies. 

I got my sushi roll and said au revoir to the butcher. But I had a plan. While we were checking out, I asked the cashier if she he had a pen and a piece of paper. I wrote down my name and number. I was absolutely shaking in my boots.

While my mom left to go put stuff in the car, I ran back over to the butcher and slid him the folded paper. He was with a customer, so as he quickly read the paper I smiled at him and left the store. He smiled back.

Original post wasn?t popular at all, but I want to thank everyone that commented and I took all the advice, from telling my friends and family and writing down the reasons I am better without him.

When I made up my mind to break up for good, I was so relieved it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders that I didn?t even know was there. 

However, it took me to the end see what a monster the drugs (that he?s doing by his own choice) turn him into. I was going to his place to return his keys, and since the drugs make him paranoid, I had to make sure to hand the keys in person to avoid him accusing me of never returning them. He seemed normal and in a decent mood, he invited me in saying he just finished cooking. Stupid me, I was hungry, and agreed thinking we could end on a positive note. 

Bad idea.

He got agitated and was set off very fast at the fact that I was truly leaving him this time. He wouldn?t let me leave and got physical with me, telling me I ruined his life and was responsible for his actions (remember he?s got some drug induced psychosis or something). I finally ran out and got home safely after a couple hours trying to defend myself without setting him off more. 

I?ve blocked his texts and all social media. I initially had some nightmares that either he killed himself or of him murdering me but as of the last couple days I just no longer feel guilty about leaving and have accepted that he?s responsible fo himself - he?s had many chances to accept free help. 

Only problem is, I?m still able to receive his (many) voicemails so that sucks. 
I?m a little nervous that he?ll show up at my house but I?m staying alert. Other than that, life is good! I?m just angry at myself for taking this long to leave him. But at least I?ve learned from it.

But when we met, I had been taking adderall for the previous three years. I was prescribed the medication when I decided to go to college, and I believe it assisted me in getting very good grades. But when I met my gf, she told me to stop taking the medication, that it was destroying my brain, and that she would not stay with me if I continued to take it.

So, first off, I want to thank everyone who (productively) commented on my post. You guys really helped me out, and I appreciated it. To the people who decided it would be funny to flame my girlfriend's account, calling her a ""fucking dyke"" and shaming her for being a woman with short hair, fuck yourselves.  
  
Anyway, so your posts gave me a lot to think about-- mostly the fact that I realized I was focused so much on being embarrassed by her choice that I forgot that I have been in love with this amazing, beautiful, bold and talented woman for two years.
  
On the car ride from the airport (about two hours), we wound up having a really, really great talk. I told her that I had posted about our situation on reddit and she wanted to know what people had said, so she pulled up the comments on her phone and read through it. She read a lot of the comments about how she had done it on purpose to act out/be rebellious/test me, and she started laughing. When I asked her why she was laughing, she told me that she hadn't gotten a hair cut to be rebellious or challenge me, she'd gotten it done because she wanted to look nice and put together-- her hair had been growing out lately, and as it's really naturally curly, she wanted to make sure she didn't look unkempt when meeting my parents. She did admit that maybe she could have gone longer, but knowing that she is the type of woman who has so much confidence in herself made me proud that she stayed true to herself when (admittedly), I had been kind of a dick. 
   
So, we got to my parents house, and my parents were SO EXCITED to see us and meet her that I honestly don't even think they noticed her hair until much later. During the day,  my girlfriend pitched in during dinner and helped with cleanup and was nothing but charming and kind and wonderful. As we were sitting around enjoying our dessert, my mom commented on my girlfriend's hair, asking her to tell her about the choice of how she came to the decision to cut her hair so short. My girlfriend got sort of nervous, thinking she was going to be criticized, but my mom actually told my girlfriend that she has been thinking of getting her hair cut short and wanted to know how much easier it is to take care of! 
   
So, the moral of the story is that I learned that I need to trust my girlfriend. I learned that she had nothing but good intentions, and I learned that my parents can be more open-minded than I thought. My mom actually pulled my aside and told me how much they appreciated my GF's willingness to participate and help out and they were very impressed with her overall. 
  
TL;DR: Haircuts are not always acts of rebellion or tests, sometimes a haircut is just a haircut. Everything worked out better than I could have ever imagined. Merry Christmas, everyone.

813,throwaway_191111,Relationships,6nbwd0,1734,"Hi everyone!

So, I'll dive right in. My gf took me to a ""meeting"" that she said was important to her the other night. Turned out to be an MLM presentation for World Wide Dream Builders which is basically an AMO (amway motivational organization).

Basically, it's amway but they tell you that you have to earn a mentorship from them (by buying things and going to paid events) and then they will teach you to be a debt free cash flow something or other.

I was floored and shocked at what I was at and as you can probably guess, I have a less than stellar opinion of these things. This was the first I was hearing of this. She had gone to some conference a few months back and wouldn't tell me what it was because ""I would probably just google it"" and ""that's not the way I should learn about it"". 

The people speaking to the 1500+ people at this event the other night are the ones that she is trying to ""earn"" a mentorship from. She feels as though they are her best friends and some of the greatest people she's ever met and I should feel privileged to have gotten the chance to hear them speak. 

I felt dirty, not privileged when I left the event. She told me that ""these are the two best people that YOU will ever get the chance to meet in your life and you should feel privileged to even have the chance to hear them speak."" I don't want to use the term brain-washed, but I want to. 

We talked about it last night and it did not go well. I told her that if she wanted to do this, I would support her but I did not want to be an active part of it. This does not seem to be okay with her and she is ""disappointed in me."" and she will be dedicating a majority of her time to ""building this asset"" going forward. 

I would really like to make this work but I'm not really sure if that is possible.  Any suggestions or similar experiences? We are supposed to talk again tonight when she gets off work.

We've been messaging each other for months now, and the whole thing is planned and ready.

She makes great money, and she's starting to worry that he's counting on her to support them both. He sits at home all day and watches TV, and she's had to pay most of his bills for a while now. He's apparently hinted that he would love to just move to Canada and live with her until he can apply for a visa. It's getting to the point where she's considered breaking up with him. I know that she loves him and wants to stay with him - but she's worried that he has no drive to get his life back in order. Jen is a very high-achiever with a ton of goals and ambition, and she's worried that he doesn't have the same drive.

I've messaged him a few times since the problems appeared and suggested that he maybe wait to propose. I told him that there's no rush, and I'm happy to help him organize something whenever they're ready. I've done this a few times, and he's insistent that he wants to do it on New Year's Eve. Jen is incredibly practical, and my instinct says that she would never say yes to a proposal unless she was absolutely sure it would work. He's planned an elaborate public display that I think could be seriously embarrassing for my friend.

Well, my parents got over how unhappy they were. My dad has since shut his mouth when it comes to the wedding. Now my mom is trying to 100% control everything.

She wants to invite 100+ people and have it at her venue. My Fiance and I found a lovely venue that can seat up to 100 people but we want at most 70 which we tried compromising on as well as the venue had a minimum so we were willing to go higher to meet it for this venue.


She completely lost her mind at this. She wants it at the country club of which my grandfather was a member of my Uncles are members and my cousins are members. She refuses to hear otherwise. HEr definition of compromise is that we are wanting to have it on a Monday because it falls on a certain date aka my Fiances grandparents and parents were members, a small way to honour his late mother who he was extremely close to.

So that is what she believed SHE compromised on. So she literally wants to set up EVERYTHING else. 

I'm done. And I told her so. I was so upset that she couldn't even try to not make it about herself I went No Contact with her. I told her we will pay her back for the dress. It's beautiful btw.

Jokes on her though, We will have a wonderful ceremony with my fiances entire family and she will not be there. She will have nothing to do with my wedding and it will be wonderful. My brother is extremely angry with me as he is her GoldenChild and now is basically her flying monkey as well. My dad hasn't said a word to me but he never really talks to me anyway.

TLDR: Mom got over her anger and tried to control absolutely everything about the wedding. Got angry went No contact with her and she is no longer invited. Will have my wedding with just my fiances family and be very happy. They are lovely people.

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their comments. I will absolutely post this to r/JUSTNOMIL and I'm a huge lurker there which is how I know the lingo as some of you pointed out.

There are a few of you who are concerned with the future of my relationship with my mother. Of course, should she apologize and learn from this I would be more than happy to reconcile with her. However, after 24 years I have grown to know my mother and know that she will probably drop dead before that happens. If she doesn't apologize by the wedding date I think a good 6 months after, I may try very low contact again and reach out. If she doesn't apologize by the wedding comes around she will not be invited that is my hard boundary.

Re the moving out situation: I didn?t bring on a subletter, and let her live alone for a month. My plan had been to move to the city and live happily ever after. I was planning on moving into a shared house via a startup called Campus. Literally the day before I was supposed to move, they shuttered their operations. SO, I moved in with my parents because I did NOT want to go back to living with Holly. This worked out well for me financially. After a couple of months I found a new place in the city and moved in there - all was great. Holly renewed her lease with an acquaintance from college who was moving to our area. 

I mentioned that Holly had issues with professionalism - well, Holly ended up getting fired from her job. I reached out to another agency in her industry I knew well, in the same field, to set her up with an interview (ugh, why) and she ended up getting the role. After she got it, I went for coffee with her to talk about it, which was the first time I?d seen her since the move. 

She told me she wasn?t enjoying living with ?Emma? because Emma would never invite her to things or be home as much as she originally said she would (shocker). In general, it sounded like Emma dealt with a lot of what I?d dealt with.

Then I brought up something funny, that I?d matched on Tinder with a guy who?d worked with Holly at the agency she?d been let go from. I had met him once at some company thing I?d gone to with her. She immediately asked me to message him and ask him what he thought of her. She told me she?d had the biggest crush on him the whoooole time she?d worked there and that he was The One for her. We left it at that, with her asking me to promise to message him. I said maybe.

Well, I did message him. And we went on a date. She texted me almost every day asking if I?d heard from him and when I finally responded and said we were going out, she became extremely upset. She asked me to make a choice between him or her. She said I was boyfriend stealing, and that I wasn?t a good friend. I wanted to tell her I WASN?T HER FRIEND. So I took her up on her ultimatum, and I chose him over her.

2.5 years later that guy and I live together and have the most gorgeous dog and life. We have a great friend group, great jobs, and our families are so close we?ve all spent Christmas and Thanksgiving together too. He?s so hot and cool. I'm 25 now and he's 29. Our dog is a 1 and a half Aussie!

I?ve never spoken to Holly again, but since my boyfriend is close to his old coworkers (don?t worry, he wasn?t fired) who keep up with Holly on social media, I?ve heard that she moved to L.A. and has cycled through FOUR more companies, each time getting fired. I don?t know much else about her life since she blocked me on every single form of social media INCLUDING VENMO. I?ve never met a person who knew her that didn?t think she was batshit, so that?s validation.

She was still in high school and I was working a few crappy jobs and not done with my tech degree. We'd had a whole life planned out and this hadn't been in it? You know?

But within a few days of her telling me, I had calmed down and I knew we could do this. The first year would be tough, but then I would graduate and have a good job and we could make it work. We planned our new life out together- when she'd go to school, how'd we make it all work, and then we talked of names. We liked Luke for a boy. I still remember that night in a parking lot, when we mapped out our life on a napkin and fell in love with the baby.

Her parents flipped out though. I still remember telling them, in my job interview clothes and holding her hand. They had been teen parents and I kind of thought they'd take it better. They flipped out. Her dad yelled horrible, horrible nonredeemable stuff. Her mom nodded along. They said they hadn't raised her to ruin her life.

I took her from there because christ my dad was a pos but he never talked to me that way. I couldn't let her dad, God she worshipped her dad, talk to her that way. And I tried to make her feel ok, but god that wrecked her. It really did. I dropped her off later that night and she smiled a little when we talked about the baby, and that was the last time she would.

Her dad told her flat out that if she didn't give the baby up for adoption he would not be able to look at her or respect her. He went on and on and on- he told her the kid would never forgive her. That once the baby came I wouldn't finish school and she'd never gone and the kid would grow up in a crappy apartment with a dad who delivered pizza and hated his mom. All lies...and spewed with this deep hatred.

So she told me we couldn't keep him, that if we did we wouldn't last- it'd break us up and he'd hate us. She told me that'd we be strong for him and then we'd be strong for each other. And we gave him up. To a really wonderful couple. And maybe it was best for him, but god I gave away my kid and I don't think that will ever go away.

Afterwards, we were like zombies she used to touch my face and say ""He had your nose"" or ""I think his chin would have been like yours"". I remembered the weight of him when I held him and that life we planned out with him. Finally one day no long after she couldn't look at our face anymore. We broke up. Which made everything worse for me. It made it worse for her too. She just stopped...everything.

I could forgive her parents, I think, if that were all. But then her teen brother's girlfriend got pregnant and suddenly they were accepting grandparents. You can imagine what a betrayal that felt like for us. In the end, she couldn't live in that house with a baby and it brought us together, again. This time we mourned together.

We got married two years ago and I did finish my tech degree. She graduates in May with her LPN. We are happy, really we are. But there is a shadow of what might have been that will never stop. And now we are having a baby, a planned baby. She's only three months along but we are really excited. I hope it's a little girl.

We've only seen her parents a handful of times since then. Each time brief, but I can't forgive them and I don't see how I can. I didn't type out all the horrible things her dad said, before the baby, after, and when she moved in with me.

I told her that she is doing what she wanted to do and makes a difference. I agreed that teachers are underpaid, and told her if she valued a higher salary that she should definitely pursue that. 

Apparently April told her entire family what I was making at my new job. I was really upset about this. I consider that very personal and not anyone's business but ours. It wasn't long after that her brother made a comment about how it wasn't fair that he was making less than me because he has been working longer than me. That made absolutely no sense to me. 

Her sister, with two degrees, made the same comments. Except she works in a fast food restaurant- and has for the last 12 years in a non-managerial role. Her degrees are in Creative Writing and Psychology. 

Her dad also made a comment about me making more than him now. He works for the state government and I had to convince him that he was still coming out on top with his great benefits, retirement, etc. Why it was up to me to convince him, I have no idea.

Here we are a few years later. As I have received raises, bonuses, etc the commentating from April's family has gotten worse. They refer to me as ""the 1%"" and how I should be paying more taxes. They have made comments about how someone with my ""limited education"" shouldn't be making more than any of them. They have stated multiple times how I should go by lotto tickets with how lucky I am to be getting paid what I do. It has started to eat at me. 

It all blew up over the weekend. I lost my shit. Her dad and sister were over at our house and he was talking about a new girlfriend his brother has. He said he couldn't relate to her because she was ""uneducated and he has nothing to say to those kinds of people"". He said this right in front of me and I finally just lost it. It was like 5 years of me grinning and bearing it blew up. I have never been confrontational with April's family so I guess to them, it came from nowhere.

I told him that I was uneducated by his definition, so he has nothing to say to me either? He gave a weak excuse about ""well, that is different.. you have experience..."" and I told him that this other girl had experience too. I told him that writing people off because they didn't follow his same path of education was incredibly demeaning. I also told him I didn't appreciate the offhand comments about my salary, my lack of a college degree, and I would appreciate it if they kept their jealousy under a tighter lid next time they come to my house that my lack of education pays for. I felt really bad... and really good all at the same time. They left under awkward silence. 

And April totally ripped me. She said I was being unfair. I told her I have heard enough of their comparisons of me to Donald Trump. I am not fucking rich. I make a decent living and provide for my family. I take pride in that. I love my daughter with everything I have and I want the best for her. I told her the way her family, including her, have been treating me has been pretty damaging to myself self-confidence and I didn't appreciate it. And I wasn't going to tolerate her Dad coming to our house and acting like an asshole. She said, ""well.. that's just how my dad is."" 

It also gets worse. It is really sad that I have to say this is the worst part. I accepted a new job a few days ago. I spent the last few years paying for my own additional training, networking, taking on projects at work etc. I accepted a role as a Sr System Architect for a cloud provide. They offered me a generous $105k/yr and a month vacation. And my wife basically made me feel like shit for it.

She literally broke down into tears. She said, varbatim, she can't be happy for me. I don't even fucking understand how that is possible. She said she doesn't like her job and it is sad that I am going to be making 2.5x as much as she is even though she has a degree and I ""have nothing"". I didn't know how to respond. After a few minutes to collect my thoughts I told her that she shouldn't be happy for me. I told her she should be happy for us. I also told her if she was unhappy with her job she should just quit and stay home with our daughter. Or find a part time job. 

The real sick thing about this though... is that I am starting to believe the shit her family has been saying. Maybe I don't deserve what this new job is going to pay me. I feel like I have been conditioned to think that if someone went to college, they are immediately better than me. 

And I think April has been conditioned of that too. She isn't a bad person, although my story may paint her in a harsh light. But I think her family has pushed the ""you must go to college or you will be a complete failure"" and she doesn't know how to reconcile that someone who didn't go to college isn't a complete failure. 

Trust me, I am not bashing college. I am not anti-college. I wish I went to college. I am under no illusion that multiple doors were probably closed to me and it took my longer to break into this field without a degree. I want my daughter to go to college because it will help. It just wasn't for me at that time in my life and I made the best I could out of the situation. 

So I have 3 real questions:

1) How do I get out of the mindset where I am starting to internally believe this nonsense? I don't know how to even describe it. I logically know that their bullshit isn't true... but there is part of me doubting that and it is affecting my self confidence. I am starting to feel guilty for being successful professionally.

2) How do I get April and I on the same page? We have had some rocky times in our marriage, but we have worked through them. But I almost feel guilty now for trying to be the best I can be professionally, because I know it just makes her feel like shit. Maybe I am defending her a little too much by laying the blame with her family.. I don't know. When she said she couldn't be happy for me that I got a new job that would put us into a comfort of living outside of our friends and both of our families... it crushed me. 

3) How do I handle her family? I am not very confrontational and I feel bad about how I reacted to the underhanded comment her Dad made the other day. I told April I didn't want an apology- I just want her family to be clear that they wouldn't be welcome over at my house if they weren't going to be respectful of either of us. And I felt that them acting like they have towards me is being disrespectful to not only me, but to her as well. 

   
**tl;dr**: Despite my lack of education, I have been successful. But my wife and her family have treated me bad enough to the point where I feel like I should feel guilty for it and I don't deserve to be successful.

EDIT: RIP My inbox. Holy shit. I really appreciate it guys. This makes me feel A LOT better. Couple things:

1) To the ""this is made up, etc etc"" crowd. I wish it was. I am glad I could at least entertain you? Maybe I should go get a degree in creative writing.... 

2) To everyone else, I really appreciate it. A lot of strong advice. I plan on discussing things with my wife and have a lot of great information here. I didn't try to paint her as a bad person. I don't really think she is. I think she is just having a problem reconciling her beliefs she was raised with, what her teachers taught her, what college taught her, etc isn't 100% factual. I think she is also burned out in her profession. I know there is a big upheaval with the whole Common Core push in the US and many teachers are battling this. I don't know enough to make an educated opinion on it to be honest. I just know it stresses her out. We are also new parents- our daughter is 3. I think there is just A LOT going on right now contributing to it and she is calling into question some core beliefs she holds. Just a lot going on... I really want to make sure I handle it appropriately with her. 

3) I have a shit ton of private messages about ""How do I get to where you are?"". I want to reply to everyone, but I found myself repeating myself over and over. One thing to keep in mind... in 2016, tech is VERY different than 2006. It is faster, smarter, and changing rapidly. It is exponential. Instead of laying out, ""do this, this, and this... and you will be successful!""... I am going to give some tips with some of my own experience that I think are timeless and universal. 

* I always looked for ""bridge jobs"" as I call them. A bridge takes you from a place you are familiar, to a place that is unfamiliar. And carries you over something impassable. I look for two things- a) A job that I have the skills to do. You do not want to oversell yourself on your resume. You do not want to BS in an interview. In technology, once you are past entry level jobs... you WILL be on panel interviews with technical interviewers. You will be asked tough questions.  And B) will teach you something new. You need to be able to get something new from this position. That is the ""bridge"". Take your existing skillset to start across the bridge, and finish it by learning a new one. Don't look down because it is scary as fuck, but keep going. Once you are familiar with your new location.. it is time to start that bridge again. I am sure this is explained better somewhere else, but it is how I drew it out (I am very visual.. probably why I love system infrastructure/diagrams). 

* Network. And I don't mean go learn routing, subnetting, MPLS circuits, VPN encryption, etc. (Those are all good, though!). I mean meet people in IT in your local area. A lot of it will come naturally through vendors, through job interviews, through coworkers, etc. But go to local tech meetups. You will be surprised how many people you run into again over the years. When I first started out- I was on tech forum asking ""how do I get in IT?"". Another new guy was there and we kept in touch over the years every now and then. Guess what? He is at the company I am going to work at. We have never met before until now. Small world. I interviewed for jobs in the past. Guess what? Some of my interviewers are at this new job. Make sure you stay in contact with these people. 

* Find a mentor. This was a huge thing for me. I was very fortunate enough to have a Sr Exchange/Windows admin take me under his wing while I was a Help Desk guy. He would toss me easy projects, walk me through issues, etc to give me the experience. That is how I transitioned my Help Desk experience to a Sys Admin role years ago. He has long sense moved on to a large company, Rackspace, and we keep in touch every now and then (typically during baseball season... speaking of which...) 

* This deserves its own line... do. not. lie. on. your. resume. This is a career-killer in tech, especially if you are in a small job market city. I can't tell you how many times I have interviewed someone who puts something on their resume because they read about it. That person never got another interview. Only put things on there that are personally your own accomplishments. In IT, you will be interviewed in a panel format (or at least I have). Once you move past operations/admin roles, and into engineering, you will be asked to whiteboard a lot. Explain why you are deploying systems in the way you are. You will be asked to question your own thoughts and ideas. You will be pushed until they reach the wall where you don't know. And do not be afraid to say ""I don't know"". Having someone who can recognize their limitation and be able to find an answer is much more valuable than someone who has no fear of the unknown. A fuck up in my current role (the one I'm about to leave) can cost my company millions. That isn't an exaggeration. 

Today, from an interviewing point of view (I'm not a manager btw, so take this from a grain of salt), if you don't have a college degree... I look for someone who shows aptitude and attitude. Obtain some entry level certs in the field you want to specialize in. Like networking? Cisco owns the market share for a reason. Your CCENT and CCNA is a powerful cert to get. Want to be a server guy? You should probably aim for either Windows or Linux certs (Red Hat is a popular flavor... I have my RHCA and it has helped a bit). Like virtualization? VMWare and Microsoft's Hyper-V. My point is... get certifications. And do not be afraid to take an entry level help desk/desktop support job.

So what do you do after you get that job? You have to show interest and aptitude. We have 40 Help Desk folks on staff here. 30 of them will be in that role forever. 10 of them show promise. I have had 2 actually come and ask for help. So I do what was done to me about 7 years ago... I have helped them. I give them small things to do. It gives them experience and they can say they have done it in an enterprise environment. Those guys are both working on our system team. One is probably going to replace me when I leave- that dude is a rock star. This falls under both Get a Mentor, Networking, and Bridge Jobs. Show an interest. 

I will try to reply to more personal messages, but I thought I would give back to so many who offered advice and was looking for some advice in return.

First of all:

Thanks for all the supportive messages and replies to my post from three days ago. I admit that I hadn't done any research on what being introverted entails before submitting my post. I admit that I was wrong, and that I realize that introverts can, indeed, be good with people and be the life of a party. Excuse my ignorance please; it's just something I had never dealt with before.

Now to the actual update:

Please don't crucify me, but I reached out to someone that knows him very well (they were childhood friends (I know that's contradictory to what I said about my boyfriend, but I don't know what else I should call this guy), and they went to college and med school together), I wanted to get someone else's perspective and got a lot more than I had hoped for. 

Here's the gist of what he told me:

Apparently my boyfriend is a complete sociopath, has cheated on every girlfriend he has ever had (multiple times) and probably has cheated on me too. He poisoned his ex girlfriend's dog because he felt like she was not giving him enough attention, his parents rely on him for money (his mother can't work, and his dad works a low paying job), and he controls all their finances.

Now, all of these things could be lies, but how could I possibly know? As far as I know, this guy has no reason to lie about things like that, but what do I know?

I can't even 'investigate' any further, since I simply don't know any more people that have ever been close to him (he doesn't use any social networks). Said 'friend' has urged me to get out of the relationship ASAP, but I'm just shocked. He has been nothing short of amazing to me. I don't want any of these allegations to be true.

**TL;DR: His old 'friend' told me that my boyfriend isn't the man that I know and that I should leave before he destroys my life.**

**EDIT:** Okay, so I need to clear some things up. To the people who have said that this appears to be a creative writing exercise: I am way too shitty of a writer. English isn't my first language, and I don't work in a field where writing is of much importance. 

Secondly: Where my boyfriend and I live, people are 'real', full-time working doctors at his age. No residency or anything like that.

I have also asked the guy that I have messaged about the ex girlfriend, and he has given me her name and Facebook profile. I have messaged her, but she has not yet responded.

Thanks for all the advice. I will update as soon as I know more.

**EDIT 2**: I have decided that I will confront my boyfriend tomorrow morning with what his 'friend' has said about him. He is at work right now, but he'll get home in a few hours. I'll post an update then.

**Long story short**: It's all good!

**Long story, uh, long**: OP's wife here. He showed me this post as we were having our much-needed conversation, and wow, it got a lot of replies.

First, I was blown away by all the support in the comments. I wanted to let everyone know that I've been fine for the most part. This miscarriage was sudden and unexpected and neither of us knew how to feel about it but we've come to terms about it, and hopefully in the near future we'll have a more positive result.

Secondly, to add some context to the previous post, we're Indian (/u/Adariel was accurate) and in our culture, it's kind of a given that you help your parents out as they grow older. It's also a common thing for parents to have long visits and what not. 

Third, my husband is a good guy. I can understand the vitriol coming his way over failing to see his parent's past behaviour, but the thing is, *neither* of us were able to believe his parents capable of such behaviour. He hasn't spent much time with his parents - growing up, he stayed with an aunt and cousin to attend school, and with his grandparents during his college days, so he's never actually spent extended periods of time at home to note their behaviour. The most time I've spent with them in the past was a week, and my parents were there too during that time.

Okay, onto the actual update:

After he kicked his parents out, my husband (Jack) came down to my brother's apartment to, in his words, ""take me home."" Before he did though, we had a long, long conversation and spoke about everything (which is how we came to the first and third points mentioned before). My brother was a champ and lent us his apartment for the night to give us privacy. I asked Jack what his plans with his parents were, and he told me he's not going to let them back into our lives unless they apologize. If they do, then we'll allow them to see any future children - but it will always be supervised, and they will *never* be left alone with them. He's on my side 100%, and apologized for taking his parents side. He told me it was hard for him to believe his parents - whom he'd always held in high esteem - were capable of behaviour like that. I cried with him. I can't imagine what he's going through, having to cut your parents out of your life like that. But I am glad he's on my side. We'll be going for a few sessions of counselling together, and I'm hoping to persuade him to go individually too, to handle this whole cutting-parents-out situation.

The next day he booked a hotel room for the two of us, asked me to spend the day doing whatever I wanted, to kick back and order room service. He then organized for cleaners to clean our apartment up so I wouldn't have to do anything! He even got the carpets steam cleaned, I was amazed! The room service was amazing - I'm a bit sad about having to cook now, haha. We're now firmly back home and it's good to be here, just the two of us. 

As for his parents, they've flown to stay with his aunt Sandra - in my view the best place for them, because she takes absolutely no BS at all. He was going to call her and her know what happened, but she ended up calling him the night his parents landed there, asking why we'd kicked them out. He told them exactly what happened. told her not to let them spread rubbish against me, and she told him she'd take care of it. He also called a few of his close cousins to let them know what happened, so now if his parents try to drive his family against us, they can't :) She called up again last night, telling us how frustrated they were that no one seemed to sympathize with them. Jack told me that he heard his mom screaming in the background about the devil her son had married and Sandra yelled back at her ""you're the devil, hold your tongue"". Apparently when my MIL got married to my FIL, her MIL expected her to wait hand and foot on her, and do all the chores, so and and so forth, and she was waiting for Jack to get married so she could get the same treatment in return. It kind of explains why his father didn't say anything either - he's been used to his mother (Jack's grandma) treat his wife (Jack's mom) that way, so he didn't blink an eye when his wife yelled those things at me. I actually sometimes feel a little sorry for his mom, being married to someone who let them be treated that way. I hope that his parents spending time with Sandra will knock some sense into them, and they'll understand that unless they apologize, they won't have anyone to support them.

Oh, and we spoke to my parents as well, and cleared things up with them. I think they consider Jack more a son than they did before now! And while we've both thanked my brother several times, we've called him over the next weekend and we're going to be taking him out to a great dinner, and I'm making him *lots* of the food he likes to take back with him. If you have any other suggestions on how to thank him, let me know!

Okay, so that's everything I think. We're now going to go binge-watch Dr. Who and order pizza. Thanks again for all your replies!

**tl;dr**: Jack kicked his parents out, told them not to contact us again unless it's an apology. His aunt is hopefully trying to knock some sense into them.

I've always dreamed of a big wedding, not extravagant to any extreme, but that's just how all my family and friends' weddings have been and ever since I was a little girl I knew that's what I wanted. 


My husband is very pragmatic and from the start was very critical of the wedding I'd planned in my head. We debated what we'd do pretty extensively and I thought came to some really good compromises. I always wanted a really great photographer, he thought hiring a photographer at all was pointless, so our compromise was asking a friend to be our photographer as his wedding gift to us. I always wanted a big, Saturday night party reception, he wanted a courthouse wedding with just us, so our compromise was a Sunday brunch with select friends and family. I always wanted my sister as my MOH and my two BFFs from growing up as bridesmaids, he, again, just wanted the two of us, so our compromise was my father got to walk me down the aisle. I wanted a band, he doesn?t like dancing, so our compromise was me making a playlist of background music for the brunch.


The day was wonderful and I was so happy and it really was such an awesome wedding. 


Then my brother got married.


He had, basically, my dream wedding. Ever since then, the resentment has been growing steadily. All of our friends and family were there and everyone had the absolute best time. It hands down was a better day for me than my wedding day. It was such a beautiful celebration of not only the love between my brother and my new sister-in-law, but of them as a couple and everyone they loved enough to include in their special day. My grandfather read a prayer, she had a first dance with her father, they had beautiful flowers and a killer band, everyone danced all night, including my husband!! 


The real kicker was her dress. If I had to pick out the dress of my dreams, it was what she wore. When she came out everyone gasped and my husband actually said, ?wow?. It broke my heart. I wanted that moment for myself so badly, I know that makes me sound like a shallow attention queen, but it?s true. I had actually picked out a discount dress for my own wedding, but my husband said it was probably too fancy for the venue, so I went with a white sundress. 


The wedding was awhile ago and they just uploaded the album to facebook and I sat there going through it sobbing. Our friend did take a few nice photos of the day, but it was nothing like what they had. Theirs had captured so many beautiful moments throughout the day, beautiful pictures of them and everyone who I loved but was unable to even have at my wedding. 


I know this is such a stupid issue, and it?s not like he did anything wrong since we did come to logical compromises that I fully agreed with at the time, but I have been feeling more and more resentful and I don?t know what to do about it.


EDIT: Wow, okay I get it. Thanks for the overwhelming feedback. I am being superficial and shallow, he was definitely right. I'm going to do my best to forget about it completely and be grateful for the compromises he was willing to make.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3oichh/how_do_i_get_my_32f_husband_34m_to_wear_a_wedding/

The gist of the original post was that my husband has never worn a wedding ring in our 8 years of marriage because we used to live in a country where it was not the social norm. And then we moved to a country where it was the social norm. I started wearing a ring, and wanted him to do so too. My husband hates wearing jewelry, and didn't want to start wearing a ring just because everyone else does.

So I heard what all of you had to say and the overwhelming majority of you wanted me to just let him be. Some of you gave suggestions on what I could say to make my argument more convincing. And some of you suggested some compromises. I decided to side with the majority, and not make a big deal about it.

I didn't plan on saying anything to him and thought I would just let the issue slide. But last night as we lay in bed, talking to each other about how our day went, I kind of ended up telling him that I asked this question on reddit and added that most redditors supported his stance. In conclusion I told him that I respect his wish, and that if he didn't want to wear a ring, I wouldn't press him to do so. 

He was silent for a bit, and then kissed me and said,""I didn't know you felt so strongly about this issue that you had to go post in reddit asking for advice. If it really means that much to you, I'll try to wear it.""
I felt very very guilty when he said that, because I know how much he hates jewelry and that he was only really trying to make me happy. 

That's when I remembered some of the compromise solutions you folks posted, and suggested that he needn't wear it 24/7 and that I would be more than happy if he could wear it only for special occasions. I emphasized, over and over, that if he preferred not to wear it at all, I would honestly be fine with that too.

He thought about what I said and replied,""Honestly, that sounds quite fair. It is a good compromise. I'll wear it on special occasions. I'm definitely willing to do that for you.""
And he kissed me again :)

So, all is good :) And that's how we resolved this issue.
Thanks reddit, for all the honest comments and awesome suggestions. I appreciate it very much !

First, thank everyone who responded. I was very surprised to see the outpouring of people who could relate/had helpful advice. I'm sorry I didn't respond to everyone, but I'm very thankful.

I want to say that I kind of fudged the part about her being my aunt. She's not really, she's my mom's distant cousin that happens to live in our town. I was looking for a job and my mom saw on Facebook she asked for someone to babysit her kid. So, she's not technically close family even. I just didn't want the post to be specific because I don't know if who was involved goes on reddit, but I don't care anymore.

So, what happened was I talked to my not-really-aunt the day before I had to leave to go on my school trip to Europe. I kind of planned this in a way that she couldn't try to talk me back into while I was gone, since I had no access to texting. 

The day before I talked to my aunt I told my mom everything and how my school work was being affected and that it wasn't helping out family anymore, it was being taken advantage of and all of the points that were brought up by other redditors. She finally agreed that it was wrong of me to be doing, and that her son should watch the kid or someone else who actually could control the kid better (I'm not sure if I mentioned this in the last post, but the kid I babysit has increasingly become badly behaved. One day I dyed my hair brown and she said ""why would you do that? you look like a f*cking monster"" as an example.). 

So, onto the drama. When my not-really-aunt dropped me off at my house, I stayed in the car so I could talk to her and I said that I would be unable to continue watching Kid when I returned from school. She immediately tried to say that that wasn't possible, she doesn't have anyone else, ect. I touched on a few points such as:

- My grades are failing
- I am taking a college class and finals are coming up, I need to study.
- I cannot control her kid well enough anymore (the kid wasn't in the car during this conversation, her brother was watching her at the time). 
- I am not being paid enough. She tried to convince me at this point she would pay me more soon. I told her I didn't want more money I just didn't want to babysit anymore.
- I told her to look for other babysitters. I told her to go to care.com (I always see the commercials.. I figured I might as well try something).

At the end of it all, she basically told me that if I wasn't there to babysit the Monday I got back then she would be extremely disappointed and called me selfish and said that I didn't care for family. At this point I was kind of annoyed and I just got out of the car and went inside. I asked my mom to go talk to her because I kind of figured she wouldn't take me seriously. 

My mom lied to her and said that I could no longer work (like it was a punishment) because my grades were failing. She got pretty irritated and made a remark about how I wasn't ""adult enough"" to handle working and schoolwork at the same time and that made my mom pretty mad and they got in a fight about it. I'm glad that my mom stood up for me, though :)

Anyways, after that things seemed okay. I got back and didn't go to babysit (there was a few texts like ""maybe next year you could help again!"" and i was just thinking ""nope."")

My younger sister 2 years ago was sick. She did not get better. She has cancer and the prognosis is good (not fabulous but good). For the record this is all I am going to say about my sisters condition. Thank you for understanding.

Couple of weeks ago she (my sister) started to lose her hair. Her bf freaked out, it prompted him to leave and it was a totally shitty time. She decided to shave it off earlier this week but she did it alone when she was vulnerable and instead of feeling empowered and in control it left her devasted and worse than ever.

Whilst she was crying in my dad's arms, I left the house walked to the nearest barber shop and came back 45 minutes later (yeah I had a bit of a cry too) to show her that her hair is definitely not what makes her beautiful and that I really am with her. 

I did not do a big selfie of side by side picture or ""if you share this 50k times then she will be cured"" bs on social media because I'm not interested and she would definitely not be down for it. Definitely not. 

My pal, Emma, I went to University with. I graduated 3 years ago and our relationship was close friends at the time but now.. more like friendly Facebook friends. 

I suppose my haircut was more gossip material than I realised because even without posting a picture a lot of people sent me messages saying messages for my sister and for me saying how brave I was- they were kind and I'm not going to get angry at them because it's true. I did shave my head. The world is gonna know sooner or later!

But Emma tagged me in a picture this week and she has shaved her head. In support of my sister who she has never met. This makes me very uncomfortable. I used to think she was quite.. well rather selfish and liked being in the spotlight and this only reinforces this image of her. I'm just frustrated because she has included a message of ""share to support bald sisterhood sister in this time"" and it's like.  Er. Okay? 

My sister saw it and laughed. She goes on Facebook maybe 6 times a year. She has bigger things to worry about like I dunno - cancer. 

I sent Emma a message thanking her for her kind words and gesture, it was rather left field but that it was nice to know strangers cared.

It's escalated enormously in the last 2 days. She has started a Facebook group, she shares pictures of her posing with her new hairstyle  (at times not evening mentioning my family or any cancer patient struggles at all) multiple times a day and I honestly think she's going to start asking for money. 

I sent her a message essentially saying ""okay.. enough is enough. Let's not forget that my sister is the patient here. I would like this to remain a private family matter. Please stop tagging me in your photos and stop this Facebook group and asking for shares"" amongst other things like it was a sweet gesture but I had worried it had snowballed.. I put it nicely!

She saw the message and its got worse. She just posted a picture that got 4k+ shares and comments and like I said no mention of me. But without that mention.. this is going to sound crazy but I think she's trying to slowly make it look like she has cancer or is sick. 

I need to stop this. Neither my sister or my family want or need this. What do you think I should do? I feel good writing this out. Thanks reddit.

Firstly, thank you all for your comments and advice.  My gut knew that I had to end the relationship, but I needed a kick in the pants to actually do it.


The apartment we live in is actually owned by my uncle, with whom I am very close.  I live there for free while attending grad school (it is part of a building he owns, and was his way of helping me afford to further my education).  He had no problem with my boyfriend also living there, on the condition that he help out with managerial duties and repairs around the building.  I called my uncle and told him the circumstances, and he called Jack and told him he needs to find a new place to live.  He's not on a lease or anything, so hopefully it won't be a legal issue.


I haven't responded to Jack in any way since yesterday.  I returned to the apartment this afternoon (after going to the Dr. to get tested for STDs...thankfully clear so far).  Jack was there.  Since he spoke with my uncle, he knew that I was breaking up with him and wanted him out.  He immediately tried to argue with me, saying once again that the whole thing had been intended as a gift for me!  I just ignored him as I went around the place packing his things.


He also said that the only reason he started without me was that he wanted to get used to the two of them together, so things wouldn't be ""awkward"" when I arrived.  Apparently he thought having sex with her first would make the threesome ""go smoother"".  I didn't even look at him, just kept packing.  I'm proud of myself that I didn't cry.  I think I was past the point of crying?


He kept blabbering on, saying that he just wanted to ""test the waters"" with the other person so that when the time came they could both focus totally on me.  The final straw was when he said that I was being ""totally unreasonable and ungrateful for the effort he was putting into our sexual relationship"".  I stared at him for a minute, and then I just started laughing.  I couldn't control it.  I must have laughed hysterically for a full minute.  He got angry but finally shut up and stopped trying to justify himself.


I asked for his key, and then told him to leave.  I said that he could call to arrange a time to come pick up all his things, but not to contact me for any other reason.  His parents live in the same city, so I know he has somewhere to stay.  He left, looking pretty forlorn.


I didn't ask how long he'd been cheating on me.  Just knowing about the one incident was enough.  He's obviously not the person I thought he was.  I don't feel like I even know him anymore.


I'm still sad, but I'm going to be okay.  There's no way I could keep someone like that in my life.  


Thanks again for all the encouragement and motivation to end it for good.  I knew the truth in my heart, but I needed to know I wasn't crazy.

Hi Reddit! I've received a few requests to make a follow-up posts, so I'm back! Before I start, I want to thank everyone for their kindness and their support. Some of you guys gave me some really great advice, and I honestly couldn't thank you enough. Of course, there were a few trolls in my last post, and I want to go off topic for a bit to tell any prospective assholes to *please* stay off my posts. The anti-muslim rhetoric these days has really shaken me up, and I deal with plenty in real life without you guys bringing it online.

About three weeks ago- the Saturday after I made my original post- I sat down with my mom and I told her about how I didn't want to wear the hijab. I like to think that it wasn't a complete surprise, because I've definitely been loosening it up over the past few years, but it was still a painful conversation. We both cried and said some very painful things, but our first conversation ended at an impasse. The next day, we sat down and had a very honest discussion. I told her that I loved and respected both her and our religion, but the hijab was ultimately my decision and she couldn't force me. She agreed, but with the stipulation that I participate in events at our mosque more often and make more religious friends- which is a fair enough compromise, so I agreed.

Talking to my dad was a little harder, because we're not very close, but he was pretty calm and understanding throughout. He told me that even though no one on his side of the family wore the hijab, he liked it when I did because he always saw it as a good thing. Ultimately, he left the decision up to me, but asked that I wear it to family events for a little while so that people wouldn't get the wrong idea.

I'm not going to say my mom and I are 100% okay, but she's handling it remarkably well. We'll go out and shop together, or hang out around the house and just talk and she won't treat me any differently. After those first two days, we haven't really had an in-depth conversation about me wearing the hijab, but she does ask that I wear it around certain people for now so that people won't unnecessarily gossip. I completely understand, because my mom is a pretty well-known figure in our community, and I would never want my decisions to reflect poorly on her. We both agreed that I'll handle it in phases, and that I'm not going to wear it at college or at work or when I'm with my friends, but family and mosque events need me to be more covered-up. I actually move in to college tomorrow, so wish me luck with that!

It's a little silly, but now that I'm not wearing the hijab I have so many inane problems to deal with. I completely skipped 9 years worth of haircare experience, so I have NO idea how to style it, or what to do other than just throwing it up into a ponytail. I've definitely noticed that people treat me differently, too. Service people at stores are a lot more friendly and I've gotten cat-called a few times (which is really uncomfortable, but I guess that's life?) I'm also a little nervous about posting stuff to instagram, or changing my social media profile pictures, because not a lot of people know yet, but I figure I'll take things as I go. Once more, I want to thank all of you guys for your kindness and support!

http://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qpcqj/update_me_25_mf_found_out_five_nights_ago_that_my/


I'm back in the UK for a few weeks visiting some old friends and family (and my old boss!) and I thought I'd write an update. As some of you might have read 4 months ago I broke up with my ex after she cheated on me. This spurred me to accept a job offer in Africa, and the rest is history. 


Firstly, Africa is the most incredible continent in the world. I'm based in the Tanzania but I've been fortunate enough to do a lot of travelling. The new job is incredible, getting some crazy experience, got my own driver and secretary, making some really big differences here and I think accepting this job was the best decision of my life. I'll be sad to leave at the end of the year. 



In terms of how I'm dealing with the break up, this has been the perfect perfect way to deal with it. It's hard to wallow for too long when you're riding around dirt roads and are sat with new friends sharing beer and looking at the most stunning natural beauty you'll find. One of the perks of the job is that we work closely with NGOs who send out lots of aid workers/volunteers around my age who are all still looking to have a good time. I'm still single and it's been great to recapture my youth and go out and be free and make some new life experiences. On another thread someone said that at the start of every good story/adventure requires something like what happened to me to occur, to expose myself and make myself a bit braver than I would have been. I loved that, H has really just been the first half a paragraph in a story that's been so enjoyable and invigorating. 


Here's the 'break up porn' that I had to update you all on. This is proof that no matter how bad it is now, things can change, and once you heal the dynamics of power can fundamentally shift in an instant.  I've maintained NC with H. I've been updated by some friends that after she found out I left she asked all my friends if they know my African number (she's blocked from all email/social media/my phone) and has been living with her parents for months now having decided to spend some time on her own. Bear in mind I've not seen her since this all kicked off, or spoken to her. When I landed in London a few days ago guess who is waiting for me in arrivals (apart from my Mum of course). H. H comes from nowhere and kind of looks at me and starts crying. I was kind of speechless to be honest. H had seen the flight details I'd posted on the wall of a mutual friend and taken a 4 hour train down to London to ask me to take her back. (Bear in mind this entire time my Mum is hovering in the background) 


I told H nothing had changed, thanked her for coming (I was genuinely touched by whatever this display was) and gave her some money to get a cab home (partly because she was a wreck, partly to make myself feel superior). At this point it really struck me how much everything had changed, I definitely still have some feelings for H but they're couched much more reflectively, I felt extreme pity for her at that moment, and I don't think I've ever felt so sure that being on my own is what's best for me. 



Thanks for all the support /r/relationships, some of the advice I received on here has made a huge difference to how I've spent the last 4 months. For those of you just starting your journey, it gets better. Maintain no contact, look after yourself, go to the gym and make time to meet new people. I recommend taking yourself out on your own, it helps you figure out who you are and what you lost.

Sorry for the novel length post.


I cooled off and confided in friends, every one of whom supported me in refusing to let Kole anywhere near my daughters. I?m sorry I didn?t get a chance to reply to anyone on the original thread before it got locked (not sure why that happened?). One thing I wanted to say is, I reread the title of my post and cringed ? I did NOT intend to demonize anyone with schizophrenia. I still don?t think Kole?s diagnosis is connected to his past actions.


On Monday I got calls from both of Rob?s other kids. They were both in college by the time Kole was 15, but Dan[31M] was pretty close to him at some points, and they both agreed with me. I?ve calmed down enough to see some middle ground between having him move in, and keeping him institutionalized far away, so we?re all going to talk it over this weekend.


Later, Rob finally called me and apologized. I sucked it up and apologized for calling his son a piece of shit and for blowing up at him immediately after the call. When Rob came home it was just us (daughters are staying longer at my ex?s), and we had a very emotional but calmer conversation. Rob had stayed over with a good friend of his who?s known the family since before the kids were even born, who apparently said something to the effect of ?are you fucking serious??. Apparently when your wife, best friend, and two kids ALL say the same thing, well, you listen.


So the basement idea is officially DROPPED. Done, out the window. Thank GOD!! I was really prepared to hash it out again, move-out ultimatum and all. I?m glad I didn?t need to. He admitted I was right and there was too great a risk to my daughters, and apologized for pushing it. He said he wanted to believe that Kole didn?t really do all the things he admitted to, that they were actually delusions, but that was unrealistic. It wasn?t even from anything Kole said on the phone. But he rambled about Kole?s issues, molestation, maybe he was just really immature (17 dating a 15 y/o, sure, but 17 and 12? No.). He opened up more about the guilt of not knowing what was going on literally next door. I told him he needed to go back to therapy because I?m not the best person to talk to about it. I don?t think he really believes any of his justifications, but I can?t sit there and listen to him without getting upset. I don?t know how I was able to be supportive before all this.


A lot of people on the first post said Rob was an asshole for various reasons. Well, he?s not. He?s also not filthy rich and so well connected that he made charges disappear. It wasn?t like that. I was so angry when I wrote the original post that I said it flippantly. It took Rob a long time to open up about the situation to me, I mean YEARS before I knew the whole story, so I?m trying really hard to empathize with him as a parent, despite my disgust. He?s also not a violent person ? punching the wall was so extremely out of character, and he apologized for it.


So the biggest thing that happened was that yesterday Rob wound up trying to call Kole back, and got his case manager. She couldn?t talk for long, but confirmed that 1) yes, he?s schizophrenic, 2) he?s medicated (mostly), 3) he?s not on drugs, but has on/off drinking problems, and 4) he?s not violent to others (she says). I?m relieved to hear that, but of course it?s not the whole story. She said Kole?s will need a lot of support to function. Rob?s crushed about that, understandably. I?m conflicted ? I don?t want to feel bad for him, but hearing that was challenging. On the other hand, if he?s that impaired I can?t help but think he?s not even capable of harming anyone else, though of course I?m not going to say it.


He?s Rob?s kid, and it?s Rob?s choice what to do with him (subject to my boundaries). We?ll figure something out. Rob?s daughter has kids, and Dan probably will in a few years, so Kole definitely won?t be living with any of us. My kids will be back this afternoon and I?m not sure what I/we should tell them about the situation. My 15 year old texted me and asked if we were getting divorced :( I told her no, but she knows something?s up and I don?t know what to tell her.


**TL;DR:** Husband apologized, will NOT be bringing Kole into our house! We had a long, calmer talk with apologies on both sides. Rob?s now in touch with Kole?s caseworker, who confirmed that he?s schizophrenic, medicated, not violent (that she knows of), but isn?t very functional. We will be involving Rob?s other kids in figuring out a solution, and I?ll support him on the condition that Kole will never, ever set foot in this house or be around my daughters. Don?t know how to explain to daughters.

**Edit:** I had a long conversation with my daughters about the situation, sparing only the worst details. I also had another long conversation with Rob. He's planning to fly out ASAP once he gets an okay from case worker & Kole. We're reading up on schizophrenia and our resources, trying to make sure we're on the same page. Depending on how/if visiting goes, he wants to move him to an inpatient treatment place of some kind closer to us (but not TOO close).

I just wanted to update on my shitty vacation. The first day was really bad, I stuck to the hotel room for most of it and when I finally went out at night she tried to start fights and get me to stop talking to people because she thought I was going to ?cheat? on her. The front desk person found me another room that was a huge upgrade so I moved there for the rest of the trip to avoid my girlfriend. I guess she didn't stay in the old room either so I'm not sure who ended up paying for that but I was expecting a huge bill for shit she charged to the room. 


It was pretty awkward but I did my best to have a good time. I met a ton of people, and it was easy to make friends since everyone thought the situation was hilarious. My girlfriend never went too far away, she would approach me a couple of times every day to ""try and work things out so we can enjoy our vacation"" and she kept an eye on me the whole time. When I wouldn't talk with her she tried to start a fight and a couple times she actually screamed at me for everyone to hear. After it finally became clear to her that I was moving on she stopped bugging me and she flew out a couple days early. I ended up spending most of my time with a group that was there for a wedding and even attended the ceremony. I'd rate it a 7/10 vacation all things considered. 


I feel a bit bad about how shitty her trip was. I did some shit just to piss her off that probably wasn't necessary. I was hoping that she would be mad enough to just move out of my house before I got home but she's still living here with me and now I'm living in my own basement just to avoid her. I did give her an eviction notice but one month is far too long to be living with an ex.

Saturday was a family BBQ for mother's day and I happened upon a conversation I wish I had never heard. Her aunt, cousin and a family friend were talking about how happy they were to hear she was done having kids. How they would have never guessed her life would be this way. How she wasted her education, she should be a reporter like she dreamed of. That she should be married to Todd. Fucking Todd, her college boyfriend, who is a goddamn weather man now. They don't know what she sees in me. (Her cousin called me a fat sack of crap.) Why she ever married me. How she could be happy playing suzie homemaker. Thats not the girl they knew. The ambitious go getter. She shouldn't have the life we have together - she should have a better life. With less kids and more luxury and no me.


Well now I feel like a fat sack of crap. Never have these relatives ever given an inkling that they don't like me. Never has Sam ever given an inkling that she is unhappy. She did want to be a journalist and worked in print before we had kids but she gave that up to raise them hands on. I feel like shit over this and I don't know what to do or say about it.


Sam knows something is up. She knows I'm not my usual self and something is bothering me. She isn't pressing the issue but she has gone into nurture mode. She made my favorite dinner tonight just to cheer me up. Even made chocolate cake and homemade peanut butter ice cream. I wanted to cry. She's been extra flirty and flashed me some sexy panties and a wink while I was putting the kids to bed. It is all just making me feel worse. 


Normally I'd talk through any problem with her but what do I even say? ""Are you sorry you married a fat hairy bastard and had four kids with him?"" Do I tell her that her aunt was talking shit about her?

I want to leave. I am sick of living in a household where I am given the autonomy of a 5 year old. However, my parents have threatened to kill me if I were to ever leave the house. In their views, it is seen as an insult to them if I ran off, as they would be an embarrassment in front of others in the sense that they did not raise their daughter the ""proper"" way. I do believe that there would be a physical altercation if they did catch me leaving.



I am looking for advice on how I can get out. I am completely financially dependent. But how can I go about getting away with them watching my every step? What sort of precautions should I take?

OKAY, SO.
This issue has been driving me crazy lately to the point where I'm actually becoming stressed out about it pretty hardcore. I called one of my best girlfriends. I called my sister. I prepared an entire mental speech for him at my birthday party this Friday. I finally started to accept that it was time to lay my cards all out on the table.


Then, last night, we were just hanging out like we usually do; drinking a bottle of wine, playing music, drawing, talking about life. We ended up under the desk and he goes ""I'm gonna cuddle you"", so we cuddled. Nothing crazy yet.


But then we fell asleep cuddling, and the next thing I know he's sleepily pressing his face against my cheek and kissed it. I pulled back to look at him and see if he was for real and then he went in and kissed me.


Boom. Fireworks.


We talked a bunch after a really heavy makeout sesh, and it turns out that we have been exactly on the same page... for 3 years. This doesn't feel real. I was shaking and cried happy tears as he told me everything that was on his mind. I'm really excited to see where this goes... I've never felt this way about anybody before.

First Update:

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39z1ea/update_my_28f_husband_29m_invited_an_old_high/

So I sat at our agreed meeting place and we had agreed to meet at a half-past noon. I have the day off today, so I wasn?t bound to a schedule and showed up about ten minutes early. I waited and she arrived a little late, but I?m just glad she showed up at all. So we greet each other and she says it?s nice to finally get the chance to know me and to assure me that she did not tell Steve. Her assurance was nice, but I was well aware that anything she said could be completely false.

We talk and she does talk about her fianc? and showed me her ring and such.  I asked how they were doing and she said that it?s been great and how he proposed to her before he went on a business trip (and is currently still gone), and yes, I realize that what she said is a huge red flag. So she then asked me how Steve and I were doing. I told her that it hasn?t been going great and she seemed pretty surprised by my answer. Eve had asked what was wrong and I didn?t give her much detail other than the fact that Steve seemed to be distancing from himself from me. She then asked if this has been going on for long and I did NOT tell her that it started when she appeared, instead I just said that it started pretty recently. At this point she is flustered, I mean she is covering her face saying things like ?oh no?, and I?m just scared of what?s going on. I ask her what?s wrong and she says she thinks she might be part of the reason why he?s being distant.

I asked her why she thought that she was a part of the cause and she said that it might sound ridiculous but she thinks that Steve might still be hung up on her from high school. She apologized for saying it and asked me to please believe her because she was being completely honest. I asked if they had dated back in high school and she told me that they did not. It was that Steve was completely infatuated with her for all four years of high school and promised me that the only reason why she even agreed to meeting him again was because she thought he was over her, especially since Steve got married to me. I calmed her down and assured her I believed her and I asked her what they were like in high school. Her story matched up with the conclusion she gave me, and throughout she kept apologizing to me. She told me that she has never reciprocated to Steve?s feelings. I brought up the fact that Steve wouldn?t ever invite me to hang out with the both of them and she said that Steve told her that I just didn?t want to go or I was busy, hell, she even showed me texts as proof of him passing me off as antisocial.

Eve asked me what I was going to do, and I just told her that I was going to talk to Steve. That?s all I really can do at this point. We made some other small talk and then thanked each other for the lunch. So what I?ve been able to conclude so far:

1) Even if Eve and Steve were in kahoots with each other, even if Eve was trying to lie her way out of being in a physical affair with Steve, even if all of her remorse, story, and apologies were a great big pile of bull, it just seems so blatant to me that he is having an emotional affair, which is enough for me. 2) He?s a lying sack of shit that purposely kept Eve and I separated by telling her I had no interest in getting to know her and 3)I?m his rebound. It just seems as though I?ve always been his rebound now. She said that Steve and her separated after high school and lost contact and then that?s where I see myself coming into the story.

Eve was very nice and polite throughout the entire meal, but I will most likely let us go our separate ways after this. I do not regret meeting her for lunch whatsoever because I came for some closure and I got something. I am also going to consult my lawyer and see what I can do with this information. I do not see this marriage working out, especially if he?s this quick to abandon me for an old flame, and have already spend so many years of my life on this marriage. My sister is well aware of what has been going on and I am welcome to stay with her and I do intend to. When Steve comes home, he will get an earful and I?ll let him give his own side of the story, but until then, I?ll prepare myself. Thank you for all of your comments and I?ve appreciated all of them very much. I will try to update when I can.

837,habbnlg,Relationships,53jgdg,1712,"So as is evident by the title, my wife had her daughter very young. The father is not in the picture. I met my wife when she was 22 and her daughter, Rachel, was 6. We got married two years later, I officially adopted Rachel, and we've been very happy ever since. 

Rachel went off to college this year. She ended up taking a few summer courses and getting involved in some organizations, so she actually moved up to school in June instead of the traditional August. Rachel was extremely excited about going off to school, and I was excited for her, too. She's going to my alma mater and those 4 years were some of the best in my life; I have no doubt she's going to be very happy there, too. Her mom was not so excited. My wife has always been a bit on the protective side, and she and Rachel are incredibly close. 

But she's taking it to all new levels lately. I personally am taking the same approach my parents took with me when I went off to school: I text Rachel 2-3 times during the week just to see what she's up to, and I call and talk to her for about 30 minutes on Friday afternoons and maybe another 10 minute call on Sunday evenings. I think this is pretty normal. Rachel is an outgoing, fun, kind young lady. I know what college is like. I call her at times when I know she won't be out partying or on dates or whatever. I try to text her at times that I think she'd just be chilling in her dorm or just walking across campus. Calls before 11 am on Saturdays or Sundays don't happen. 

My wife, on the other hand...she is constantly texting Rachel. She calls her every evening and wants to have hour long chats. She practically begs her to come home every weekend (she goes to school about 3 hours away), and when Rachel says she can't, my wife offers to come up and visit her. Rachel has come home an average of 2 weekends a month since she's been at school, and my wife has been up there for ""girls' weekends"" three other times. About a month ago we went to visit Rachel. I booked a hotel for my wife and I and told Rachel we would take her and a friend, if she wanted, out to dinner. Maybe do a bit of shopping, walk around town, but nothing too crazy. Since it was a Friday night I figured we'd be done by 8 pm so Rachel could go out with her friends, and then we could grab lunch on Saturday (after the hangover wears off, hah) before heading home. My wife brought a sleeping bag and stayed in Rachel's room, and spent all evening with her as well as all day Saturday. 

This isn't healthy for either of them. I've spoken to Rachel about it and she says she wishes she had some more freedom, but doesn't want to hurt her mom. I get that. But Rachel is a young lady and she needs to be cut loose a bit. I don't want her being that weird girl who is always going home for the weekend, or who's mom spends weekends on her floor. She can't go out, have fun, do the stuff college kids are supposed to do. She can't gain her own identity. And my wife. This is her chance to have the bit of youth she never had because she was raising a kid. She needs to learn to cope with the empty nest syndrome. Eventually Rachel isn't going to come home twice a month or for the summer. She'll actually be *gone*, living her own life. College is supposed to be that transitional period and my wife is ruining that.

How do I help my wife? How do I get her to see what she's doing isn't what's best for either of them? I've suggested therapy, but it's received a lukewarm reaction. I don't know what else to do.

838,bigboobedgf44,? Locked Post ?,3lgroe,1706,"Roommate himself is 23m.

We have a very quiet and comfortable living situation. I lived with Troy (roommate) for about a year before Hannah (gf) moved in. It was an unexpected permanent move rather than temporary, but everyone gets along, and in fact Troy and I are closer because Hannah is the type of girl who is very outgoing and brings quiet, shy people out of their shells. 

Hannah's breasts are very large. They seem even larger than they may be due to the fact that Hannah is only 4'11. She jokes that she's 2/3 boob, even. Her biggest bras say 32K, the smallest say 32GG. She's typically modest with them, as she doesn't enjoy a lot of male attention. Not that I try to, but if I were to ask her to wear something ""revealing"" I don't even know that she'd have anything in her closet. She typically takes off her bra in the evening. Troy usually stays in his room and doesn't really socialized with us most of the time (no negativity, he's just a loner type, any time he does come out we all chat happily). There's never been any complaint about her bralessness. 

For the record, I can definitely say Hannah isn't Troy's physical type. She's a size 16, and he has a big preference for very skinny women. Not ""fit"" but just very skinny. So I honestly doubt he's looked at Hannah in any sexual way to begin with -- not to mention, like I said, she's generally modest and doesn't have them flopping around or anything. 

Troy and his gf (Jenna) are a new thing of the past 4 months. He's brought her over and we all hung out, and Jenna and Hannah got along extremely well. But a few days after, Jenna sent Hannah a message on FB asking her if she'd mind wearing a bra when Troy was around -- citing that it was inappropriate and kind of sleazy.

Hannah just shrugged it off and said sure, why not. So to compromise, she started weary a very flimsy sports bra. Things seemed like they were fine until Jenna came over again, and Hannah just happened to be coming home from the gym, was walking between our bedroom and the bathroom without a bra on (but was otherwise clothed). Jenna lost her shit and started yelling at Troy about this, and then called Hannah a tramp, a sleaze, etc. She brought up the way she loafs around in dresses and legs her ass hang out, etc etc. I'll admit that sometimes Hannah's dresses ride up when she's lounging on the couch with a book (which is pretty much always), but since day #1 anytime she heard Troy moving around the apartment closer to the living room, she sits up and straightens herself out to cover herself up. She does not like being looked at by men, like I said. 

Hannah didn't hear anything because she was in the shower, and when she got out, she asked where Jenna went and I had to explain that they had a fight. Hannah asked what'd happened, and Troy told her it was just nothing.

Jenna ripped into Hannah on Facebook, calling her all kinds of names and telling her that she's trying to steal Troy from her, etc etc. Hannah was hurt and she went to Troy to apologize about the bra thing and asked him if he's always had a problem with it and Troy said something like ""I didn't even know I was supposed to care.""

I don't know how to handle this. Obviously I'd prefer my girlfriend be comfortable and not be attacked, but I do want to know, Jenna's tirade aside -- IS it inappropriate for her to not wear a bra in her own home?

She agreed that was important, that she wanted it too, and thanked me for suggesting it. We are now planning one date event a week (going for a walk, watching a movie, having a glass of wine, cooking together, etc), and sending more fun, less logistics-related messages throughout the day.

She decides that a coworker is too friendly and is a threat to our relationship. I say no, that's silly, I talk to her because she sits next to me, is on the same team as me, and has a son the same age as our daughter so we swap baby stories. No I'm defending her over my wife, clearly I like her better than my wife, if I care about our marriage I won't talk to her anymore.

She decides video games are hurting our marriage. I play a few hours a week, tops (I'd LOVE to play more, and play with her co-op, but she interferes AGGRESSIVELY if I try to play and she's awake). I tried to play with a male coworker, I care more about friends than family. I try to play with a female coworker, oh god I am playing video games with other women instead of spending time with my wife (I never actually played with the female coworker). I want to play with my daughter, she yells at me for corrupting her and throws my 3DS across the room and tells me if I care about our relationship I'll destroy it.

She's had a lot of hard times, my mom knows it. My mom is worried about her, and we have a lot of private conversations about how to help her. Now I am conspiring against her with my mom who is trying to ruin our marriage (so far from fact). If I care about my wife I'll ignore my mom and not let her see her granddaughter.

Ditto that for my brother.

These are just a few examples. I've sat down with her and told her that she's interpreting things all wrong. She says I'm just calling her crazy and I need to listen to her. I say I am listening, and I do care, but she's just plain wrong. She won't go to a therapist because ""I just want someone on my side"" (conveniently ignoring that if I was wrong the therapist wouldn't be on my side... not to mention therapists don't take sides at all ideally).

I just don't know what to do... any ideas internet? Oh God I'm asking the internet...

TL;DR = Every friend/family/hobby I have is a threat to our relationship and I need to remove it from my life if I care about our marriage.

EDIT:  Wow lots of feedback, thank you everyone.  I did read the ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and I think that hit a lot of nails right on the head for me.  Well, except the one about being in a monogamous relationship with my mother.  My mom and I get along fine but we aren't super close by any means.  In fact, I've been making her cry almost constantly for the last couple years because I'm listening to my wife and ignoring my mom.  But I do put my wife on a pedestal and believe that I'll be happy if I make her happy.

I do habitually lie about things I'm ashamed of, mostly whenever I'm depressed I eat too much and then lie about it.  She caught me a few times and said that's how I cheat on her and if I lie about that I'll lie about other things.  So I guess I can kind of understand that but she didn't trust me LONG before any of that.  I think if I take control of my eating and workout habits a lot will improve.  Focusing on things *I* want will definitely be a refreshing change.  

We're going to Retrouvaille this weekend so we'll see if anything comes of that.  I do have an exit strategy planned if I decide to leave her.  I replied to someone in a comment that at one point I did tell her that I didn't love her anymore and was ready to discuss the terms of our separation.

842,,Non-Romantic,4t0r8j,1708,"Hi Relationships,

Last year a group of four girl friends [20sF] and I started a tradition of renting out a particular cottage during the summer for a weekend getaway with each other. This usually consists of us being unreasonably drunk/loud all day and night and something we look forward to all year. 

Six months ago when I began planning for this year's stay, we made sure to plan early so we could give Ella [25F] a lot of time to figure out what she can do with Lily [2F] in terms of babysitters. However, Ella said straight off the bat that her attending is unlikely. We were bummed but we understood. 

The cottage vacation is now a couple weeks away and Ella informed some of us yesterday that she will be attending and she is bringing Lily. Umm what?

Lily is an AMAZING girl and I'm always happy being in her company. But this is our vacation! So we can get drunk and swear and not worry about anything! Like any toddler, she requires a lot of attention to keep her occupied. Which I am always happy to do, but not during this trip.

First of all, the cottage is tiny, and I myself will be sleeping on a couch. Ella informed us that her and Lily will be tenting outside, but if it rains...I'm assuming she will feel like she will have to bring her toddler in, thus stopping the festivities so Lily can sleep. Another girl was also planning on bringing her dog, but since Lily is coming, she doesn't want to have to be watching their interactions all weekend and is now making other plans for the dog. Third of all, this cottage is on water, so I'm sure that we all will have to be doing some babysitting at some point during the trip to make sure she stays safe. Lastly, I don't expect Ella to put any money towards the cottage since she is tenting, but she will be using the facilities and I'm the one in charge of the safety deposit...the entire thing just seems like a big request to me. 

Two girls that are closest to her tried to explain to her yesterday that they love having Lily around, but this wasn't the most appropriate setting for her to be in. From what I was told, Ella got defensive and still insisted she wanted Lily to come.

How do we let her down easy, Relationships? She and her daughter are wonderful human beings, but she just doesn't seem to understand it's a lot to ask of us. It's a very sensitive subject so I'd like to be as courteous and understanding as possible.

I want to thank everyone for the helpful advice. It is very clear to me I was being intentionally obtuse about the situation. The truth is, hanging by the pool everyday while my daughter played was such a good situation that I wanted to avoid reality because it was easier for me. I decided to tell my wife what was going on and avoid going back to the group. 

First Marsha texted me Monday and asked me when I was coming over. I told her we weren't going to come because ""your behavior has made me very uncomfortable and it is not a good situation for me or my daughter."" She said ""wtf are you talking about?"" I said ""I'm not going to play this game, you know what I am talking about."" Then she said ""I will be more discreet."" I responded ""I am not interested in any kind of sexual or flirtatious relationship, we won't be hanging out with the group anymore."" She said ""lol do you have your period haha?"" I blocked her number. 

My in laws took my daughter to the beach so I sat my wife down and told her everything and showed her the texts. Initially, she didn't handle it well at all. She was very angry and directed it at me. She accused me of liking the attention and ""being a flirt"". This is something we have argued about before and honestly I am not overly flirtatious in any way that would be considered inappropriate. She has talked about this with her therapist and the therapist even told her that she is too sensitive about it and my behavior is normal. I told her I am friendly and I sometimes do flirt (it's just my nature) but I never have crossed any lines and never would. This isn't my fault and I just wanted to make her aware of why I was going to be avoiding Marsha and the group in the future. 

We kept talking and she kept trying to push some blame onto me and said I like making her jealous. We have this rule in our relationship where we can say a certain word and the other person has to give a completely honest answer with no bull shit or posturing. So I invoked the word and said ""Do you really think I did anything wrong or did any of this to hurt you or make you jealous?"" She stopped in her tracks and thought for a second and calmed down. She apologized and said she knows I didn't do anything wrong, she was just angry. She asked me what I was going to do about it. My wife thought I should tell her husband now but honestly Marsha feeds on drama and gossip and I just want to cut ties with her. She likes to think of herself as being on a reality show (she always talks about how she would be perfect for real housewives but her husband won't let her do it). Telling her husband might be a ""bro"" thing to do but furthering this drama and creating a war with Marsha is not good for my family living in this neighborhood. Also its not like her husband doesn't know what she is like. My hope is Marsha will just leave it be until the next dramatic plot in her fictional show grabs her attention.

My wife saw her therapist today and called me after and apologized for her behavior and reiterated that she felt I did nothing wrong. 

I don't really know what to tell my daughter. My wife's therapist told her that we should tell my daughter ""in an age appropriate way"" that Marsha was rude to me so we aren't going to play there anymore. I don't think that is the best approach. It would lead to more questions/confusion and I don't even want to have to tell my daughter that Marsha is mean or rude. Especially because I don't know what will happen in the future between our kids. It is possible they will interact/be friends down the line. 

Today I took her to an animal shelter to look for a dog to adopt (we had been planning this anyway.) So she was super focused on that and didn't even think about the playgroup. My plan now is to just set up playdates with some of the other kids without Marsha and plan activities for a while and eventually it will just become normal not to see them everyday.

Does anyone have any opinions on this part? 

I will update again if anything happens with Marsha. It is definitely possible she does something crazy which would be entertaining for you guys but my hope is she just leaves it alone.

We have the same tastes in movies, some in music, and both have an unhealthy obsession in bowling(never thought I'd find a partner as into as I am). We got engaged in September, and everything was going great.

About two weeks ago I got a series of pictures and a video from an unknown numbers. I saw it was her ex who was a manipulative, emotionally abusive person, who hurt Adrianna before she finally left. He stalked her for a year after.

The texts that went with it stated that she was his and I would never be able to please her. Truthfully, the guy's ego was much bigger than his prowess. It also didn't have the desired affect, because I didn't decide to cancel the wedding and never see her again. I am mainly pissed that he released very private pictures of her to someone he doesn't know. I also wonder who else he has sent them too. I've had nudes and had sex pics with a previous girlfriend, but when the relationship ended, I deleted them all(Isn't that what you are supposed to do, just out of courtesy?).

Just so she wouldn't get blind sided, I told Adriana. She has not taken it well. Her first fear was that I would leave. I have told her that I want to spend my life with her, this  doesn't change how I view her. She has repeatedly told me I am the best she has had, that her ex doesn't compare. I have told her this isn't a contest, I don't care what they had, just that she is happy with me now.

845,notjustauterus,Updates,3qeqbs,1704,"It has been four months since I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38nozk/i27f_feel_like_i_am_getting_pregnant_because_it/), I am not sure anyone would remember it. Boy has a lot happened. If you don't want to read the whole thing here is the short of it: I didn't go through with the in vitro. I went off the drugs and feel a lot better. My husband left me, I felt a lot worse. I left the state and started going to a therapist and four months later I feel optimistic about the future.



Within hours of posting, I went to my husband and told him I didn't think that i could go through with the procedure. He was confused, but I told him all about my thoughts of self harm and doubt about having children. I showed him the post I made and had a good cry. He was supportive and apologized, he said he remembered times i had hinted at things like this but he had brushed it off as hormones. He said we would get me into therapy. I asked him what this would mean for our marriage and he said, ""we will probably get divorced."" I was pretty floored, and you should have seen me try and take it all back- but it was out there.



Over the next week, he talked more and more about divorce and became incredibly cold. I would cry and cry and he would just ignore me. I begged him to go to therapy and he was usually pretty non-committal about it. After a couple of weeks, word got around to my family who suggested I leave him. I wanted to stay and try and work on things, he agreed with my family that I should leave. I went and stayed with my brother who lived nearby, but I was at our house every day,and we sort of just kept acting like nothing was wrong. We'd cuddle, watch TV, have sex, but then I would go away at night. My other brother called me up and told me I could stay with him on the other side of the country, but I wanted to stay because I thought my husband would come around. He didn't, and he told me it would be best if i left the state. I was hesitant, but around this time my husband was refusing the idea of going to therapy. He said he would go with me, but it wouldn't change his mind. I wish I could say I handled this all gracefully, but I spent most of my time sobbing, buying him expensive presents, and trying to convince him that we could make it work. He became more cruel and distant. We filed for divorce and I moved to the opposite coast to live with my other brother and his family. I moved, partially because I thought if my husband missed me he would change his mind.



I continued to be in a lot of denial. I wouldn't tolerate anybody in my family saying anything unkind about my husband and insisted that he would come around. They were all outraged that he left me only months after the miscarriage of our son while I was obviously having a breakdown. My husband tried to maintain a very friendly relationship once I left and I gobbled it up. We texted frequently, played online games together, and I thought perhaps things were getting better. I started frantically pitching ideas for how we could work. Things I would give up, sacrifices I would make, plans for how we could have it all. He wasn't interested. Even though many of my ideas were reasonable and realistic, he just kept saying that he didn't believe we could realistically have kids. By the end of July I could have filled notebooks with my schemes on how we could work out, but then I sort of starting becoming a little bit more angry. I couldn't understand why I was willing to fight, and compromise, and give things up to make things work but he wasn't even open to considering them.  I asked to go no contact and finally started seeing a therapist.



Things still are pretty hard, but they are getting better. I still think about and miss my husband every day, and the no contact thing didn't really stick. I have never felt anything as awful as knowing that he doesn't want me anymore. That being said, as devastating as it is, I don't have any more thoughts of hurting myself. I've also been able to work on figuring out what I want in life. I'm re-enrolled in school for this April to get another bachelors degree, but that is really only backup for some masters programs I am applying to. 



As for having babies, one thing I have realized now that I am further removed from the trauma of my son's  birth, is that I still do want to have children. I don't think my stress was so much caused by the thought of having kids as it was the fear I had of dying. I have always been worried about death by child birth, and several things this year made that feel more like a reality for me. My first step is to get healthy, physically and mentally. When I am down to a normal weight (I got pretty fat, it could take a while) and when I am emotionally ready i would be open to trying to having kids again. If I am never ready emotionally for pregnancy, I am all about adoption. 



It destroys me that this won't be with my husband. He has told me several times in the last few months that his goal is to have kids and that he would give up anything to have a family- including me. I've spent a lot of time being mad that he would do this to me when I need him so much. I'm mad he couldn't wait ant try and work this out together through therapy,  but he can't wait and I know I need to do this at my own pace. He also admitted that if I could never successfully have kids he would probably leave anyway, so I suppose it is better that we go our different ways now- I don't think I could handle the pressure of that ultimatum.



I am confident that one day I will find a man who will have similar goals and not be in too much of a rush to have children and can be enthusiastic about the idea of adoption. Maybe even someone open to being a stay at home dad while I work! Who knows, I am feeling optimistic. I'm down 20lbs, I can get through most days without crying, I'm going to Europe for Christmas, starting school in April, and finalizing my divorce tomorrow. Thanks for the help, reddit. As much as this all hurts, it is better than spending all day thinking about hurting myself feeling like a crazy person. Any further advice anyone has about coping with divorce would be greatly appreciated. 



tl;dr I didn't go through with the in vitro. Husband was unwilling to take the time to work stuff out together in therapy and left me. I moved across the country and starting seeing a therapist. I'm working on getting my life together, getting better, and moving on. Any advice on getting over a divorce you never wanted?

846,Agnatic,Relationships,8boqxe,1697,"I met Sarah 7 years ago. She was friends with my older sister, and they would hang out at our house. We became best friends in her last year of high school. I was 15, and she was 18. She went off to university, and our friendship transitioned to an online one. She goes to a university that's 50 minutes away, so we can only meet each other once a month, but I talk to her every day online, and I have her added on all my social media.

She was acting strange yesterday. I asked her if anything was wrong. She said there was something that she'd been wanting to say for a long time. Sarah admitted that she was in love with me, and said she'd been thinking about me in this way for the past year. She told me how jealous she was getting - seeing me talk to other girls online. I asked her to further explain her feelings towards me. She said I made her feel special; even with our age difference, and distance we could make a serious relationship work. She told me that university life made her feel lonely, and the best part of her day was talking to me.

I told Sarah I loved her too, but that I'm too young for her. I said she should be dating someone closer to her age, but she said it was okay because I'm mature enough to date her.

When she asked for a relationship I told her I wasn't sure, and she started crying. She asked me why we couldn't be together if we love each other, and left the call before I could give her my reasons. Later that day, at night, she sent me a bunch of drunk texts and videos of her crying again, saying how much she loves me, how great of a girlfriend she'd be, and how the only reason she wakes up in the morning is because of me.

Our friendship is extremely strained at the moment too. This morning she texted me a lot of hearts and a paragraph on how much she loves/cares about me, but she took it back later in the afternoon. Sarah was freaking out, and begged me not to cut her out of her life because I'm the only person she can talk to. She seemed extremely paranoid that I was going to end the friendship, until I promised her I wasn't.

I am so fucking stressed, and the whole situation has been eating at me. I want a relationship with her, but it's not a good idea, because no matter how much we love each other I don't think it'll work because of our age difference, the distance between us, and the mental health issues that I think she has. 

I don't think Sarah can handle a relationship. I'm concerned that her only reason for waking up in the morning is me, and the fact that her reaction was to drink alcohol to my answer. I need advice on what to do. I can't ghost her, she's my best friend, and I want to help but I have no clue what to do or where to start. I'm scared of losing my best friend.

I'm not close with my sister, but I might be able to get her to talk to Sarah because they're still friends. Or I could have my parents talk to her parents because they're friends with each other, but I feel like her life is spiraling out of control, she's pushing everyone away from her, and I'm the only person that can stop it. 

Please help me.

847,,Non-Romantic,6ewbpm,1698,"So I have been friends with married couple Kelly and Liam since we were all at university together. I knew Kelly first and became friends with Liam once they started dating. We have been friends for a while, but never each other's ""best friends"".

A few years ago I moved into an apartment complex with a really great pool. I used to invite them over a lot because we used to hang out all the time. A lot of times when I would invite them, they would take it upon themselves to invite another couple as well. So I would be fifth-wheeling at my own pool basically. I let all that slide because I felt we were so close so it didn't matter. Cut to now and I only see them at best once a month for a happy hour or something. Sure, that type of thing happens, but this is what brings me to the point of the post.

About 1.5 months ago, we were at said happy hour and Liam straight up told me he was planning on using my pool basically whenever he sees fit. I didn't really know what to say so I kind of brushed it off. But, not a few weeks later I see him there with one of his friends. I kind of got a little cheesed off at that point because I am the one paying to use that pool, and since they seem to have a penchant for inviting their couple friends, I feel that I can expect the same to happen. And since we are not close like we were several years ago, I am not comfortable with them coming over on their own accord without an invitation.

Now, I do not live in a gated area, but according to management we are supposed to have pool cards on our person at the pool. Nobody abides by this, but management knows me and they seem to be friendly with many of the tenants so they pretty much know who lives there and don't really ask for ID. Basically, I would like to know how to nip this in the bud before it goes too far. I know there will be times I am going to be at the pool on my own and they will show up with their gaggle of friends (who they have excluded me from since after college...a main reason I do not want to see them so much). I know it will be an awkward situation. My two schools of thought on this are: I make it as awkward as possible for them when they do show up, or I inform management when I feel they have been taking advantage.

Once again, this is mostly preemptive, but they have done this before and now that we aren't close, I think it's disrespectful of them. Maybe I'm wrong, but I pay to live at this place and they are just using me for the awesome pool. I know it and surely they must too.

I know all of you guys would be expecting a wonderful update with all of us becoming one big happy family.

Sorry, but I got bitch slapped by life.

Since a couple of weeks ago, she kept pushing me again and again over visiting my son. I told her ""No"" firmly, but she kept on being passive aggressive. All I wanted was a little more time, but she pushed me to a limit. She said that my son was missing her (he was not) and that I'm doing him a disservice by keeping her out of his life, and that I'm a horrible parent and I can't raise my son alone. We had a big fight over it, and we broke up.

She broke down and crawled back and apologised but things were never going to be the same.

It's been about a month since I broke up with my ex, and I'm doing better than ever now. 

I've seen my ex once since the last time I updated. Last week, she showed up outside my friend's house and begged to talk to me. I guess I finally felt ready to face her, so I agreed to speak to her. She told me that she'd made a huge mistake, that she needed me in her life, and she was extremely sorry for not being there for me, etc etc. I let her talk and cry and beg, and when she was done, I told her that if she wanted me to stay, she shouldn't have told me these things after she already accused me of cheating, slandered me on facebook, and supported a rapist over me. I told her that I knew she'd find someone that loved her and that she loved, but I couldn't be that person for her anymore. She got bitchy and told me that I couldn't just leave her like that. I couldn't just leave her to live on her own and become homeless because I know she can't pay for the full rent and the bills with how much she makes. She accused me of being heartless and abandoning her. I told her that if she didn't want me to abandon her, she shouldn't have abandoned me when I needed her most. 

That was the last time I spoke to her, and honestly, getting that last little bit of talk with her just proved to me that I made the right decision. Thinking back on our relationship, she's always been selfish. She never really cared about how I felt, only about how she felt. In a way, this last meeting just cemented to me that I dodged a bullet. It may have taken me three years to dodge that bullet, but at least I learned it now instead of later.

As for the woman who raped me.. She'll never come to justice. I've come to terms with that. I've talked to a lawyer and gotten legal advice just in case she tries to make an accusation against me. I made a good choice by filing that police report, and while they didn't find enough evidence to press charges, I've at least left a paper trail.  At this point, it's been almost a month since she told my girlfriend that I raped her, and I haven't heard anything. I don't think that at this point she'd say anything, but I'm staying cautious just in case. I'm just going to still hope that she has some human decency and doesn't try to press charges, but at least I know what to do if that happens.

So now that everything has settled down, I'm ready to start a new life somewhere else. I think after three years of being with the same person, that I could use an adventure. I've gotten a job opportunity out of state, and I'm going to go for it. It's in a huge city states away, but I'm going to move and start completely new out there. This weekend I'm flying out there to look at some apartments and get to know the city a little better. I'll miss my friends, but I can always come visit them.

These last few weeks, I've been pretty happy. I feel like a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders. My therapist has helped a lot in helping me to heal from what happened and move on and learn to trust again. I see him once a week, and will continue seeing him up until the point that I move. After that, I'll find a new therapist in my new city. All my friends, especially the friend I'm living with, have been awesome and incredibly supportive. I've been going to the gym 5 days a week, putting way too many hours into Skyrim, going out with my friends, meeting new people, etc etc. I've basically been keeping myself busy. There are still some days that I feel depressed or sad or incredibly angry, but they're getting less and less frequent. At least, I don't feel that way the majority of days anymore. I know it'll probably randomly come up in my head every once in a while, but I think I'll be able to work past it.

Overall, things have been going well. I've had a lot of positive pieces fall into place, and I'm ready to put this whole thing behind me and move forward. Strangely enough, this whole ordeal may be exactly what I needed to move my life in the direction that it needed to go.

This will likely be my last update. Thank you, reddit, for helping me out throughout this process. Seriously, I appreciate all the advice I got. I don't think I would have made it through that as well as I did if it wasn't for you guys. 

TL;DR: I've realized that I dodged a bullet with my ex. Now I'm going off to a new city to start a new life with a new job and meet new people. Thank you Reddit!

852,whysisterwhy,Non-Romantic,52ltdy,1697,"So, my big sister and I have always got along remarkably well. Aside from the dumb squabbles as kids, we have never had a real argument in the whole twenty six years I've known her...until now. 


My sis and her husband recently announced they're expecting! It was great, they invited the whole family over for dinner and told everyone. She's *just* starting to show, which explains why she's been wearing baggy sweaters in 80 degree heat lol. Anyway, this was a couple weeks ago and everything's been fine. I even went with her to look at gender neutral items and stuff and it was delightful...and then about a week ago she sat me down over lunch on my day off from work and very brazenly said, ""you need to get pregnant so our kids can grow up together."" ...wait, what?! 


At first I thought she was kidding, but from her stony face and body language I quickly became aware that she was as serious as could be. I asked what the hell she was talking about and she explained that if I wait too much longer to have a child, our kids won't be close enough in age to have a good relationship and they won't he able to grow up together and be best friends. 


I do have a boyfriend, but we've only been dating for seven months and in my personal opinion that's *way* too long to he thinking about marriage and children, but my sister doesn't think so. I said that I wasn't going to get pregnant just so our kids can have an aesthetically pleasing relationship and it developed into an argument, where I left angry. 


We just talked again for the first time two days ago. It was my aunts birthday party so a bunch of our family was there and my sis kept making passive aggressive comments about me and how I'm not supporting her and stuff. My mom came up to me and apparently agrees with my sister! She said ""you don't know how much longer I have left, I expect grandkids and they need to have each other if something happens to you or Sister."" My mom's in her 60s and healthy as far as I know, and both my sister and I are healthy. 


I don't get what their problem is. I don't know if my boyfriend is the one. It'll be years before I'm in a place where I'd be able to support a child. I usually talk to my sister every day and now we're avoiding each other and things are tense with my mother, who will surely bamboozle my dad into agreeing with her. It looks like if I don't have a baby to appease them my family will be divided.

We posted here a week or so ago about the problems we were having with our parents, and things kinda have been resolved some since then, so I thought I'd update. The same day that we posted the topic we went over to our dad's house. After a lot of stalling and such we never did end up asking him about it on that day since he was extremely happy and we didn't want to ruin that. So we waited, and when we saw him again on Thursday, my sister just let it all out then.

He didn't automatically say anything at first, then he asked us how we felt. My sister told him how she was feeling, and I did as well, and then he just got up and went to make a call after that. He didn't mention anything else about it until later on that day when he took us home, and that's when our mother came out. Usually she just stays inside and we let ourselves in, and I'm pretty sure this is the first time in years they've been close to each other.

We could instantly feel the tension between them, but despite this dad still kept a cool head. All he said was, ""I would appreciate it if you wouldn't discuss those things in that way in front of our children"". There was a little back and forth between them, basically with our mother telling him to screw off, she can talk about what she wants and whatever. Then our dad left, and when we went inside all hell broke lose.

She went off on my sis for being ""nosy"" and ""intruding"" on her adult conversation, and told her to keep her mouth shut about anything she says about dad because then he'll start telling us things that aren't true. My sis was not having it that night and they yelled at each other for at least an hour. It got so bad I had to literally drag her away into her room, but unfortunately our mom followed us in there. Then that's when she said something that I think pretty much gave us our answer, ""...and so what if I wanted to keep my needs met, you'd turn out to do the same slutty thing if you aren't satisfied, so f**k off"". She rambled for a minute about human needs and sexuality and then slammed the door.

The next morning she tried to act like nothing had happened and tried to talk, but neither of us really responded. Later on that day we had to sneak over to dads as she forbid us to go. We asked him a straightfoward question which we said he didn't have to tell us if he thought it wasn't our business.

* How did you find out mom was cheating?
**Answer**: She had brought someone home apparently on the day that my sister and I were at school, and he could literally hear them having sex in the house. Afterwards she just came in his room and flat out told him she wanted a divorce, that she couldn't do this sick thing anymore. And the thing that really struck both me and my sister is that apparently after he was better and back to normal, she asked him to get back together, and he said no. I guess that may be a reason as to why she still has something against him. 

We've discovered so much and its still a lot to take in. My sister is more on the emotional side so it effects her a little more, but just like a lot of other things I know that we'll get over the hurt we feel over this eventually-however long that'll be. For our dad mostly, but also because our mother has done so much emotional damage throughout our lives (not counting this, but it does take the cake for our decision), that we're trying to decide if we even want to continue talking to her when we are older. Right now we've been staying with our dad, and we'll probably be here for awhile. 

To end this on maybe a little happier note our father did tell us that he has been with a women for a little over a year now, and he's thinking about introducing us soon.

Monday (spit happened, Saturday, first post Sunday).
Questions answered from my inbox:

**No weird voodoo stuff** - we are both pretty white-bread Canadians. She is from east coast, Im from west coast.

**I'd be shocked if it was some fetish** - but honestly I'd prefer that to latent anger.

**Why didnt I confront her that night?** I was shocked. I know people can interpret the same actions in different ways - and my interpretation to her spitting in my water was ""this is an act of anger on her part, and the hidden element of it, made it more I dont know ??sinister??. So that was how I interpreted it... hence my shock and well just confusion (and not knowing exactly what to say).

**Her parents both died in car accident when she was in undergrad. Tragic. Dad either had a heart attack while driving with Mom, or had the heart attack when accident was happening :-(

**She has two older siblings. One she does not speak with, other is just kind of a different guy and we don't see him much due to that (off-grid type of guy, kind of lone wolf type), not due to any family issues between them.

**No, we don't have a dog. She is not super fond of dogs, and thought it would be easier during the kids < 5 years stage not to also have a dog. She has agreed to revisit the idea of getting another dog when the kids are older, in ~ 4-5 years.

==

I decided to talk to her last (Sunday) night. I thought it would be a good idea to wait until we were in bed (I know, not normally a good time to talk)... because I could then take a look at my water and see if there was anything in it. So we went to bed like normal and I made an excuse I needed to stay downstairs for a bit (to give her time to spit in my water again if she was going to). I came up and then brought my water into my bathroom (we have an ensuite and a main bathroom -- I use the ensuite). I looked carefully in it - but didn't see any spit.

So we get into bed and I say I want to talk. I said point blank... ""Last night when I was coming up to bed I saw you spit into my water, and I want to know why you would do something like that?""

She sat upright in the bed quite fast. In a tone that I thought was maybe too forceful she said ""Are you accusing me of spitting in your water?"" (or something to that effect).

I stressed that I ""SAW"" her spit, and that there is no accusation - its a fact. She got pretty mad pretty quick. ""Why would I do that"" (she said). ""That is why I am asking you"" (I said). Back and forth a few times. Well she just got up out of bed and went downstairs (after maybe 3-5 minutes of talking). Normally we dont bolt if we are arguing (though we rarely argue). I thought she was just going downstairs to cool off, but I heard the garage door open and sure enough she took the car out for a drive.

I called my friend who knows both of us from grad school (though he is primarily my friend). Told him the situation. He said he would be surprised if she did that but didnt put it out of the realm of possibilities with her. REALLY I asked him. He said she has mean streak, and we all know she is stubborn. ""She did kill your dog"" he says (1/2 joking)... which is an interesting way to phrase it (everyone knows it was an accident and she felt HORRIBLE about it) When we first moved in, I had my old dog with me (dog is deaf), and unfortunately one day she was backing out of the garage and the dog was lying on the driveway... :-((( That was 2-3 months after we moved in. (I am hesitant to even include that because I know some will latch onto that as proof she is a smoldering master psycho that has deceived me for 5 years.... sigh). I was more shocked that my friend thought she was capable of spitting into my water.

Anyways, she eventually comes home, Im still up/cant sleep. She starts asking me why in hell she would spit in my drink, how could I think she would do something like that, and basically turns it onto me as why I would accuse her of something that is so gross and mean spirited. I stuck to my guns and said its her that has to explain it - cause I saw it. It went back and forth for about 10 minutes, then I picked up my pillow and said I'll sleep in the spare room until she is ready to really talk about what happened.

So this morning, it was a 'cold war' style morning. We did all the kids stuff - but only spoke to each other when necessary.
Im at work now, and well just wondering what the fuck.

====
**Wednesday's Update**

Well I am still sleeping in the spare room and the cold war continues.

Last night we spoke again after kids went to bed. It went something like this ... all conversations have gone something like this...


Me: I need you to tell me why you did that.

Her: I am disgusted you would even think I would do that, and now you have taken it to the level of sleeping in the other room. I am offended/pissed/hurt too, that you don't trust my word that I've said I didn't do it, and you still keep on insisting you saw it. Why don't you believe me?

Me: I did see it, please just come clean and lets put this behind us.


====
So we are now at this stand still.
We have planned to take kids to water park this weekend (stay over in hotel there). She 'wants an apology' or she/we are not going. **Totally unfair to the kids**, but honestly I don't want to be in a hotel room with her for 2 nights.

I was a little dumbfounded why 'she wants an apology'... but she explained it like this.

1. I have accused her of a disgusting act (insult to her).
2. I have not trusted her word that she said she did not do it (insult to her).
3. I have escalated it to sleeping in the other bedroom (insult to her).

She said ""lets switch it around"" and say I told you I saw you 'shitting in my food' (to make it more disgusting). And you said you didnt do it, and that I (wife) insisted it happened and now she is sleeping in the other room until I admit I did it.

I am torn. I mean I see her point that it would be hurtful not to trust your partners word - but I swear 100% I plainly saw (and heard it)... so what the fuck do I do? I've read the gas lighting thing -- and I can see how you start to question 'did I really see it? Maybe she was clearing her throat and I just got some weird light/reflection off the top of the water)?

So what do I do. Just bite my pride, say I am mistaken and keep my eyes peeled for anything else? Get proof (visual) if it happens again so she cannot deny it so strongly?

Thoughts please....

===

TL:DR: Im the crazy/insulting one, and I should apologize. Kids suffering.

856,Enort,Infidelity,2nsy91,1698,"I'm really freaking out right now because if what I suspect is true, this living situation is about to get really complicated. Please tell me I'm just crazy. Sorry if this is long.


**Background**

We are two couples living together, we all attend the same university. The apartment was originally leased by my girlfriend of about 2 years (Alexis) [22F] and our mutual friend Brooke [22F]. The apartment is huge and expensive. There was originally supposed to be 3 girls living there but the last one backed out abruptly. They were planning on moving somewhere cheaper, but they had put a lot of work into the apartment and loved it so much they hated the idea of leaving. I offered to move in when my lease was up in May so we could split the rent and utilities 3 ways. I was sleeping over often anyways. Both girls were absolutely ecstatic about the idea. Shortly before I moved in Brooke started dating my best friend Derek.  This was cool because now both couples got to hang out with their best friends and SOs all at once. It seemed perfect. Derek began sleeping over a lot and when his parents sold their house and left in October, he temporarily moved in. We haven't really pushed for him to find a new place because splitting everything four ways is helping all of us so much. But again, only Alexis and Brooke are on the lease. The apartment owner surprisingly does not mind as long as rent gets paid, because we are always quiet.

There are three incidents that made me think something was up. If it weren't for these combined incidents, I would never make an accusation like this because Alexis is such a sweet and shy girl and Derek has been a brother to me.  They don't seem flirty, but as I mentioned before all four of us are very close friends so we spend a lot of time together.


**Incident 1**

MWF Brooke and I have early classes, so we're gone by 8am.  Derek and Alexis start in the afternoon so it's not unusual for them to leave together, though they usually take separate cars. One of these days, I decided to wait for Alexis outside of her class so I could surprise her with lunch. I watched everyone shuffle out of the class, but Alexis wasn't with them.  I texted her asking where she was and she replied *""Just got out of class, gonna go home to study""* I called her to see if I had just barely missed her or something and there was no response, which I considered weird because she had just texted me second ago. She didn't answer until much later, which is also unusual for her (she's one of those girls that's often on her phone).  I ran into Brooke later in the day and she mentioned in passing that Derek had stayed home sick, she was going to bring him soup, blah blah. At the time, I didn't think much of it.

When I got home later that night I noticed Alexis' car was in the exact same spot. (She usually parks in guest parking because our unit only has 3 spaces, as a result her car moves a lot). I asked her if she'd gone to class and she got quiet before sheepishly admitting to skipping because she felt the professor sucked at explaining things, but she knows I hate when she skips classes (something that's gotten her grades in trouble before, but she recently started doing better). I kissed her and said I trusted her judgment. While I was doing the dishes she explained how she probably won't skip again because being bored alone in the house was the worst. I laughed and we went about our business. At night we went to bed and as I laid there drifting off, it hit me. She shouldn't have been alone because Derek was home sick - right? She was still up on her phone so I popped awake and asked her where Derek was today since Brooke had said he was home sick. She seemed startled by the question, but that may have been from me being half asleep to suddenly wide awake with a random question. She said he was here a bit in the morning but went to do errands or something, she wasn't sure. After the other incidents, I realized that the scattered way she answered this question seemed off, but that may just be my imagination.


**Incident 2**

I went to throw some stuff out in the kitchen garbage when I noticed a condom wrapper that was the exact same brand Alexis and I use. It wasn't super visible, sort of tucked behind a cereal box but the distinctive color caught my eye. Brooke and Derek always use a different brand (free from the university health center while ours are expensive Trojans). It was weird because we usually keep the wrappers in our respective room's garbage cans so they never appear in the kitchen. Furthermore, because of exams and general stress Alexis and I hadn't slept together in a few days. I didn't really dig around for a used condom or anything, I just went back to the room to check if any of ours were missing. I really couldn't tell, because we buy in bulk. My first thought was that Brooke and Derek had ran out and broke into our stash and I was upset that they hadn't even asked. Later that night I mentioned the condom wrapper to Alexis and her eyes got wide.  When I mentioned my theory she got unusually distressed (she's always very calm) and went on a rant about them violating our privacy. I suggested we talk to them about it and she immediately shut the idea down and made me swear not to bring it up unless they did it again. She didn't want to have this awkward conversation, which was weird to me because we're all generally pretty open about sex given that we live together. Though it is possible that Alexis was being genuine because she's from a conservative small town and she doesn't talk about these things as much as we do. 


**Incident 3**

Me and Derek are cool with the dudes in the apartment next to us, who are graduates from our university. We don't hang out or anything, but we have the kind of relationship where we make small talk about sports or whatever in the hall and are comfortable asking the other to keep it down without it being awkward. Last Monday (during our break) I was locking up when no one else was at the apartment, when I ran into one of the guys from next door. We talked football for a bit and then he mentioned that one of the couples in the apartment is really a fan of morning sex and that the walls were way too thin. I laughed because Alexis and I usually had sex weekend mornings when we had the house to ourselves (Brooke and Derek usually spend weekends at her parents house about an hour and a half away). The more I thought about it later in the day, the more I realized we hadn't been having morning sex in about a month, on the weekends it had been more towards the evening or not at all.  Did he mean on weekdays?! My heart sort of dropped. I kind of want to ask him to elaborate but the conversation ended and I feel like I missed my chance. Plus its a weird thing to ask and I feel like I must be being paranoid.

So there you have it r/relationships. Am I crazy? Am I looking for signs that aren't there or is something up? And if so how do I proceed? I don't want to ask her just yet because 1) I don't want to come off as crazy and jealous if nothings up 2) If something is up, I don't want them to start hiding it better. I was thinking of dropping by one of those mornings they're alone together but I don't know how to time it right. If I drop by too early or late they might get more cautious.

857,flakysuitor,Updates,3z6yz1,1697,"I decided to write an update since the holiday season is coming to a close. So I got a sound thrashing in the comment section of my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vfsuf/my_25_f_love_interest_turned_down_second_date/). I deserved it though. Rereading it, I cringe at the fact that I asked if people thought she was crazy.


In retrospect, I think I knew I fucked up big-time but I didn't want to admit it to myself. I was hoping for validation and did not get it. I wanted to walk away scotch-free without having to do any reflection. But ya'll didn't let me do that.


A few days after the post, I reached out to Renae (love interest) and told her I wanted to grab a drink and talk about what happened. To my amazement, she agreed to come. (Later, I found out that she just didn't want things to be awkward with the group but still, she came!)


I apologized and explained a lot of the background of my previous relationship and how hard the break up was on me. Turns out, she already knew about that from our friend group. I told her I didn't want to rush things but that I liked her a lot and I was being immature. She pushed during the conversation for me to verbalize why I put off talking to her. Basically, I think it came down to a fear of being hurt and wanting to maintain some semblance of control. She's amazing and I knew that I would probably end up falling hard for her but I was scared to get gutted again, like in my last relationship. I thought if I only saw her every two weeks, I would fall slower and things would be okay.


So, Renae agreed to go out with me again! We've been on six  dates in the last month and every time one is ending I ask her when I can see her again. She teases me a lot about it, which I deserve. I'm really, really happy. I can feel my heart flip when she makes eye contact and smiles at me. She makes me laugh so hard and I'm amazed by how hard of a worker she is. She's exceptionally kind (volunteers at a soup kitchen twice a week) and donates a good amount of her salary to a homeless shelter. I could listen to her tell stories for hours and I find myself thinking about her constantly during the day. Basically, she's amazing and I almost lost her because I'm a moron. I've started planning how I'm going to ask her to be my girlfriend (do adults do that or is that a high school thing?).

He [25m] contacted me[25f] on facebook a little over a year ago trying to figure out how we knew each other (had 12 mutual friends) and ended up hitting it off.? After a bit we started dating and about a month later he asked me how I was related to Annie [24f] since we had the same last name.? I explaned she was my sister and he got a worried look and told me that he and Annie had sort of ""unofficially dated"" about 5 years prior.? They hung out a few times with friends and a few times alone and that they never made girlfriend/boyfriend status and later drifted apart when my sister found a more attractive guy.

A bit of info on my sister.? My sister hasn't been single for more than a week since middle school.? She NEEDS to be with a guy to feel like she matters and the more attractive/popular/rich the better.? She also has anxiety, depression/manic depression, PTSD, an eating disorder, ect which I know affects her self esteem and puts a strain on all her relationships, both with family and potential suitors.?With all this she tends to bounce from one guy to the next really fast. Her moods tend to be pretty wild and she has always been a cruel sister so while I do love her I keep my distance.

Normally I would never date my sisters ex but I called her up after realizing it and asked if it was okay to date (insert boyfriends name here) since they didnt really have a relationship and I really liked him.? It took her a while to remember who he even was and then said something along the lines of it was fine and that we would be a cute couple.

Fast forward a year and NOW she has decided to have a problem with it.? She told me that at the time she didn't think we would last and it would be over and done and never be brought up again so why complain?
My sister then brought the problem up to our mom expecting her to tell me to break up with my boyfriend.?  And our mom told her ""You've dated every guy in the tri county area, your sister would have to move out of state to find a decent guy you haven't screwed"".
My sister now refuses to acknowledge my relationship and boyfriend and will skip out on family activities if he is going to be there.

So here I sit, do I break up with my amazing boyfriend of a year so I can keep my relationship with my sister.? Or do I keep dating my boyfriend since she did have the chance to say no and is likely just trying to make my life difficult?

What do I do???

Ugh. Maybe its time to move into a city or something.
(Sorry for the long post; also written on moble)

An Edit for some clarity:  My mother has NEVER spoken to my sister in that manner before, thats why it came as such a shock to both my sister and I.  My parents always side with my sister because of her emotional unstableness and if its over something rediculous they always apologize to me after in private and try to smooth things over.  Even when my sister brought home 3 guys in one week my mom welcomed them into the home and included them like family.  Genetically my dads side of the family has mental health problems.  My sister does see a therapist. This doesnt stem from abuse in the home, literally EVERYONE in the family seems to have something (except one cousin that I can think of) and while I'm still free of any diagnosed problems Ill still likely get post partum depression after kids (no woman on my dads side in 3 generations has NOT had it).  And its not just a bit of anxiety its full on schizophrenia and incredibly rare and serious mental health problems.

When I say than I want to 'keep my relationship with my sister' what I mean is right now we can sort of get along and be amicable with each other. But with it just being my immediate family in the area when my sister tells my parents she wont come over for dinner they just cancel plans all together.  No point in just having one kid over, that happens all the time so why make a fuss and make a big dinner and pull out the board games?  Not appeasing my sister means no structured quality family time.  My parents having to spend time individually with each kid will have a toll on that part of our relationships too.

**EDIT** Thank you to everyone for such an outpouring of support, it means so much to me! My GF and I had a big talk last night and she is going to tell her parents. It's likely they will find out at some point anyway, and it isn't fair that my GF should feel uncomfortable with her own family. And to the people who are saying John must be gay, please think about what you're saying and how offensive it is. Yes, there have been instances where intensely homophobic people are hiding same-sex attraction. But they are in the minority. If I came to you saying my GF was black and her sister was marrying a KKK member, no one would be saying ""oh he just wants to be black"". Some people are just hateful. 


Hi guys, a few people hit me up for an update and I wanted to let you all know what ended up happening. Thanks for everyone?s support and advice, I wasn?t expecting so many people to comment and I really appreciate everyones feedback.  I?ve added some (fake) names here because there?s more people involved and I think it gets more confusing. 


From all the comments I got the sense that I was hugely overreacting. I?m an anxious person who can jump to the worst case scenario a lot of the times ? it?s something I?m really trying to work on because I don?t like that side of myself. That?s really why I came here, to get another opinion before talking to my girlfriend. And you all slapped some sense into me, so thank you for that. 


So my girlfriend came over that night, and I decided to follow people?s advice and just talk to her about it honestly and be completely upfront. I said, ?I wanted to surprise you by getting into Firefly so I went onto your hard drive to get it? and reddit my heart just broke, she was excited and wanted to put it right on so we could watch it together. I knew then that what I thought had happened didn?t ? she obviously didn?t make the connection with the folder being hidden in her Firefly folders and was just keen to watch the show with me. That little reaction just made me feel so relieved ? it?s hard to explain but I knew then that there was no way she was hiding this big secret and she obviously didn?t have any shame or embarrassment around the hidden folder, because she didn?t even remember that the folder was in there.


so I just said that I had accidently found the folder of her step sister (Lizzie), the one called ?ugh?. I asked why she had made it. Her face just fell and she was quiet for a bit. And then she told me this whole story:


So I had noticed my GF had been quiet and a bit sad recently, but she?s been working a lot and I just assumed she was super tired. But no, like a few of you guessed she had had a big fight with Lizzie. 


A few weeks ago a high school friend (Gina) of my GF got in contact with her on facebook. Gina is fairly religious and goes to church a lot. Gina said she didn?t want to make waves in my GFs family, but wanted to let her know ? the guy Lizzie is marrying (John) is well-known in the Christian community in our area for being involved in those gay-conversion workshops and seminars. Gina wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, and seemed to think maybe she had accepted John?s work out of some internalized homonegativity. 


My girlfriend (and I) did NOT know that John did stuff like that. I only knew that he was a therapist and that he went to church, and my girlfriend said he had only ever been introduced like that to her. She said she was pretty sure her parents didn?t know either, as they have always been loving and accepting of her and would be outraged over John?s line of work. She was worried that John had been lying to Lizzie as well, and contacted Lizzie to tell her what she had heard from Gina.


Obviously it didn?t go well. Lizzie was very defensive, and basically just kept telling my GF that John?s beliefs were his beliefs and Lizzie had no right to make any assumptions over it. It was clear Lizzie knew what John was doing and was completely find with it, and was hiding it through omission from her family.


My GF cried and cried through telling me this. As I said in my last post, Lizzie was such a hero to my GF and she loves her so much, so this acceptance is such a betrayal. I think that?s why she didn?t tell me when it first happened, and when she hid those files ? she just didn?t? want to have to deal with it, because Lizzie hurt her so much by not caring what John does for ?therapy?. These workshops focus on telling gay kids/adults of how wrong and perverted they are, and basically force them back into the closet. They focus on scaring parents into cutting support off from their gay children and use all these horrible horrible tactics to basically force these people to hide their sexuality. 


So she said she just couldn?t stand having all these reminders of Lizzie scattered through her computer, so she ended up just putting them all into one folder and hiding it. I guess ?ugh? meant ?ugh I don?t want to deal with this right now?. 


We?re sort of at a loss to do now. I?m obviously just trying to give my girlfriend as much support as I can, because everything is her decision now. Lizzie doesn?t seem willing to see that what her fianc? has dedicated his life to is so painful for her sister. My GF doesn?t know whether to tell her parents. On one hand, it?s going to be horrible/painful/awkward as balls to have family dinners with this future brother-in-law who thinks that her and me are ?defective?. And my GF is pretty sure both her parents (including her step-dad) would do what they can to protect her from John. On the other hand, she loves Lizzie so much and doesn?t want to force her away from her family. It?s not Lizzie?s profession, and John has never been outright nasty to my GF. 


So it?s still in motion, but I wanted to let you guys know what?s happened since my last post. I?m obviously relieved my GF doesn?t have feelings for Lizzie, but this is still heartbreaking in a different way. It?s horrible to see my GF so upset and I?m just trying to give her as much love and care as humanly possible. I?m excited for tonight because I borrowed a projector from my friend and am going to set it up so we can watch Firefly on the wall of my living room. I?m going to make us a big blanket fort and order pizza so we can snuggle and watch TV all night. 


Thank you all again, it means the world to me that you all took time out of your lives to offer advice to me.

More than anything, I just want to thank those who responded. You were so kind, thoughtful, and helpful. And right.

I felt so exposed and vulnerable that I forgot a few things: my husband has *never* done something he knew would hurt me. More importantly, when I am not ok, he isn?t either, even though it doesn?t show. 

I don?t have a family of my own that I can trust, and it sucks. He has parents that I?ve never had, and they?ve welcomed me with open arms, always. They could tell I wasn?t ok, and like you all pointed out, my husband turned to them. I *cannot* hold that against him.

I would have a huge problem if they asked me directly about my issues because it just **hurts** too much to talk about. I feel safest talking about it with my best friend and therapist. The in-laws have never mentioned it, and like you all said, his gets from them what I get from my BFF and therapist. So I say no harm, no foul. 


Again, thank you all for showing me the way back to reality when I couldn?t see it through my fear and all those other shitty feelings. You?ve spared my husband and me some grief.

**tl:Dr** I felt disregarded and betrayed, but turns out I was neither of those things. Reality is better than my inner world. Also, you guys rock. ",1515197312.0,UPDATE: [28F] overheard my FIL [70M] reveal that my husband [29M] told him something very private about me. I?m hurt.,0.96
863,spotthejerk12,Relationships,7r79gq,1683,"Son got into a very bad crowd as a teenager. Part of it was just the neighborhood we grew up in, it was a bad neighborhood, too much nightlife and drugs and partying, at age 15-16 he was basically already a street kid. At age 17, he joined a band, and at times we didn't see him for 2-3 days at a time. He was just a lost kid basically. He was very good looking, and I think that was part of his downfall at that age, his ego and his looks/charm made it so he went crazy partying and doing drugs with models at clubs and all that stuff. He got invited to parties that we would never have gone to at that age, he was a very, very popular guy. Then, one day, when he was 17, we found needles in his room, he was doing heroin. At first we tried to get him to go to rehab, and he went, and then right when he got back he did it again. We got into a massive, massive fight, he left, stealing nearly 500 bucks from us, and left to washington DC with his band. We were heartbroken. 

He tried to come back 2 months later, and my husband was so mad that he got into a fist fight with him, and my son never came back. 

I stayed in contact as much as I could. He would call me from random phones asking how everything was throughout the years, we met up a few times without my husband, sometimes he looked alright, sometimes he very clearly had relapsed. He never quit that band, and they seemed to be doing alright for themselves. 

Then, I just lost contact, for a really long time. He said he went to Los Angeles, then Sao Paulo, and that was all I knew for years. I have 2 other kids, and at the time... well he just wasn't present in my mind all the time. I hoped the best for him, but I had no idea what he was doing with his life at all, and I figured if he wanted to let me know he would. A year went by without any contact, then another... then 5 years went by. 
  
Up until 3 months ago. He called me, and I nearly broke out in tears. We talked for a very long time. He had been sober for 4 years he said. His band had gotten huge suddenly, and they were making a ton of money off of touring. He said when his tour was over, he planned to move back to nyc, and that he wanted to see us and reconnect with us. I thought he meant dinner or something, but no, he wanted to be a part of our life and everything. 

So fast forward 2 months later, and he sort of impromptu came to the apartment. He said hello to us, and my husband was really, really clearly upset at his visit. He gave me this stink eye the entire time, like I had betrayed his trust. My son looked GREAT. Holy shit did he look good, the dragged out face he used to have was gone, he clearly was working out a lot, he didn't look well... sketchy anymore. My husband didn't care really, when my son left, my husband freaked out, asking why the fuck he came over and all this stuff. He said he knew he was coming, but he didnt want to fucking talk or see him. 

My husband doesn't like us bringing his name up at all in the apartment. So even though I DID tell him he was sober and living in NYC, he didn't care. 

So what the hell do I do? I tried having a sit down with my husband but he just dismissed everything I said. I told him to toughen up and stop acting like a baby over this, and that it was his son, and he said ""that boy is no son of mine, hes just another junkie who stole from us"". I couldn't believe him. 

So what am I supposed to do? Tell him his father still hates him? How do I get through to my husband?

Edit: I said 5 years in the title, it was more like 4 and a half years.

864,throwxyz22,Breakups,4gklvc,1679,"I'll keep this short.

My ex, Ross and I broke up over a year ago now. We started growing apart and wanted different things out of life. We have kept things civil, kept each other on social media but we don't talk, unless we see each other in public. I have decided to stay single until I finish my masters, but he now has a new girlfriend, Krystal. 

I was very close with Ross's family. I still have them all on Facebook but we don't talk unless it's to wish each other a Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday, etc. Only a handful of times a year out of respect for Ross. They do ""like"" my posts, especially his mother. I asked Ross if he would rather I unfriend them, but he says he's cool with it and not to worry.

The other day, I received a notification from Ross's mom. She shared a ""memory"" with me in it; it was of myself, Ross and his younger brother when we were on vacation three years ago. His mom wrote ""Miss the beach! Can't wait for summer!""

I thought it was a little weird and awkward to say the least, but I didn't say anything. A few hours later, I received a Facebook message from Krystal, saying:

""u/throwxyz22, I don't know why you feel the need to still keep tabs on Ross's family, but you need to back off. Accept the fact that he is MY boyfriend and please remove yourself as his friend as well as the rest of the family's. I have replaced you and you serve no purpose to be in their lives anymore. Grow up and get over yourself.""

I haven't even responded, but I am so confused. I have met Krystal once when I bumped into them grocery shopping. Ross introduced us and we exchanged pleasantries; she seemed really kind.

What do I say? Do I say anything to Ross or his mother? Talk to Krystal herself? I didn't even share the post! I'm so confused.

TLDR - My ex's mom shared a Facebook memory that included my ex, his brother and myself. His girlfriend sent me an angry Facebook message telling me to get over them.

Hi all! It's been a while, but I thought I'd toss an update to yall.

First, I'm not trying to woo my dance instructor. I am a teenager. I have a crush. It is my first crush. It is embarrassing. I'll get over it.

I've always given gifts to teachers. I had a woman who was an Aggies fan, I got her a stuffed mascot. Teacher liked the beach, so I got him a little seashell figurine. When I was learning to bake, I brought in stuff for my teachers.

So bringing him gifts from a con did not occur to me as strange. We made food for my first instructer, and students bring in snacks and stuff for theirs.

Anyways, he liked them a lot. At first he was kind of confused, and really surprised when he realized we were giving him presents. He put on the light up sunglasses and did the robot in front of a mirror. It was adorable. When he found the pins, he put them on his shirt and showed them off to the others.

So, I guess it went well.

866,,Dating,7moev5,1676,"Title says it all, but basically, I matched with a guy who lied about his age. 

I have my age filters set for a reason, and it's not something I'm in the mood to debate. I may consider older if it were someone I met through work or school, but for the purposes of online dating, 30 is absolutely my max age.

He revealed to me his age after *two weeks* of chatting via phone. Kept making comments about how he was older, then said ""I am 36."" The app shows you your listed age basically every time you click on your profile. There's no way he did not know his age showed as 30.

So I told him he was a little too old for me and he never responded. I was morbidly curious to see if that was even his real age, so I reverse-searched his phone and found out, based on his college grad date of 1996, he is at least 42. That is with skipping some grades. I would put his estimated age at 44 - 45. 

Also, he used old photos to look much younger (ones Google search shows taken in like 2003).

This is REALLY bothering me. I know dating gets harder after 40, and I could understand someone fudging on 1 or 2 years (I wouldn't do it) so you get into the 30 - 39 bracket, but TWELVE to FIFTEEN YEARS? 

Am I morally obligated to report him to the app? He has my phone number and stuff, so I don't want to endanger myself.

First, I want to thank everyone who gave me advice in the previous threads. I didn't expect it to get as much attention as it did, and I'm grateful that I got a lot of advice. 

The last few days have been hell. I don't know how else to say it, so there it is. I made my posts this past Thursday morning/afternoon, and that evening, I got a call from my parents. My ex-girlfriend had dropped off our daughter at their house and was acting strangely. She wouldn't hug or kiss my daughter goodbye and wouldn't answer any questions. She just said that she had an emergency at work and had to be there ASAP. Her disposition, according to my dad, was numb and cold. 

Not five minutes after that call, my ex texts me to say that I ""finally got what [I] wanted"", that she ""won't be bothering [me] anymore"", to take care of our daughter and tell her that she loves her. I recognized this behavior, called 911, told them the story, said where she worked and where she lived. As I suspected, she attempted suicide in her house. I have no idea why she did this. She has recovered and is now in an inpatient mental facility. Probably will be there for a couple of months, and in the mean time, I will be seeking full custody of my girl.

On the bright side, my parents have offered to change their rec room with a bathroom into a living space for me and my daughter. The one-bedroom apartment would be too small to have her all night and day all the time, so we thought it would be best to move in together and give her a good family support system until I can rent a small home or a two-bedroom apartment. It means an hour long work commute for me for now, but oh well. I'm moving in the day before Thanksgiving, and yes, my daughter will have her own bed and space. 

Another bummer: my girlfriend (26F, no kids, together for 9 months) broke up with me Saturday evening after hearing the news. She says that being more than an hour apart is a problem for her, and she isn't ready to take on a ""mother"" role now that I will probably have my kid full time now (they hadn't been introduced yet). I am pretty sad and disappointed, but I'm glad she was honest and didn't bother to waste my time. Considering what is all going on now, I don't have the energy to maintain a romantic relationship anyway. 

It could be worse, but it could be a hell of a lot better, too.

Hello everyone! I wanted to update because my wife has turned 18 and we have officially been in the US for a week now. 

A was hesitant to go for a few weeks, but I went ahead and filed the paperwork as soon as I could. We were approved to go through the work visa for myself, and A went on a special circumstance visa (we paid a lot of money for her visa). 

As soon as we got to the U.S., I took her shopping. She got whatever clothes she wanted and had a fun time. She immediately started wearing her Western clothes and the new headscarves I bought her. We joined a mosque and she has already started making friends with some of the college students who also attend the mosque. 

EDIT: Had to delete this part on the advice of someone. 

A has been absolutely loving her freedom. The last time we cam to the U.S., she was underage and limited. Now that she is 18, she realized she could do whatever she liked. She bought a pack of cigarettes and went for a walk at midnight. They are small freedoms, but it's something she couldn't do before. She has been so excited for her future plans and can't keep quiet about how she wants to enroll in college. She has to pass an English exam first, but she already went to the bookstore and bought a study guide (she was thrilled to be able to walk to the store alone). 

I have a feeling that A and I will be happy for quite some time. We still have to get permanent residence, but it's nice to experience life in the US while we are here. It's an unconventional relationship, but it's the best we can do for now. I have high hopes that we will both have the fulfillment in life we deserve.

Wow, all I can say is thanks for all the advice  last time. I guess what I wanted was the father I thought I had but since I posted this a lot has happened  with my family.

Two days after I made this thread my sister's  oldest kid did decided that he wanted to surf down a hill on his sled when his mom was busy with his brother, something only a 10 year old would think is smart. He ended up breaking his wrist and his leg badly enough that he needed multiple operations. He is doing better now but Trish is exhausted taking care of him and on top of it she's pregnant with her 3rd kid.

This has left our dad at the bottom of her concerns and he has not taken it well. When I spoke with her she said that he was driving  her crazy and kept trying to guilt trip her, saying ""you can't find the time for a widowed old man?"" and basically  being a huge pain in the ass. 

My brother said that he pretty much accepted that our dad would act like that when he wasn't the center of attention. I guess that being that youngest I was shielded from his behavior even before he met Susan. Ron said that our dad would call him a faggot  multiple times as a kid and that when he did come out to the family, dad just told him to shut up. I should also mention that even though he struggled a bit after college, Ron ended up getting a pretty decent job with a high salary. After Susan and our dad found out they tried to bill him for the few weeks he lived with them and even threatened to call the cops. He ended up giving them a couple thousand to get them off his back and went full blown no contact.

There were also more incidents I mentioned in the last thread. He offered to watch his brother's  kid after his own wife died but backed out at the last second, that brother now refuses to have any contact with him as well. And I also found out that the only reason he agreed to Coparent with our mom was because she told him that if he didn't spend time with us she would go after him for more child support.

I was beyond disgusted. After talking with my girlfriend and she read some of the replies in the thread, she suggested that maybe him and I should go out for lunch and just see how it goes. Since we will only be in town for another month before we go off grid unail the fall I agreed. I knew that I would regret it if I didn't go and it was eating me up inside.

It was the most awkward moment of my life. I met him at the diner he chose and I was pretty shocked to see how much he changed. He gained a lot of weight since the last time I saw him (100+ pounds) and he looks decades older than his real age. Plus he kept making comments about the way my girlfriend dreadlocks look ""dirty"" and made a rude joke about me looking like Charles Manson when I showed him our pre engadment pics. Finally after he was done complaining I asked how he was doing he just said ""how do you think?"". He just listed off how his wife was dead, his kids won't give him the time of day, he up to his eyes in debt, and even bitched about the poor service in the diner.

After lunch I he offered me a ride back to my place and offered to put my bicycle  in the back of his truck too, the only kind thing he said. I turned him down and told him to take care of himself. I just don't think I can have any sort of relationship  with him after all. I talked with my girlfriend all night and she said that maybe I turned Susan into a scapegoat  for my dad's  rotten behavior and that I didn't  want to accept the type of man he really was.

Right now I'm focusing on the positive things in my life. My nephew is recovering  well with a third one due in the summertime. My brother is getting married this June and my girlfriend and I are planning to get engaged  shortly after wards. My dad's rejection still hurts like hell but I plan on working past it.

Tldr; my dad is an asshole  and I do not need him in my life.

I'd like to thank everyone who gave me the push I needed to seek answers. Especially **U/dontletthemlietou**, can't believe a complete stranger put so much effort to help out. 

On to update, 

I decided to take the advice and write Amy a letter so that when I finally visited her I would have my thoughts collected. And if she didn't want to see me at least I could give her the letter and let her decide what she wanted to do from that moment on. 

Writing the letter was probably the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life so far. I didn't know when to stop, I didn't know whether to tell her how much she meant to me or to focus on helping her so that she knew regardless of what happened between us she would always have my support. 

I decided not to censor myself, I ended up with a very long letter (15 page total) and was thinking of cutting it short but I decided against it. I think condensing 5 best years of my life into these pages helped me come to terms with things. What ever happened I was going to be okay. I let her know that I was there for her for support and if what she needed was to never see me again than that would be okay too. But I needed answers. 


After a lot of procrastination, I decided to visit Amy with the letter. Probably stood at the door for a good 30 min before finally knocking. Waiting for the door to open ? yeah that was an interesting experience. Never thought my heart could beat that fast. I actually thought about turning back and just walking away or to leave the letter but I couldn't really get myself to move so I waited. 

She opened the door and just froze when she saw me. We didn't say anything for god knows how long. I thought movies were full of shit with this bullshit but when it happens to you - you know. You can't really do anything, you're waiting for her to speak and shes just staring at you as if shes just seen a ghost. 

I decided to break the silence and asked her how she was feeling she didn't reply but just started crying. We were both still standing at the door and it was really awkward but man I had missed her so much. I don't think I was prepared to see her cry and everything I thought from before hand didn't matter. 

She then hugged me and we both just cried into each other. 

**So nothing went the way I planned it and I won't drag this on for too long but I got the answer I wanted**

Remember how I said her grandmother had passed away from cancer ? well it turns out she wasn't the only one. 

She hadn't mentioned this before so I guess I was clueless. 

When she was 12, her aunt was diagnosed with cancer. Now Amys mother and her aunt were extremely close so she was basically staying with them. Her aunt was young was in her mid 30s so this was unexpected for them. She saw her aunt deteriorate and she saw how this was affecting her mother. Over time though the treatment stated kicking in and they thought she was doing really well and recovering. 

6 month in her aunt dies of stroke unexpectedly. Her mother completely shuts down after this. She was severely depressed, wouldn't eat or talk to anyone for well into a year. She didn't know how to help her. 

She didn't want that for us. She thinks regardless of how good a treatment is, cancer increases risk of death from other things and people aren't prepared for it. Just as you think you've finally beaten it, it comes back and bites you. Shes come to terms with it for herself but she doesn't want what her mother went through to be repeated in me. She thinks I'm not stronger than her mom and that this would kill me. 


Shes also not sure if she wants children anymore. She does not want any regardless of the outcome. She doesn't want to put a child through this. She seems convinced that her cancer will return even if they can stop it now. 

Since I wanted children, she doesn't want to put me in a situation where Id have to choose and end up resenting her. 


She doesn't want to see me go through that and pretend to be okay with it all. 

She read the letter and was emotional and kind of laughed at my stupid line ""let me know if what you want is to be with others"" 

She doesn't want anyone else, never has never will. I was her first and shes damn sure I will be her last. 

I tried talking some sense into her. How could she think that I could watch her go through this alone and not suffer ? Her mother had time with her sister to spend these days that I'm sure she was grateful for. I said a lot more but I'm tired and you guys are probably exhausted just reading this. 

We ended up spending the night together but shes still stubborn and claims I should stay away. I told her I wasn't going away, she can have me as a friend if she doesn't want to go back to us but I'm not going anywhere. I reminded her that she would kick my ass for even thinking this if it was me that was ill. she smiled and kissed me so I think I can win her over.

Now Belle and and I have been friends since kindergarten, meaning that they both are like sisters to me. I?ve been to their house thousands of times times and Vice Versa. Her little sister, Becca, has always been a charming, seemingly violent person who has shown no emotional output for as long as I?ve known them. As time goes on, she?s becoming more and more frightening. From the time she was little, Becca would always sabotage us and get us in trouble. Whether it was a blatant lie that was brilliantly told by her, or one of us gave her the slightest nudge to which she sprawled on the ground and pretended to be hurt. Whenever we?d get in trouble, when we got back to Belle?s room, and her sister would be waiting with a smile and eyes that read ?don?t fuck with me.? 

When we were 9, Belle went to the bathroom, so it was just me and a then 7 year old Becca. We were playing with dolls when all of a sudden Becca out of nowhere says ?you know I could kill you right?? I looked at her confused and she responded with, ?I could easily kill you. I know how you walk home and I know where you live.? Then she started to say something about setting me on fire, but Belle came back and she reverted back to talking about doll stuff. The scariest part of that was her face. It was completely blank, and her eyes had the same ?don?t fuck with me? look as they had all those times before. It baffles now to think about this bead she was only 7 saying these type of things. And she never said anything or showed any types of signs that she was kidding.

Not sure what exactly it was, but it was a nice fish that Belle really liked taking care of. Becca comes in asks us for $10. We say no because 1. I don?t have it on me and 2. She didn?t want to give her money. She begs and we say no. She then stays and mills around while me and her older sister talk. I notice she?s looking at the fish tank for a really long time. Then all of a sudden she reached in and grabbed the fish and ran. We chased her all they way to the kitchen, Belle yelling and pleading the entire time. Becca stops at the sink, holds it over the drain, and puts her finger by the garbage disposal switch and demands that we give her $10. Belle frantically goes in her wallet and gives he 10, to which Becca casually tosses me the fish and walks away. 

Fast forward to Me and Belle?s senior year of high school, Becca still being a sophomore. Becca was insanely popular in her grade, basically running it. But I later found out she was ruling through fear. She was a huge bully; attacking kids, threatening kids lives and sometimes their families, and saying really cruel things. The teachers loved her so the few kids who tried to speak up were accused of exaggerating. 

I once tried to text one her friends about it, asking her does she threaten her life and if she?s cruel. To no surprise at all, she replies ?stop texting Me.?  It scares me because I know what kind of person Becca is and it scares me that I don?t know what she?s doing to the people she calls ?friends.? The one time I tried to tell Belle that I think her sister is a psychopath, she scorned me and told me to never talk about her little sister again, which was fucking weird because WE WITNESSED THE SAME THINGS. What should I do? How do I go about helping her? Knowing Becca, if she isn?t helped or stopped, she?ll either become a serial killer, some type of enforcer, or some type of cult leader.

ORGINAL STORY 

 ""Long Story short, I caught my ex fiancee cheating on me with a common friend of ours. A few months prior, I had proposed to her with a family heirloom, my grandmothers engagement ring (I thought she was the love of my life, boy was I wrong).
Rightfully, after I dumped her, I asked for the ring back, being that it?s a family heirloom. She said she is not going to give the ring back because I gave it to her, and she thinks that ?There?s a chance we?re going to get back together one day?. I told her that She?s delusional and I want nothing to do with her, and told her to give me the ring back right now but she flat out refused. I didn?t want to use physical force on her because there is a better way. I just want to get my ring back and move on. What do I do?
tl;dr: My cheating ex-fiancee won?t give me my grandmothers engagement ring back.""






Again, going to keep this short. I took some of your guys? advice about kind of sneakily getting the ring back from my ex fiancee. 

So, this morning I text her saying that I should meet her to discuss our future together, and of course she jumped at the offer so we meet at her place. When I get there, I notice she wasn?t wearing the ring, which at first kind of made me nervous that she had ?lost? the ring or sold it.

 I asked her about this she said it was in its box in her bedroom because she doesn?t wear jewelry at home or something. Then I started coming up with some bullshit about us getting together in the future and that i should have the ring back to propose again sometime but she said she didn?t want to give me the ring back because to her ?it symbolizes our love for each other and i?m willing to make this commitment to you and prove to you i won?t mess it up again? I nearly gagged when she said that and just nodded. I wanted to just get out of her life for good, but not without my grandmothers ring. 

She got up to make some coffee for us and I asked her to use the restroom, but when the coast was clear I entered her bedroom and i found the ring and put it in my pocket. When I entered the living room again I told her this was never going to work out and that I will not be speaking to her ever again and left. The ring is now back in my safe. Hopefully I can give it to one truly amazing girl one day. Thanks for the advice and for listening guys. 

Edit 1: For everyone who?s been asking about my ex?s reaction, all I heard when I was walking (running) out of her place was my name being screamed and asshole. She?s been texting and calling me all day saying that how dare I take her ring and that I?m the asshole. I?m just going to block her now. 

Edit 2: Texted her a picture of me wearing the ring on the tip of my ring finger, then i blocked her.

875,throwaway38281,Updates,3ainpn,1668,"From the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/368y6h/my_48m_estranged_brother_50m_who_caused_my_family/):
TL;dr: My older brother bullied me for being homosexual and made my family disown me after he outed me. We haven't spoken in 24 years. He recently contacted me on FB because his son, who I've never met, has come out and he wants me to help my nephew. I kind of want to tell him to go to hell. But I kind of want to help this poor kid.

Thanks for the advice, guys.  I read your comments, which for the most part solidified my resolve to keep doing what I was doing.  That is, nothing. As many redditors noted, Rick and his son have a ton of resources, support groups, counselors, etc., at their fingertips.  They don't need a disowned stranger to help.

However, you guys also raised a bunch of questions I wanted answered, namely how much does this boy know about me, if at all, and how much does he know about his father's role as my bully.  Following the advice some of you gave, I called my sister, Sally, shortly after I posted the original thread and told her about Rick's facebook message.  She was surprised but happy that he contacted me.  She was thrilled that he apologized.  She was confused about what he said regarding her nephew, Harry.

According to Sally, Harry who is 16 (sorry) has not come out, at least not to her. She described him as a rather average kid, and while she didn't speculate on his sexuality, she did say he wasn't nearly as obvious as I had been.

Sally called me after Memorial Day, asking to see the Facebook message.  She spoke to Rick and apparently I misread the intent of his rambling.  Rick wanted to apologize, first and foremost.  As for Harry, apparently Rick suspects he may be gay and is worried that because of his history with me his son is pulling away from him and wouldn't feel comfortable coming out. So to answer the questions you guys raised, Harry knows all about my being his disowned gay uncle and exactly why I was disowned though I doubt he know the extent of how badly his father harassed me.  

I was under the impression that my name was never mentioned in Rick's family, but apparently they talk about me all the time as the man who won't forgive and get over the past. That kind of stings, partly because he just now contacted me for the first time and partly because it's true.  Also apparently Rick really thought that we'd make up and become pals and so when I spoke with his son I wouldn't mention what he had done to me or at least that it was he who did it.

TL;dr - Called sister who spoke with my older brother for me. My nephew may or may not be gay, but he knows about me and that his dad had me kicked out of the family. My brother wants to fix things between us so his son won't despise him if he is actually gay.",1434814932.0,Update - My [48M] estranged brother [50M] who caused my family to disowned me for being gay contacted me because he needs help with his son [14?M],0.91

TL;DR from the old thread, my dad retired, undermined my mother and I, was lying about his professional past and generally being a slob.

As I mentioned last thread, my mother agreed to let me replace my door with a doggie door and change the locks.  She also instituted a do nothing for my dad campaign.

The latter came to a head first.  I heard raised voices on Christmas day, and then my mom came over to my apartment, asking if she could lay low.  It turns out my dad opened his drawers and realized he was out of clean underwear.  He came to where my mom was and demanded she wash his laundry.  My mom replied she had just come off of a 50 hour work week, and he was more than capable of doing his own wash.

My father, apparently, started yelling and flipping out.  He left and came back with his underwear and started throwing it at my mom, which is when she left and came over.  We heard dad leave soon afterwards (no idea where he went to).  Mom left his underwear where they laid, including a pair that was sort of dangling from the Christmas tree.  

Mom and I ended up watching Christmas movies, eating cookies and talking.  I found out mom had actually started talking to a divorce lawyer, but wasn't 100% set on what she was doing yet.  It also turns out that mom has been sleeping in the guest room for the past few weeks, ever since my father refused to wash the bedding.  Also, my parents finances aren't what I thought they were, thanks to poor investments on my dad's part a decade ago. 

My family actually celebrated Christmas on New Years Eve, as it worked better with our schedules.  The day of my niece arrived and, as only a toddler can, asked why there were underpants on the Christmas tree.  I replied they were her grandfather's, and she repeated the question to him.  My dad finally picked them up.

One brother has been super supportive of mom.  The other has been more reluctant.  But when dad wasn't helping at all with getting food together, and making snarky comments, I think they realized how bad things were.  Before lunch, they pulled my dad into his office and tried to talk to him about what's going on.  My dad started yelling instead, just saying that neither of them could give any feedback on his marriage, as both of them had ""failed"" to get married, and how they were both ""failures"" ""losers"", and making some points that were a bit more personal and specific.  

One of my brothers started yelling back calling him on his history and behavior.  Then I heard the back door slam and dad left.  We had lunch and did presents, etc, without him.  Dad came back around 11 pm.  We had all decided we wouldn't let him ruin our holiday, so we sort of ignored him.  He ended up talking to me just after midnight, saying things like did I think he would have to date women older than me (????)

New Years day, I'm playing Fallout and there's a knock at my door.  It's my dad and his friend.  The friend, I dislike.  He has a son who is living with him, and is by all accounts a deadbeat.  Even though my situation is completely different, my dad tends to borrow his language about me.  At this point, I think my dad had been drinking (which is really uncharacteristic of him).  He tries to shove past me, saying that I'm hiding something with changing the locks.  I say I cleared that with mom, who is my landlord.  I'm in my rights and he can't enter my apartment.

Dad at this point starts making sarcastic comments about how I'm not even paying rent.  I shut the door in his face.  Now, I work for a bank and study accounting.  I have full records of my rent payments, etc.   I print those out, along with a copy of my lease and the written permission to change the locks and back door.  I come out to where dad is at his car and hand those to my dad and say if he wants I can get a copy for his friend too.  

My dad blew up my cell phone for embarrassing him in front of his friend.

Then yesterday happened.  I had to catch up on a ton of work and came in on the afternoon of my day off.  I came in exhausted around 8 at night.  I'm heating up some food and dad knocked on my door.  He said that Piper was missing.  Piper was my grandmother's (dad's mom) dog who my parents took in after her death.  I freaked out and asked what happened.  My dad told this weird story that he came over, but my door was locked and then for some reason he left the side door to his house open.  It really didn't make sense except that he was indirectly blaming my locked door, somehow?

I asked if he had looked through the house, he said no.  I did a quick search of my apartment (Piper comes over through the dog door to visit my dog), then ran through my parents house calling to her.  The side door, at this point, was still open

Not finding her, I started outside, calling to Piper and shaking her treat tin.  I made it across my block, then started further out.  Suddenly a security car came up beside me and asked if I was looking for a dog.  I said yes, gave a description, and they said they had had a non emergency call that a dog was found by a family.  He volunteered to drive me to their house.

The house we ended up at was over a half mile away, near the highway.  I was freaked out because if Piper made it that far, she crossed a few busy roads.  The family had Piper in their dog run, she was soaking wet.  I thanked them and they at this point told me they found her around 2 pm.

I saw red.  The security guy gave Piper and I a ride back, and pulled up to my house.  My mom had gotten home and was outside looking for Piper.  Dad came out around this time.  I confronted him, asking when Piper got out.  He admitted it was around noon.  Not only had he not looked for Piper, he hadn't even closed the door.  For eight hours.  I go to put Piper inside, fuming and dad blocks me.  He was angry that Piper was wet, and said I should keep her in my ""basement"".  

I lost it, yelled this wouldn't be an issue if dad had behaved like an adult.  And at that moment, dad reached over, grabbed me by the shoulders and started shaking me, yelling at me.

Thankfully, the security guy was there.  I heard him yell to dad to let me go.  Dad let me go and went to go back in the house, but my mom was in the doorway and told him to get out.  He slapped my mom.

The security guy was on dad, told him to back off.  Dad sort of seemed to realize how over the top he was, and got super subdued and started to joke around like it was a whole laughing matter.

Mom said she wanted dad gone, security guy said that if dad didn't leave the premises he was calling police.  Dad acted indignant about being kicked out of his house, so security guy actually radioed for assistance.  Dad got in his car and left.  He hasn't been back since.  Police came and took a report (security guy apparently handled things poorly, but was still the witness).  Security has been notified not to let him in the community

Tomorrow mom sees the divorce lawyer and will start filing papers.  This, apparently, wasn't the first time dad hit her (which I wasn't aware of), but she said she wasn't going to let a man who abused her children in her life or her grandchildren's lives.  My brothers have both voiced their support.

I don't know how I feel, I have no idea my situation with living here.  I'm upset because of dad shaking me, no one has ever physically attacked me before.  I'm super nervous whenever I hear the cars go by the house.  This morning I didn't walk the dogs because I got too anxious.

Thank you for letting me vent, reddit.  I don't know where my family goes from here, but changes are happening.

 
**tl;dr**: Dad was an asshole throughout the holidays.  Ended up attacking mom and I.  Parents are divorcing.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Edit:  A day later, no one knows where my dad is, and I just got a text from mom saying she was about to head into the lawyer's.

Yesterday, I had a long conversation with my brother.  There's a ton I apparently didn't know about of my dad's history.  I'll upgrade him from ""bit of a jerk"" to ""complete asshole"".  My mom and my older brothers both sort of sheltered me from a lot of it, I guess.  I was completely unaware of some of the behaviors and stories of dad acting out, being abusive, etc.

In retrospect, I really had little contact with my father growing up.  It may seem weird, but he would come home from work and hole up in his closet.  Sundays we always spent with my grandmother, Saturdays mom planned outings.  Dad was really only present for family holidays and at the dinner table.  I feel horrible my mom shouldered keeping the family together for so long.

I did tell my brother that there's some concern about dad's mental/physical health.  When dad gets back in contact with us, my brother is going to try to coax him to see a doctor.

Her engagement fell apart because she just couldn't do it anymore. She wasn't in any state to get married and ended things completely, we all tried to convince that maybe just putting off the wedding but not ending the engagement was a good idea but she cut off her fiance of 5 years (engaged for 1.5 yrs at the time) and just spiraled downwards. So I asked her to move in with me and she did.

She won't open up to our parents or sister (younger). She's ignored all her friends and even her best friend has stopped trying though she's admitted it's something my sister will need to work through when she's ready but she (the best friend) has to focus on herself and her own marriage and child for now.

Thanks for all the advice, I have a happy update for you. She showed up at my new job yesterday to surprise me and she's going to be staying out here. The reason she kept putting off moving was that she found out she is pregnant (it wasn't planned) and was scared to go through pregnancy and have the baby without her mom close by to help. She finally told her mom on Monday and her mom reassured her and bought her a plane ticket and sent her on her way. 

As exciting as that news is, she's known for about two months now and only told me yesterday, so clearly we have a lot to work on. We think there was just way too much going on at once, with the move, my new job, her quitting hers, our engagement, etc and now the pregnancy. It was just too stressful for her.

Hi all! I have to say, I really am blown away by the diplomacy and sympathy I received with my first post; I really thought this was a pretty mild topic that wouldn't receive too much attention so I'm really grateful for everyone that took the time to comment! Seriously, once I hit 7 up votes/4 comments I thought that would be the end of it!  


I want to clarify and expand on a few details before I dive into the updated situation: First, I have absolutely NO ego about my job.  I'm a freaking waitress! I'm completely aware it's unskilled labor and certainly doesn't take any specific skill to be competent at it.  That said, I LOVE my job. I served and bartended through two college degrees and kept on going afterward- I have a BLAST at work! But I am absolutely aware that my wife is a significantly more valuable employee and were this a simple employment situation, I would happily just move to a new job.


I also wanted to clarify on the owner's wife's interference when I snapped at her.  She wasn't simply checking on tables/refilling water glasses/pre-bussing tables (pre-bussing = clearing empty plates from the table while diners are still seated).  At one point she was standing at one of my tables for about 3-4 minutes (which is a LONG ASS TIME in the restaurant world) talking about: her 4 kids and which ones still breastfed/her mortgage/how much they would lose if the business failed/the application process my wife went through to become the head chef/the owner's wife's own work history, etc.  It was incredibly inappropriate and a really invasive service style. I usually don't even let my own guests know I'm married to the chef unless it organically comes up in conversation! Multiple tables were actively complaining to me about her service style, which led to the (admittedly petty) comment I made to her.    


Anyway, I went in to meet the owner.  I asked our bar manager to be present at the meeting as well (bar manager is a longtime friend of the owner and was present for the initial altercation and the private conversation the owner's wife and I had).  So the three of us chatted for about 5 minutes- I said very little, and mostly took the general advice here of deferring to whatever my boss said (I generally employed three key phrases: ""I understand"" ""You're absolutely right"" and ""I'm sorry"").  My bar manager (with whom I primarily work with, rather than the owner) completely shut down any tense moments by immediately telling the owner that I was ""a self-assured, seasoned server who needed little to no direction"" and that ""(owner's wife's name) overstepped her boundaries in a big way, which led to a pretty understandable reaction from (me).""  The owner pretty much deflated after that; he hemmed and hawed a bit about me being inappropriate (to which I agreed) and then repeatedly told me his wife ""had no problem"" with me.  I cheerfully answered ""great! I look forward to working with her next shift!"" and that essentially ended the conversation.  I did ask the owner point blank if his wife was considered my superior when we worked together; he looked confused and clarified that no, she was considered my complete equal both on the floor and off.  (He also FIRMLY stuck to his guns in being justified in discussing my personnel/performance issues with my wife, a statement to which I again deferred.) 


That was the planned end of my update until a pretty serious conversation with my wife last night.  Prior to/aside from this altercation, there have been some instances that my wife witnessed that really made her question if we should invest with them; apparently our owner has been getting HAMMERED on his shifts (he works alone behind the bar a few days early in the week, whereas I work the later week days and the weekend) to the point where he has: FALLEN OVER in front of guests behind the bar/completely unable to make cocktails (we're an upscale craft cocktail bar)/visibly intoxicated and heavily slurring; generally giving terrible, drunk service.  The breaking point for my wife was TWO 1-star yelp reviews within minutes of each other specifically calling out his service.  One guest had to actually go to the kitchen window to get her own food.  Reddit! It's TERRIBLE! I was completely appalled and upset for/with her, and we both agreed this is NOT the way we want to run a business and reiterated to each other that any potential partnership with this couple wasn't going to happen.  We're both professionally serious people, both COMMITTED to her career goal and neither of us will do anything to jeopardize that.  


Anyway! So we're both on the same page.  We're keeping our savings intact and completely mentally/emotionally checked out of going into business with this couple and generally getting all of our ducks in a row to head back to Vegas so she can get back into some of the top-tier restaurants out there.  Our lease is up in November so we'll just ride it out until then.  Reddit I really appreciate the attention this query received; I really felt a bit unmoored with how to handle it and I'm glad that you all essentially told me to follow my instincts and play it safe/close to the vest.  That's it! Thanks everyone!

881,throwingthrowthrown,Relationships,3ln4e1,1666,"Hello, Reddit.

This is really awkward and embarrassing to share, but I can't think of anywhere else to get advice. I've been dating James for just over a year. We have a really good relationship and we are good with communicating any issues that we have come to, I am very much in love with him and we are happy. Now, maybe he is very comfortable with me now; which I know is a good thing, but I'm very frustrated and I don't know if it's just me. This is the only issue I have with him. He's just constantly farting and burping and it's starting to really gross me out. It feels stupid to even type that... but it's really become excessive.

We are both graduated from school and work full time, we do not live together but he is starting to move into my apartment. This started about 5 months into our relationship and it has gotten progressively worse. He will burp constantly and blow it into my face, to a point where I will start dry heaving, because he thinks it's funny. He does the same thing with farting, always trying to do it on me because he thinks it's hilarious. I know its normal, I grew up with 4 brothers, but he is constantly FORCING it to happen.

This is not once or twice. We have spent almost every night together the past 6 months, and it will happen all night. ALL night. I have asked him to please stop because I find it really gross, especially the burping because he will do it in my face and it turns my stomach and he will apologize but still continue to do it. Or lean in for a kiss and burp in my face instead, then laugh himself to the point of tears when I act disgusted.

I thought maybe, at first, he was just really gassy and I should be more understanding because it's a natural bodily function. He does not do this when we are out to dinner or with friends. A few months ago we went to a wedding together with some members of his family and he accidentally burped really loudly like he normally does when he is alone with me, and our table went really silent and glared at him. I didn't want him to be embarrassed so I highfived him and said ""Good one!"" and the whole table started laughing and cheering and he afterwards he pulled me aside and said he was thankful I did so, as he was humiliated but I broke the ice. I was a bit drunk and frustrated so I asked him why he does it to me constantly but he wouldn't do it in front of other people. His reasoning is that I am his girlfriend and he should be able to ""play around"" with me like that. That I was being a typical girl for finding it rude, uptight, high maintenance. I didn't want to argue about it, so I told him I was none of those things and he knew it -- cut the bullshit, we'll talk about it later when we're sober and just have a fun time at the party for now. And we did. But it never changes.

I've tried to make plans to be out of the house when we see each other, because even though it seems ridiculous it's starting to stress me out. I can't talk to any of my friends about it because they think it's so funny. He is a very sweet guy, I like spending time with him, but I feel nauseous when we are alone together because it's just so gross. He is starting to work longer shifts so he wants to stay in a lot most nights to relax. He started doing it during sex, as a joke, and our sex life has really suffered because of it.

A few nights ago he was texting me before he got off work, complaining about his day and he seemed really stressed out so I told him I would come over and I'll make his favorite and I'll make him forget about it. So I went over to his house and started cooking until he was off. After dinner he leaned in to kiss me, and I turned my head because I'm so used to him burping in my face. We had an argument because he was accusing me of cheating (we haven't been having sex). I told him it was because of the burping, and he said I needed to get over it, that he was only joking and I was being such a prude. That his girlfriend shouldn't reject a kiss from him yadda yadda. I told him that I've been saying this is a problem for a while, I DON'T think it's funny AT ALL. I have thrown up because of it (he started to laugh as I said that). And I just... kinda lost it. I don't really yell at people, I am a calm and collected person, so I scared him a bit. I told him it was disgusting and I am getting to the point where I'm no longer attracted to him, that I've been trying so hard to be understanding but it's a two way street. It wasn't to me about something being ""gross"" or ""funny"" any more, it was about respect.

He kind of got defensive, trying to throw in how I was overreacting, being ridiculous, but I shut it down and he apologized because he apparently didn't know I felt so strongly about it... He would try not to do it any more, at all. I don't care that it happens! I only care that he forces it. Etc.

Now, having talked it out -- for the next couple of hours he actually didn't try to burp in my face or fart on me. I was so happy I could enjoy cuddling my boyfriend without trying not to vomit. So I started unzipping his pants, to make him forget about his bad day. You already know where this is going. It's humiliating but I'm going to type it out anyway, as I was trying to blow him he pushed my head down so I couldn't get away and tensed up and started farting loudly, while laughing. I was so frustrated I started crying immediately. I think he realized he did something wrong because he let go of my head and tried to hold me and he kept say ""I'm sorry, I thought you meant to do it less. I thought it was going to be funny, to break the tension from before.""  But I got up and left his apartment. 

That was two days ago. He has tried calling me, texting me constantly. I have not responded. His messages range from being very apologetic to very angry, back and forth. I don't know what to do and I feel like this relationship is over but I still love him. I feel also, really gross and violated in a way. Our mutual friends have been texting me as well asking if everything is okay, and I've tried explaining the situation to my best friend but he found it hilarious. So I'm afraid to explain it to anyone else. This is just... so stupid. I literally feel like I'm crazy; maybe I am uptight etc. I also have a lot of his stuff over here that belongs to him and I'm worried he will come back to get it and I'll have to face him. What should I do? Am I just overreacting?

Hello again! I posted a few days ago about leaving my job, and I was surprised at how much attention my post had received. I was expecting one or two responses, max.

Anyway, I did talk to the mom two nights ago. I waited until her work was over (I work based on her hours, not the dad's, but I also feel more comfortable talking to her). I took the advice of a lot of people on the original post and was just completely honest. I told her that I was moving to Florida and that I planned to break up with my SO, and that I really wished I could stay for the family, but that everything outside of work was not enjoyable (which is all true). Her response was, as expected, surprised but understanding. She DID immediately say, ""Well, I know [her friend] knows someone whose been looking.... I'll ask her..."" so she went straight into damage control mode. She also thanked me for giving her so much notice (1 month).

I did tell her that I could train or write something up for the next nanny, which she didn't really respond to (I think she was still trying to figure out who to ask to be the new nanny), but I did get it out there. One of my favorite parts was when I asked her not to mention anything to SO if she saw him out and about (we live less than 5 minutes away so it's possible) and she just looked at me and said ""Why would I EVER tell him?"" It was great.

To the more negative side, at least for me, yesterday after work I stuck around and ate dinner with them, then ... I had sort of a mini breakdown. I know it was totally unprofessional and not okay. But I ended up crying a bit and the mom took me to the front porch and calmed me down. I was crying because I realized, I did NOT want to go home. At all. I was making up any reason to stay. And I told her that as well, and she actually offered to me to stay on their couch if I felt I needed it! What a wonderful woman.

So overall, even though I acted like an idiot and definitely will not use them as a job reference (haha), I would give them an A+ on being decent human beings and helping me out.

883,TheDisputedChampion,Personal issues,4tzud6,1661,"My father passed away in April due to an unexpected stroke. He leaves behind me, my sister [29F], and my mother [67F]. In his will, of course my mother gets to retain her house. He left each of us money and portions of his retirement savings. All told, my sister and I received about fifty-thousand dollars each, plus a few stocks and other investments worth about fifteen to twenty thousand dollars more, increasing over time with interest. My mother of course received more because she is his wife. She was really humble and ashamed as if she did something wrong, promising my sister and me that we would inherit everything when she's gone. I told her to keep her money and enjoy it as much as she can. My sister concurs.


Recently the lawyers handling everything have cut a check for each of us. My wife and I (we've been married eight years) discussed several weeks ago that we will just put the money in our retirement fund to combine with the one I get from my job as a teacher.


But my wife kind of bragged to her family that I had received an inheritance and that we were making our retirement more comfortable. We're also considering taking a few thousand dollars to go on a nice summer vacation with our two kids (two boys aged seven and four).


Her mother suggested that I use the money to help my wife's cousins and other family members fulfill their dream of opening a gourmet French restaurant. None of us are French but my wife's cousin is supposedly finishing culinary school and he says he will be the chef.


My wife's mother is really manipulative and has convinced my wife that our using my inheritance money to fund the family restaurant idea is the right thing to do, and that if my mother is unable to convince me to devote all or at least most of it to the restaurant idea, then my wife has the right to at least give them half (ie, twenty-five thousand dollars).


I do not like this idea at all, especially giving them all the money but even half of it. I asked my wife why don't they just borrow money from the bank, but it turns out none of them have very good credit. When I ask how they will ever pay me back, my wife's mother insists that I will be paid back by restaurant profits.


Personally I think it's all a stupid idea and doomed to failure, but my wife is now convinced that this is the best course of action and that if she fails to come through for her family, it is a sign of disloyalty.


I don't think my dad intended his money to be used to pay for some jackass idea that will most likely fail. None of these people know what they're doing, but at the same time I don't want to disappoint my wife.


When I offered my mother in law ten thousand dollars out of the fifty, she kind of turned up her nose at it like I was selfish and insulting her.


I really don't care what she thinks but I do care about what my wife thinks.


Just looking for advice on what to do, what compromises to make, just comments in general. Thank you Reddit.

884,BAP0223,Infidelity,4j6jn9,1656,"My boyfriend, John, and I have been together for 3 years- living together for almost 1. IMO, we?ve had a really good relationship and I haven?t had a reason to not trust him. I?ve never ?snooped? through a SO?s phone or computer, as I believe privacy is important and I know I value my own privacy. BUT this latest incident has me questioning that?
 
So?
 
Three nights ago John and I were on the couch watching a movie. I was sitting and John was lying with his head on my lap. His phone kept vibrating because he was in the middle of a group message with his family. They were discussing plans about an upcoming trip this summer. We were both reading the messages because I was included (I didn?t have my phone by me to read them myself on my phone). John then opened up his email app because he had gotten a notification. The email was from Match.com.
 
John quickly swiped and deleted it. I said ?what was that from?? And he said ?just spam.? I then asked ?was that from Match.com?? He said ?no, I don?t know what it was.? It was a blatant lie. I just kind of looked at him, giving him a chance to tell the truth and he snapped and said ?it wasn?t, ok?!? I said ok and went back to watching the movie. He was standoff-ish and didn?t check his phone the rest of the night while I was around. We didn?t talk about it anymore.
 
Now, I don?t care if John used a dating website before we met. I know that a lot of people build lasting relationships from online dating. What I do care about is if he?s still on it/paying for the service. I also understand that companies will still send emails after you cancel a service, but why wouldn?t he just say that if that?s the case? We both know what I saw, so there?s no point in denying it.
 
I had gotten over this incident but last night, I noticed something else. My laptop is a POS and hardly ever works (I?m in the process of shopping around for a new one). Because I?m in the process of finishing up my Masters, I?ve been using John?s computer. He told me that I don?t have to ask to use it anymore so when I went to work on some research, it was locked.  It?s never been locked before. Ever. I called him in and told him that I need to use it and if he could type his password in. He said fine and unlocked it. Cool, time to work. I didn?t ask why he locked it. John literally sat behind for me 15 minutes watching me work. Then, for the next hour and a half, he would walk in every 5-10 minutes and see what I was doing. He NEVER did that before. I told him he was distracting me and he said ?just seeing what you?re up to.? I was reading academic articles, like I had told him originally.
 
When we went to bed, I reached for his phone to put on the night stand. We only have one nightstand and it?s on my side. Every night, I take both phones and put them on my night stand. It?s our routine. He walked in and said ?what are you doing with my phone!?? I told him I was putting it on the nightstand. I asked him why he?s being so weird with me and his things. He said ?why are you so concerned about what?s on my stuff??
 
I said that I wasn?t and that he told me I could use his computer whenever I want, that I didn?t go through his phone (I really didn?t),  that I have no idea why he thinks I?m worried about what?s on his things, and that he?s being weird since I asked what that email was. He just kind of huffed and went to sleep. No more was said about it. Today, I had PTO scheduled from work. I?m not really proud of this but I went to see if his computer was locked, it was. So was his iPad, which has never had a passcode on it. I didn?t try to crack the codes because what?s the point? It?s his personal things but I?m still concerned he?s hiding something.
 
So what should I do? I?ve always trusted him but his behavior has me worried. Should I ask him again about the email? Could he be embarrassed that he used match.com? Or is it safe to assume he?s still using it or hiding something else? I don't even know if there's a way to see if he's still using it. 



   
**tl;dr**: I saw an email from match.com when my boyfriend and I were looking at his phone. He denied it after quickly deleting it. Now, his phone, computer, and iPad are now password protected. He's also been snappy with me and accusing me of looking through his things. I'm concerned he isn't being honest with me.

**tl;dr**: Childhood best friend is dying of cancer. I don't know what to do/say to him and he doesn't have much time.


I know my first post didn't get a ton of attention but I figured I'd give an update anyways. It's been a tough week. My friend passed away in the middle of last week. Although I wasn't able to see him in person, I was able to talk to him a few times during his last couple of days. 

I decided to take a majority of the people's advice and pretty much act like we always do with each other. It was kind of surreal; we both knew what was coming but both sort of acted ignorant to the fact. I'm still so happy I was able to have those last few conversations, though.
  
  
The funeral was very tough for me. It was the first time I legitimately cried in 7 years. The last time that happened was when I lost my father and sisters, so I definitely wasn't ready to cry. One thing that made me feel a little better, though, was his family. Pretty much his entire family, even members that I had never met before yesterday, all said how much I was able to cheer him up over the past few months. They all said how much I meant to him, and it really brought a silver lining to this all. 
  
I had been friends with him since the first grade. He was my first friend that I made when I moved to a new town, and was my neighbor all the way up till 10th grade. After the funeral, me and 5 friends (we all went to school together up until 8th grade and have since all went our separate ways) all went out for food and drinks. We shared memories about growing up with each other and with him. I thought it was a great way to memorialize our friend. Needless to say, he will be missed. 
   
**tl;dr**: Friend passed away, I'm sad but doing alright. 

**EDIT**: I want to just thank everybody for the amazing words of encouragement. Although this is a very tough time for me, I do see some good in this all. My friend is no longer suffering, now. I can't begin to say how grateful I am that I was there talking to him during his last few days.

So, the day after I posted I told him. I went over to his house and just blurted it out- I literally yelled ""I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING"" while we were Netflix and chilling. It was not my most graceful moment, but he sat up and held my hand while I confessed. He was definitely surprised, (he later said he thought I was going to tell him I had HIV or was pregnant or something) and all he could say was ""thank you for telling me."" I offered to go and give him some time and space to think it over, but he asked me to stay! I was honestly surprised, I thought he'd want me to leave at least for the night.

But I stayed, and we laid together and he asked me a lot of questions/details. I was an open book--I really just felt so bad for lying by omission I didn't want to hide anything else. Even though it was difficult, it was really therapeutic. He was *so* understanding and apologized for not having been sensitive when he talked about his friend. The only blip was the next day he told his sister what I had shared with him because her fiance is also in recovery, so he wanted her feedback of how to proceed. That stung a bit, especially because I hadn't even met her yet, but I got over it.

I still met his family for Thanksgiving (they loved me!) and we are going strong. I think this brought us together a bit more, I have a habit of not talking about my problems with whomever I am dating, so this thrust me into a very vulnerable/open position.

Thank you everyone for your helpful advice and comments. My post didn't get that much attention but I wanted to update for those finding themselves in a similar situation.


I spent the next day after our fight formulating the words to say to my boyfriend when he got home from work. I wanted our conversation to be as constructive and non confrontational as possible. I explained calmly and rationally how his phone use makes me feel. Infact, I had to explain four or five times because each time he said he didn't understand why him being on his phone so much was an issue. But, I stayed calm and rational and tried to be patient with him. It paid off and we agreed that he wouldn't use his phone unless necessary when we spend time together. He also reassured me that him being on his phone doesn't mean that he doesn't want to spend time with me, and he loves me and isn't bored of me. (Thanks, anxious brain)


We've been engaging in a lot more conversation during our Netflix binges now that I don't feel like I'm interrupting his phone use. And now that he isn't distracted by his phone all the time he initiates conversation about what we're watching. We've spent some time together with my son the last couple of days, and he's been incredibly conscious of his phone use, which I thanked him for, and told him I feel like we really spent some quality time together where he was always 'present'. We're now madly in love again and if the phone thing becomes a problem again, I know I can speak up about it.

So against better judgement, I did not immediately break up with my boyfriend. I tried convincing myself it was a one time thing, maybe he was just having a rough patch and I tried pushing it down. I did tell my brother what happened and he replied saying, he'd always thought my boyfriend and him were cool with each other at the very least. He then told me my boyfriend is being nuts and if I need to crash for a few days I could come on up to his end. 



So the rest of the week remained tense with my boyfriend but closer to the weekend, it was relaxed (ish) we went on a date, hung out with some friends at a bar together and yet for the life of me I couldn't figure out reasons for his outburst. 


So on Sunday I asked him again, now that you seem in a better mood, would it be so bad if I asked what was up last week? And once again mood went from friendly and relaxed to arctic. He simply asked me if I had to keep bringing up bullshit when we were doing okay again. 


I got pretty angry at him and told him to leave my apartment. Since Sunday I've been stewing and just looking back at our relationship, sure I have my friends, but we hang with them much less, the ones we do hang out with are more his friends and people that he is cool with being with. It was rough but looking back on it, I started seeing controlling behaviour from him that I'd never taken up on due to either just being head over heels and willing to compromise on everything and by compromise I mean roll over and give up.


We talked last night and I gave him an ultimatum, something I never expected to give in any relationship, either you sit and try to talk this out with me like a rational person, no bullshit answers and no dodging questions or we break up. Instead of having a conversation, he broke down and started telling me I was the best thing he's ever had and that he has issues that he can't even begin to explain and that he doesn't want to lose me.


Now, I'm sorry if this is the part that makes me seem like a bitch but it wasn't the answer I wanted or deserved, not when I'd been the one rolling over and giving him whatever throughout our entire relationship so I told him that it was best if we didn't see each other anymore and that he should leave my apartment. 



He left and spent almost 2 hours just sitting in his car in front my place before leaving when it was close to 12.


So, yeah, we broke up. I admit I feel more saddened than relieved so I'm hoping I don't do something stupid like drunk dial him or call him over because I'm lonely or something like that.


But yeah, we're not together anymore, it sucks but it had to be done.
