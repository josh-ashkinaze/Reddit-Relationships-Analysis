0,helpme55667788,[new],0,c7j7bb,2,"I?ve been dating my fiance for almost 5 years and its been great. However, I get this feeling that his sister in law doesnt like me and  I am not sure if I am over analyzing. 

Whenever she is around and I try to talk to her she gives me one word answers or just nods her head/shrugs her shoulders. I try to make conversation with her but we don?t really have much in common. She?s younger than me so it?s understandable. I am very girly and like makeup and shopping, and she?s more reserved and into anime. I first thought she was just shy but recently I have been thinking she might not like me.

For example, whenever I suggest something to do, she doesn?t feel like doing it. If my boyfriend suggests something else, she will always go for what he says. Like going out to eat food, she will say no to all my suggestions and go with his idea.

Whenever I ask her if she likes my outfit she will give me a weird look as say ?...yea its nice?. 

Once I i invited her out with my friends and my friends were trying to talk with her but she would either respond with a shrug/nod or not even answer at all. My friends were a little hurt about that. 

In the past, it has been clear to me that she doesn?t like my cooking. My boyfriend will always ask her if she likes my food and she?ll hesitate and shrug. So nowadays I?ll just invite her out to eat. Last time however, my fiance didn?t want to eat out (and I did) so she decided she wanted to stay in and eat at home. I cooked something that up, she took two bites and said she was full. It was clear she didnt like it so I offered to make her something else. She said she actually liked it but she was full. I later found that not too long after we ate, she ate a family bag of chips on her own. 

Whats confusing is that she constantly choses to hang with us. So I am not sure if its my anxiety that is fooling me or if something is up.

I really try to make her feel welcome, I know whats its like to be nervous around new people. However, I?ve known her for a few years and she won?t open up with me.

1,whyamilikethiiiiis,[new],2,c7j71c,3,"I'm a little conflicted about how I should or shouldn't be feeling right now. 


Partner and I were on a break and before coming back together and being intimate it was important for me to know if they had sex with anyone during that time. Simply because we don't use protection and I don't want to put myself at risk. They say no which is fine. I was either looking for a no or confirmation that they at least used protection. But, they decide to take it a step further and insist that they didn't speak to anyone, refused any and all advances, and have done nothing but sit at home. 


I know for a fact that's not true. Due to a shared account I know they actively pursued multiple people during that time. I only saw a small portion of time and removed myself from the account after seeing it. They don't know I've seen it and I don't want to throw it in their face. What they did during that time is literally none of my business, right? So, am I allowed to be mad about this because they lied or is what happened during that time not my business even if they lie about it? What I saw and the fact that they're lying about it makes me think there's way more than the small bit I saw.


Super confused right now.

2,chiminichanga,[new],4,c7j58x,3,"So, I?ve been with this guy for almost half a year. In the beginning I was the more distant one. I wasn?t even sure if I wanted a relationship. But after enough time, I started to fall for him hard. Now I?m at the point where I feel like I?m about to shrivel up and die every time he drives home (we only see each other for a few days out of the week due to distance). 

Is it normal to be pissed off and anxious when your partner is almost constantly using their smartphone? Even when they still give plenty of affection otherwise? Or to get such awful anxiety when their partner leaves them on read that they can?t sleep at night? Or to constantly want physical contact with them (always holding hands, playing with their hair). Or to immediately apologize even if you?re the one in the right (out of fear of losing them). I notice these characteristics in me and it?s awful. He just left a few hours ago and I feel like a shell of a person. I can?t leave my bed. But I?m about to cry because it smells like him. 

I recognize this behavior and it?s not something that I?m proud of. I want to fix it. I?ve always been so self motivated. And I?ve never fallen for someone this much. Not to mention, the fact that I notice my behavior makes it worse. Sometimes my neediness is a little obvious (even though I try to hide it), and I?m petrified that he will leave me because of it.

4,Justforfun9942,Dating,5,c7j3ow,2,"So hear me out. I noticed this being the case when I was either 11 or 12. I called it the 1 week curse. What it means is after meeting a girl, I have only 1 week. It will always fall apart under a week. I know what youre thinking. Obviously this is in your head. Well I thought so too. I've ignored it for the last year. Not even thinking about it but the same thing happens over and over and over again.

&#x200B;

I am now 26 years old. I really thought by now I would be with someone. I am in the exact same place as I was years and years and years ago. Every girl I ever meet ends in a week. For example no matter what happens something goes wrong. It never works out ever. I don't even get a good shot. I can meet girl, we could have the time of our life. Then next day shes gone. She doesn't respond much or anything. Or going on right now. This girl was super interested in me. We talked for 5+ hours straight after I got her number. We talked until 1 am when she had to go to sleep. I talked to her many times over a few months.  We had a date planned for yesterday but we had to reschedule. She asked if I can go today or next week. Well she stopped responding today and doesn't look like we are going. Funny part is that this time I didnt overly text her except for the first night. We barely texted between monday until the scheduled date which was yesterday. Tomorrow is the one week mark. But yeah what girl asks to go out tomorrow then ghosts you. Only happens to me.

&#x200B;

Thats one of many many examples. My roommate believes the curse is real with all my examples. When I say all of them. I have dozens and dozens of examples that all failed in under a week. The two that made it past a week were the most toxic unhealthy realtionships that ive ever been which has only been 2...they were both like the same person its creepy that I didnt notice.

8,CT_Elevation,Breakups,0,c7j0de,1,"I feel like there?s a lot of info to go into this so bear with me for a few paragraphs. 

My ex and I were together for about 6-7 months. She lives at home with her parents and her 2 year old child from a previous relationship. The biological dad was still in the picture and had her once or twice each week. Her mother has no job but instead takes care of the child while she is at work. She does this for free. 

The first 3 or so months were unbelievable. We were head over heels for each other. She was the nicest, sweetest, most caring person I had ever met. We never fought. If we had disagreements, we worked them out together. We began to talk about working towards a long term commitment with each other and having a family and such. Our work schedules conflicted with each other and our only free time seemed to be very late at night, so her parents would allow me to stay at their house freely so we could spend time together. She constantly told me how happy she was with me.

Around this time, I began to have a lot of interaction with her child. I asked her what level of interaction she wanted me to have in raising her because i didn?t want to overstep. She told me I was the best father figure her kid had in her life and wanted me to raise her like she was my own. So I did just that. 

I had noticed a couple of things that had me a bit concerned with the way my ex and her parents interacted with the child. They were afraid to tell her ?no? which resulted in a lot of temper tantrums, in which they would immediately give her what she was wanting. They kept her up very late (past 11:00/midnight) regularly. And her diet was not great. A good amount of soda, candy, and things like that (often given by my ex?s mother). 

My ex and I tackled the tantrum things head on and they worked perfectly very quickly. The tantrums rarely happened around me if ever. However, the mother of my ex was not pleased with my level of involvement and the changes that were being made. When my ex spoke to her about what we were aiming to do, I was no longer allowed to stay with them. The invites to come over for dinner or go to outings stopped. If I did come around, they made no conversation with me even if I tried to initiate it. It made it very difficult to come around and therefore, my ex and I saw each other less. 

When this began to happen, I developed anxiety and even went into a bit of a depression. I couldn?t understand why things were the way they were and I felt like I was eventually going to lose her and her daughter. I was constantly worried she was going to leave me. I would voice my worry to her and she was always VERY confronting and supportive. She constantly reassured me that we would get through this and things would eventually get back to how they used to be. 

One thing we did clash about a few times was her financials. She was not someone who saved and essentially spent every bit of what she earned, very opposite of me. She had talked to me about how she wanted to eventually be out of her house and someday move in with me. There were multiple times she stated she had no money in her bank account. From January to May, she had spent around $10,000 total. I came down hard on her a bit but not long after, we sat down and had a good talk about all of it. She said she knew she was struggling and wanted help. We worked through it and promised we would handle all of our problems by sitting down and talking them out like we had just done. 

The next few days were seemingly normal. She was very loving and reassuring that everything was going to be great. That she loved me and wanted to be with me. We had plans one night to spend an evening together. She asked me to cook for her, and when she got there all seemed perfectly normal. Then suddenly, she told me she wasn?t happy anymore. I was completely shocked and thrown off guard. We didn?t have much of a conversation that night about it. We said let?s give it a day or two and talk about it later. 

That conversation never came. She initially said it was too hard to face me. Then she gave me times we would talk but would avoid them when the time came up. Then eventually she just became very rude and said a couple of pretty hurtful things. She went on to block me on all social media and such, was going out with guys within about two weeks and doing things she had told me during our relationship that she didn?t want to do. And really just seemed to start seeking attention from guys. We saw each other in person once and she COMPLETELY erupted on me saying she didn?t want to see me or talk to me again. A side of her I had never seen anything remotely close to. 

I at one point after the breakup had a conversation with the mother and she pointed out these various things that i had done in the relationship that made my ex unhappy. I remembered many of those specifics and the ex had told me it was what she wanted, and some of them were things she was actually very upset that the mother did not want them as well. 

So basically, I?m completely confused. I have no idea what happened to cause any of this. I can?t seem to move on as I?m just stuck wondering what happened and what she thinks she?ll get from someone else that is better than me. I really was doing everything I could to give her the best life possible. And I wonder how much of this was caused by the parents or by a simple fear of things not working out. And I wonder if all of her actions of avoiding me and pushing me away were because she was trying to make it easier on herself by concealing her feelings. I?m still in love with her and I feel like it?s just making me worse and worse, but at the same time I don?t want to let go. 

I don?t even know what advice I?m hoping to get. I guess just input on what may have happened and what I?m supposed to do now.

10,amibeingdramatic5,[new],2,c7iwj0,1,"
Hi everyone!  Straight to the point. My husband (26M) & I (24F) have been married for little over 3 years now but have been doing long distance for a while due to various reasons but now we are back living together for good. 

When we first started dating, we would have sex 3-4x a day everyday for the few days we were together before one of us going back to our home country. Sometimes even more & one time we have sex 7x in one day. So yeah, we both have a very high sex drive. 

When we have lived together, it has decreased to once a day, but still everyday. It?s always been that way. We have a routine where we shower together every night, then sex, then sleep. If for some reason, we would skip a day, the next day we would playfully say ?You owe me the one from yesterday? & we would do it once more. 

So 2 nights ago, we had sex as always. Last night, he had to go to sleep early cause he had to get up early today but he looked at the clock & said ?we still got enough time to do it?, and so we did it. 

Nothing felt different to me, I still enjoyed it as always but after we were done, he said ?okay we are going to take a break for the next couple of days?. I was confused & asked why & he said ?We don?t have to do it everyday when we live together. That?s just when we are doing long distance so that we can do it as much as we can before one of us leaves?. 

So I told him that when we have lived together in the past, we would still do it everyday. He said ?It just feels repetitive now, it feels a lot more powerful when we wait a couple of days & then do it again?. So I figured something went wrong during sex last night that made him change his mind. He said nothing went wrong but it just feels better that way. 

I want input from both men & women. Am I overreacting? I?m not gonna lie, my first thought was that he was gonna be with someone else for those ?couple of days? (yeah I know I?m insecure) but then when he said ?repetitive? I felt like I?m not good enough. Like he feels it?s always the same. I?m not very experienced tbh. He?s the second man I?ve ever been with but I always try my very best to please him & I thought I was doing a ?good job?. It?s not a ?job? cause I actually enjoy doing it & he pleases me too. 

How often is it normal to have sex when living together? Am I overthinking this? What could be the actual reason for him to say this or feel this way? 

Any comments/thoughts are appreciated!

12,PhoenixFeather1994,[new],5,c7iw90,2,"My boyfriend and I are in an amazing relationship and have been going out for a year. I just officially moved in with him (moved all of my clothes in), but over the past several months I started slowly moving things in one by one. Prior to moving in, we've talked about everything you can think of: marriage, kids, chores, finances, where we want to live in the future, what we want our lifestyles to be like in the future, dogs, etc. We are on the same page with all of this and it is amazing. He mortgages a condo and that is where we live. We decided to divide up household expenses (mortgage, utilities) proportionally based on how much we earn. So, I will pay 400 a month. We have decided that I will start paying 400 a month in September (he wants me to save up as much as possible since I am a grad student, and only earn a stipend). For July and August I will pay half of that (200 a month). Anyways, I guess that info isn't really important, but we have discussed all of the important things and agreed upon everything.

&#x200B;

First question is, do you think most people would view 1 year as ""too soon"" to move in?

&#x200B;

Second question is about his family. Neither me nor my boyfriend are religious. We're agnostic / atheist. His family is very Christian. They're SUPER nice people though and I don't want to overstep boundaries with them or make them not like me. They're very liberal Christians. They have liberal views on a lot of topics. Neither of us are sure about how they would feel about us moving in together. Although we're both pretty sure they will be fine with it. My family knows I live with him (they kind of have to, since I moved out from their house to live with him lol) but his family doesn't know. He said he will tell them within a couple months, but told me today that he was thinking more about it and will tell them ""soon"". 8 months ago, with my support and me sitting beside him, he texted his mom telling her that he is not religious anymore and hasn't been for nearly 10 years. His family lives 5 minutes from him but he felt more comfortable doing this over text.  His mom sent him a long text back that sounded super supportive. She said her and his dad are ""a bit sad"" but they understand that this is a decision that people need to make for themselves. She also mentioned that she hopes to sit down with him and understand more of his views, but that hasn't happened yet lol. Anyways, since that text, nothing has changed and they all went on with life as usual. They are very understanding people. But I am very scared that when he tells them, they will convince him to make me move out. Although he is the sweetest guy on the planet, he doesn't have a  backbone so I am afraid he may comply (even though he says he definitely wouldn't). I am also afraid that when his parents find out, they will stop liking me or think I forced him into doing this. What's the best way to bring this up to his family? He will obviously do it, but I can give him some suggestions. If it makes a difference, when I lived with my parents I lived 50 minutes away from him and it was a hastle driving 100 minutes everyday to see him.

Me f(25) met m(24) around Memorial Day which was our first date. I?m one of those who likes to take initiative on dates if I see they?re going well. After that, things were progressing so fast and everything was so amazing. He treated me like no other guy has ever treated me with respect and was everything I was looking for. It was pretty much a fairytale.

Three or four dates later (we spent almost every day and weekend together) he met all my friends at my birthday party. He was so nice and did everything to impress everyone and it was great. I said the L word first (I know I know), but he also said it right back. 

We had sex on my birthday and twice after and it was all amazing.

He finally had a weekend to himself to think and process everything and started becoming unsure about it all. He picked me up after work on Monday and asked about how I was doing even though I could see right through the texts and I knew what was coming. He had my stuff in the back of the car, but I had to drag out of him to say actually to break up/cut it off. I?m not sure he did it because of some external force, someone else is in the picture, or he?s just not ready for a relationship. I guess I?m just not sure why people do this and I?m so crushed.

The guy responded ?don?t be mad at me for your dumb decisions and that you?re dating someone who doesn?t really care about you then called me and my boyfriend miserable and he said we had a fake relationship? 

After that verbal altercation I got wrote up at work for profanity and verbal fighting with a coworker.

Ever since that day my boyfriend has barely spoken to me. We discussed what happened and i told my boyfriend that i was going to fuss out the next person who came up to me worrying about our relationship. My boyfriend seemed upset about it and he hasn?t talked to me since the day this happened

15,allisong124,[new],12,c7ir1o,5,"Husband(34) with Me(33)
I'm reaching out for alternate views and advice. We have been together for 6 years, 5 kids and otherwise great relationship. Husband(34) works 6-7 days a week currently and gets stressed about job(even though he loves his job) Me(34) am a SAHM and also homeschool.
The issue. At least 1x a month, sometimes more and I suppose sometimes less, he will (what I call) ""check out"". He will disappear for hours at a time. Previously I would panic, thinking he had been in an accident, so he finally agreed to an app where we can track where each other is. 
Well, he will go AWOL. Not answer calls, messages ect. At times he is ""on his way home"" (30 min drive) but not get home until 10p-1am. Or when he has to run an errand for work, he will spend 3 hours in meijer(no joke) and most of the time not even buy anything. 

This usually happens when he's stressed, and I feel like it's his way to cope, but it hurts me non the less. He does not seem to care anymore. I wrote him an email describing how this has been making me feel. He said he was glad I wrote it and would write me back. He hasn't. 


Well, it happened again yesterday. This time his GPS was off (which is a fun new thing that sometimes accompanies the checking out)so I had no way to know where he was.I talked with him around noon, all was fine. Then nothing. I called him, messaged him, and even called his place of work. He was not there. He finally returned my texts around 6pm with ""I'll he home as soon as I can"" then nothing. 

Reasons it makes me sad/pisses me off.
 1.We have kids that love him and want to see him.
2. I never know if he will be joining is for dinner, or helping with bedtime routines or getting them to bed. The question ""when is Daddy going  to be home?"" is hard to answer when I HAVE NO CLUE. 
3.I also find I have far less patience with my kids when I'm frustrated about this. It makes me less of a parent. 
4. He chooses to be away from me when he is stressed about something, instead of confiding in me.
5. He has never genuinely apologized. I don't think he thinks he needs to.
6. I'm home all day with kids. I need him .

I'm beginning to think I am crazy and this shouldn't be an issue. He acts like everything is fine. Is it normal for husbands to ignore their spouses for hours at a time? Any advice is appreciated.

16,xandraarche,[new],3,c7iqj2,1,"This will be long, my apologies. 

Things were great at the beginning, I could see a future with him then, but now that I?m living with him I guess I got to know him a bit more and I feel bad cause he?s been talking about long term goals, but I?ve been thinking about breaking up with him over the littlest things.

I must be fed up with everything for me to feel this way. A little background on him, he has a full time job, likes to smoke weed, and he skates A LOT. It?s his passion, and he?s won a few competitions in skateboarding. If he has the day off, his go to is skating. Even if the house looks like a mess, and there?s a lot of chores to do, he still chooses to skate and I?m okay with that. I keep telling myself that it?s better than being out late partying or whatever. But sometimes when he has 2 days off, all he does is skate and when he comes home sore and tired of course I?m not gonna be like ?hey just so you know, there?s chores to do.? So I just let him pass out. It would be nice if he could allocate one day to skate his legs off, and the other day to help with chores. 

He doesn?t even pay attention to what I say sometimes, like I get excited when he gets home cause I can finally tell him about my day and whatever. But he?s always on instagram and it?s like he zones in and he always asks me to repeat himself cause he wasn?t listening the first time, which I guess he could tell that I got annoyed with cause when he asks me I just say never mind, so now he pays attention. 

He also owns 5 pets?animals that shed, knock stuff off the table, and have a few accidents here and there. So it?s very hard for me to keep up with cleaning, just imagine there?s 2 people making a mess (myself and him) all 5 of his animals, and my puppy who I?m still potty training. I talked to him about this already and he was good especially in the winter when he cant really skate all day everyday, but now that it?s summertime it?s back to the way it was. 

Also, he gets very explosive with the littlest things. The other day he was throwing stuff around in the kitchen just because he got frustrated cause I put the fork in the dish rack and it got stuck. He was swearing so much and making so much noise with the dishes that I had to take my puppy upstairs (we live in a basement suite and I rent a bedroom upstairs which serves as my office/closet) and stayed there until he left to go see a doctor about a bruise. He never directs his anger towards me though. He?s always apologetic after freaking out but I keep telling him that as long as he doesn?t direct his anger towards me, we?re okay. But I guess now I?m regretting that cause it?s starting to rub off on me and I?ve worked so hard to eliminate anger and hatred out of my system and he?s bringing me all those negative vibes back. 

When he freaked out the other day he texted me saying sorry for freaking out and that it was because he was stressed out. I wanted to respond ?what tf are you stressed out about?! Your fuckin bruise from skating?! You have a roof over your head, food on your table when you get home cause I make sure you always have food to eat after skating, all these animals that love you, a good girlfriend, a stable job, and no debt. Tell me what the fuck you?re stressed about!!? But of course, I reread it and I felt like that?s exactly what the old me would say, and it felt wrong to invalidate his stress so I deleted all of it and went on to say ?thanks for making breakfast. Let me know how it goes at the doctors.? 

It cant be this way anymore, I have a full time job and school (which I?m now questioning enrolling again btw because idk how I?ll find time to cook and clean and do the laundry?yes I do all of it!) and a puppy to take care of. 


So with all that being said, concerns such as me feeling like I?m not getting enough attention, sex being almost non existent because he?s always tired, and feeling like I should just break up with him, arise. He always talks about getting married, buying a house together (which we?re set to do in 2021 btw) and having kids. And when I think about having kids with him, I begin to imagine what would happen if he freaked out in front of my kids. I grew up in a peaceful and non-violent home, and I want that for my future kids too. We have talked about it before though, we went to a party where there were 2 kids and people were just dropping F-bombs everywhere. On the ride home I told him ?that?s really weird and new to me. When I have kids, anyone that drops the F-bomb in front of them will get kicked out of my house immediately.? He agreed with it and laughed, so I said ?that goes for you too.? And he goes ?well yeah of course.? But that?s about it. I want to have a talk with him more specifically about it though, like it?s not just the cursing or whatever. If he wants kids with me he?s gonna have to learn to repress his urge to yell and throw stuff around. 

I?m not gonna sit here and be like ?everything else is great and I love him? because it?s not. He doesnt initiate dates anymore, literally goes to work, comes home, either skates and then comes home tired, or just passes out. I?m not exactly sure if I still love him honestly. If I?m willing to break up with him anytime I don?t think that that?s love. 

And if we break up, I don?t know if he?ll let me continue renting the upstairs bedroom anymore and it?ll be hard for me to look for another place, move, and it won?t be as cheap as where I?m renting now for sure. Although I will move if it is necessary. 


Sorry that was a very long post. I know the solution to my problems is to talk to him and take it from there, but I just needed to vent. Anyone ever have the same issues here? Did you talk about it and how did it go? We?ve been together for 2 years now and we?ve never had to talk about anything major like this so it?ll be a first.

Hi, I've changed our ages a bit because I'm unsure if he reddits or not but I could use some advice and input about my current situation. I would greatly appreciate it actually.

I was with this amazing guy, I mean just all around amazing; he has a kind heart, we have the exact humor and I would laugh until my ribs hurt all the time, hes compassionate about my insecurities, etc.

Hes been going through some personal issues, and this lead to him telling me he loved me very much but he wasnt ready for a girlfriend right now. I was blindsided and very hurt, I cried an embarassing amount but he insisted on holding me and consoling me, he even continued to kiss my head and cheeks. 

He told me that it 100% had nothing to do with me and that he still has feelings for me, and for right now wanted to be my friend until he was ready. He said he wanted to be together again but my confidence is shot at the moment so I'm scared I'll be waiting to be hurt again (even though I'm proud he came to this decision and I know he wasnt intentionally trying to hurt me). I'm worried he'll just want someone else when hes ready or he'll stop loving me. 

He has reassured me he meant what he said, and theres small things that make me feel better like seeing hes displaying art I made for him or checking in on me. But, I'm still so unsure, is it idiotic for me to wait?",1561924166.0,Am I waiting to get hurt again eventually? (23m) (20f),1.0
18,poorunfortunatesoul4,[new],1,c7ine6,1,"I'll try to make this as short as I can, but there's a lot of backstory here and I really need to let it all out.

Before you start reading, I apologize for my bad english, it's not my first language.

So, everything started back in 2015: I just graduated from University and moved to another city in search of a job. I had also just ended a complicated relationship with a guy I was smart enough to dump after less than a month, because of his controlling behaviour. I was pretty hurt, still.

One day, completely out of the blue, I receive a FB message from D, a close friend of one of my best friends (A.) who lives in the city i had just left. He was clearly flirting with me and since he is a cute guy and I was looking for some fun, I led him on. We started talking on skype for hours every day, he would play lullabies on the piano until I fell asleep and even composed some songs just for my hears to hear (he's an excellent pianist). Long story short, we start seeing each other during the weekends, but I made it clear that I didn't want to commit or start anything serious since I wanted to focus on my job search and my new life in the new city. After less than a couple of months, he literally comes to my house with some empty boxes, fills them with my stuff and helps me move back to my city of origin, because he wanted me to live with him, in his house. He said he loved me and that he would have help me find a path in my life.

I know it may sound a pretty naive and dumb thing for me to do, but in his ""defense"" I was miserable in the new city: my ""ex"" basically stalked me everyday and I couldn't find a decent job. Also, I was living in a house with 4 dudes who were dirty, loud and annoying.

He asks me to be his girlfriend and I say yes. I even asked our mutual friend A. if D. was a guy I could trust and A. said he was the best guy I could ever find and that I was so lucky to have him by my side. And I really felt this way, lucky. Dumb me. I move into his house, which was pretty close to my parents house and start living a fairytale. We were happy to spend everyday together (he was a student at the time and played in a band, I was job searching so we had plenty of time). I often went to visit my parents, since it was so close to ""my"" new house and sometimes I spent the night there. Big mistake.

Some months later, my dad gets sick and dies of cancer. All happened in less than two months. My family and I were broken (and broke). I decide to put aside my dreams and to take my father's job (he was an estate manager, which is a really hard job that has NOTHING to do with everything i've ever done in my life before). I had to learn EVERYTHING, take lots of responsibilities and deal with some really hard stuff. It's not an easy job, especially for a young girl (I was 24) and even today it's hard for me to make people respect me, because I look younger and I AM A GIRL (yes, in Italy it's still an issue). I can't even count the times I was sexually harassed at work.

In all of this, D. was with me. He helped me deal with that stuff, he helped me through the grieving process and I felt, again, so lucky to have him with me.

Given this situation, I started spending more time at my parent's house and D. started a job as a sales assistant in a music store. We still saw each other pretty often, but not as much as before.

As the months went by, I start noticing that... he doesn't want to have sex (almost) at all. He said that it was stressed because of the new job and the band, but I couldn't help but find it ""odd"". We had sex like once a month and it was starting to frustrate me.

Also, his house was a fucking mess: used napkins all over the floor, rotten food in the kitchen, he never changed the sheets and seemed to live happily in his dumpster.

One day, I come across some text messages he sent to a girl I did not know. In the messages, he invited her over in the middle of the night. You can imagine how mad I was. I confront him, he says they only kissed because I immediately felt guilty and sent her back home. Of course I didn't believe it. He cried, stopped eating, said he would have killed himself and other stuff like this.

I was broken, again.

We break up and after 3-4 weeks, we decide to try again. After all, it was just one mistake in two years of relationship and he was a good guy. Always supporting, always there when I needed him.

Dumb me, again.

Long story short, last August, I find out that he had ALWAYS been cheating on me. I'll skip the details on how I found out, but basically he started seeing this girl (the girl of the texts) like 6 days after we started dating. And never stopped. They saw each other like once every month or two, while I was away. I later found out that this girl wasn't the only one. As far as I know, he cheated on me with 3 different girls, one of them was a friend of mine (we'll call her R). I also find out that a lot of people knew that but never said a word to me.

Everything collapsed. He cried, begged, promised he loved me and only me and that wasn't important, was something he was doing just for fun etc etc.

I packed my bags and left that house for good.

He started seeing a therapist but I don't know anything else about him. I don't lurk his social media, nor I ask anyone because I really don't care.I tried to confront him at the time, but it was disarming. It was like talking to a puppet. He doesn't defend himself (how could he?), he just nods and admits he's a total shit. He even said that he started going to therapy to understand WHY he ruined the most precious thing he's ever had (our relationship) and that, someday, he would give me some answers. Needless to say, i'm still waiting.

I'll never know how or why he did such a horrible thing to the girl he swears to love with all his heart and, above all, I'll never get over the fact that he kept doing this while I was going through hell when my father died.

After a month, my dog of 16 years died.

At that point, I had no tears left. I tried to commit suicide, nobody cared. For some reason, A (our mutual friend who claimed he didn't know anything about D's behaviour) decided to be his friend and stopped talking to me.

Last weekend, I saw D. at a party. He was clearly embarrassed but in no time he started laughing (REALLY loud) and having fun with the other guests. Then he started talking to R (one of the girls he fucked while he was with me who was also at the party) about his one night stands and the girls he fucked in his miserable life. I don't know WHY he decided it was an acceptable thing to do at a party where everyone knows what he did and, more important, where I was one of the guests. I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? What have I done to deserve this?

I am beyond tears. I haven't shed one since my dog's death and it's almost been a year since everything happened. I don't trust anyone anymore, I literally have panic attacks everytime someone asks me out or tries to be kind with me. I push everyone away. I'm scared, I'm broken and I don't know what to do. 

Ps: if something isn't clear, feel free to ask.

\*\*TL;DR; : After 3 years of relationship, I found out that my ex had been cheating on me basically since day 1 with at least 3 girls and I had no clue.

Ok, so I am sorry if this turns into more of a rambling/rant but I just have to get this off my chest at some point.  
Throwaway because both my SO and her friends know my Reddit Username.

A  bit of backstory. I met my now SO when I was in my hometown for summer  break. We hit it off, started dating 3 months later and had a very good,  stable relationship for over two years now. She is the greatest person I've  ever met and we are wonderfully compatible.

Her friends however...might be among the worst people I ever had the displeasure of meeting.

I  had a job about 500km away from my hometown and during that time I only  had little time to interact with her general friendgroup, but I knew  the two girls she hung out with very regularly. She goes to the same  University as them and basically sees and talks to them every day. But  they generally seemed fairly nice, if a bit...juvenile. Both of them  have never been more than 20km from their parents house for prolonged  periods of time. They lack life experience and had a slightly naive  worldview. But we got along well enough.

About  a year ago however, I was able to relocate back to my hometown with my  job and was able to spend a lot more time with my SO...and her  friendgroup.

It took only a few weeks before I was regularly invited to meetups, pub  crawls and other activities that we did together as a group. And it only  took me a few of those meetups to realize that over the coure of an  evening my SO's friends only had one topic that they liked to discuss:  Race.

Which skin colour is the right one, which the wrong. Which minorities should be considerd ""countrymen"", and which should have their human rights removed.

Bit of a warning, I do not want to make this political. This is not about  right or wrong political opinions but about basic human decency.

I was reviled the first time I heard that talk but it took two distinct  events for me to put my foot down. The first one was that one of her  friends was very much onboard with putting Jewish people back into  concentration camps because it had ""a great impact on our economy, not  because she is an antisemite"" (we are all german except my SO, so that  is a double yikes), the other was their very outspoken opinion that I  was part of the problem in why our country is going downhill because I  have the wrong skin colour (once again, gonna omit what that is to not  make anything political).

Both of these things happened over the course of a single evening and  resulted in me nuking that bridge from orbit. The fact that anyone could  associate me with any of these girls makes me wanna wretch.

That was almost six months ago. I haven't heard or seen them since then  (thank god) but my SO has still very much kept them around as her  friends. My issue is that, especially because of our conflicting  schedules and us both being strapped for time generally, she still sees  them almost daily.

And  the fact that I know that my SO takes advice from them very seriously  as well as them both actively detesting me because of my skin colour  makes me fear that they might have or at some point will have a negative  influence on our relationship.

I  have told to my SO about this when I nuked that bridge and she has  assured me that she ""only has a surface level friendship"" with the two  girls and that she neither shares any of their ""political"" opinions nor  that she cares for their relationship advice but I have also seen evidence to the contrary.

Am I questioning things too much and driving myself insane? Or is there anything I should do about this?

&#x200B;

TL;DR:  
My SO's two best friends that she spends a lot of time with are horrible people that hate me and I don't know how to deal with it and or if there are any actions I can take to improve the situation.

23,ScrantonStranger,[new],3,c7ij96,2,"So my boyfriend of 4 years and I broke up recently because of long distance (we did this one year long distance and it was tough). The break up was really amicable, we're really close to each other and care about each other so we still talk and it's great. We of course talked about seeing other people and he told me not to tell him if I was seeing anyone. I told him he should tell me if he was seeing anyone because I'd want to know.

In my head, this a long break. I love him and I really want to spend my life with him, it was just the situation making us go crazy. In a few years when we're both done with our grad schools we can revisit this topic, and I know he feels the same way.

Last night he told me he has gotten really close to one of his friends. This is a friend he made very recently so I don't know her, but from what I've heard about her from literally everyone in my group is that she's really nice and sweet. She had a boyfriend but wanted to get out of that relationship and she finally broke up with him. Anyway, things happened between these two but she said she does not want to date him because it'll create tensions in the group. He then told her he can't keep doing this because one or both of them will develop feelings (he thinks she already has feelings for him) and he doesn't want just a FWB. She knows about me and that we're both in love with each other and want to end up together.

The only thing that's bothering me about all this is that he actually likes her. What if he falls in love with her and completely moves on? And forgets about me? Am I being too selfish even thinking about this? He has told me I come first and when there's a chance for us to be together we're going to be and nobody else matters, and has apparently told her this too, but it's not too crazy to think he'll fall for her.

I have gone out with a couple of guys I met online since the breakup, but he asked me to not tell him about them so I haven't. He just knows I'm seeing people. But I've made it a point to make it clear to these guys that I do not want to date them, that I'm in love with my ex boyfriend and I don't want anything serious with anyone else.

I don't completely understand how I feel about it. If he had started going out with someone he barely knew and only found attractive I would have been okay with that I think. This girl is not attractive at all (sorry if it's rude) so I know he actually likes her. And he even told me this that he can't just have a fling with someone he doesn't have feelings for. Which means he has feelings for her. What am I supposed to do?

His relationship with his parents has always been rocky. In my opinion they have been abusive to him and engaged in the following actions:

- Belittling him for what he wears, eats, and does

- Constantly comparing him to others and saying ?why can?t you be more like *insert name here*?

- Using money to blackmail and control him

- Making rude remarks about my family

- Sending mixed signals constantly

- Calling him names like ?fat? (he is not fat in the slightest, not even chubby!) 

That?s all I can think of right now, but there was more and it got so nasty.

My partner has only ever been polite and fair to them. He tried so hard to maintain a relationship with them, but he got so depressed and it started affecting him and he got migraines and threw up due to the stress they were causing.

Just over a year ago he cut contact.


Where we?re at now:

My partner has been so much happier since cutting contact and is really successful. But his Gran has told him that his Dad now has cancer and he is starting treatment. His Gran has tried blackmailing him to get in touch again but my partner has so far refused.

He is now facing the dilemma of whether to wish his father good luck for treatment via email. He does NOT want a relationship with them, but I think he?s stuck on whether to be kind and not have any regrets either way.

25,Askicia,[new],4,c7igsl,0,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for 4 years. Our relationship would be perfect if it wasn't for one thing. He's not sexually attracted to me. We both love each other very much. Our relationship is healthy because we are great at communicating and our trust in each other is solid. I've never met anyone so similar to me in all aspects. Our sex is great too, I am completely attracted to him however he can't get turned on solely by me - I need to roleplay for him. If I don't roleplay, he thinks about other women instead. Objectively, I'm average looking. My boyfriend thinks I'm pretty but I'm not his type. It makes me upset and he knows it but we can't exactly force him to be attracted to me. I don't want to lose the greatest relationship I've ever had but I believe he deserves to be with someone who is his type where he can have better sex without needing to use his imagination or ask me to roleplay and I deserve to be with someone who makes me feel attractive and special in bed. We always thought we would get married soon in the future but I have a feeling that this particular problem will bite us in the long term.

This is sort of an updated ask on my first ask about wanting to talk to my ex boyfriend less. To make a long story short, we were together for several years and mostly amicably broke up around a year ago. We had always promised to be best friends no matter what, but now I don?t think i?m sure I want to. 

I had originally made an ask saying how I wanted to speak to him less, as we have been talking every day on Snapchat. We lead very different lives now and I don?t find us combatible even as friends. He?s off in a big city as an intern and parties very hard on the weekends, and i?m a laid back camp counselor. I do my fair share of socializing and going out on the town for sure, but I don?t like to go crazy. The majority of my friends are like me and my more party oriented friends don?t act like him at all. I hate to admit it too, but talking to him feels like a chore/obligation because I don?t want to hurt him any more than I have (as I initiated the breakup). After the breakup as well, he was very nasty to me during a very stressful week at school and egged me on to make me feel upset when I had been supportive to him and a good friend all along after we broke up. When I myself was a little more upset about our breakup (a month or so later) he seemed to patronize me and almost brag about how my breaking up with him was the best thing to ever happen to him. It?s not been the smoothest post breakup despite promising if anything happened to our relationship, that we would always be best friends. For the whole of our relationship, we were best friends too.

So far, I?ve been only responding about twice a day in hopes he would take the hint and stop talking to me altogether because these days, I?ve just been finding his lifestyle and partying habits to be really, really trashy and hard to watch/to hear about. He drinks all the time it seems like (and that?s been a problem since we broke up) and last night, I found out he almost got arrested for public urination. That was last straw for me. He?s not the friend I enjoyed being with.

I would be lying if I said I didn?t care about him as a person, as we practically grew up together. I?m not still romantically or physically attracted to him at all. I just hate to see my friend go down this road. I?ve tried numerous times to encourage him to maybe lay off a bit or get some help, but he either refuses to or talks a good fight but never follows through. For my own mental health, I desperately need space. I just don?t want him to think it?s because i?m still into him like that.

I just want to find the kindest words to say that I don?t want to be friends anymore. Any advice? I don?t want to be hurtful but I need to think about me too.

TL;DR: one of my good friends (who also is my ex boyfriend) has been acting really trashy these days. I don?t find us to be compatible friends at all, as we lead very different lives.

She calls one day after that and tells me about this co-worker she has a crush on and who asked her out but she said no because of our relationship.

I met this girl about 3 weeks and we've hit it off insanely hard. Like I've never clicked with anyone so fast.

We've chilled 4 times since we met, 2 of which weren't dates since we met from mutual friends and were just chilling. On the 3rd time it turns out we both felt ways about each other so it turned into a mini date. Date 2 we both knew what was going on. Had an amazing night together. 

Later on in the night we were sitting by the water and making out. She broke the kiss at one point and says she really wish she met me at a different time. I asked why and she said she just got out of a 2 year relationship a few days before the 3rd time we hung out and she doesn't want me to only be a rebound. She asked me what I thought. I told her I'm going along with whatever might happen and we shouldn't force anything, be it towards a relationship or away from each other out of fear. Said we should just let things happen naturally and we'll know what's right for us as we see each other more. She agreed and the mood went back to how it was beforehand. Rest of the night went great, she fed me a shitload of compliments and said we absolutely have to hang out again.

So, I'm not 100% sure how to take the rebound comment. I'm taking it as she was dropping hints she may want a relationship and wants to chill until she feels ready for something and not rush into it. A few of my friends feel she's trying to say she's not interested. Some others are saying she was just shit testing me to see how I'd react to the thought of her just wanting sex from me.

I just got back from a 3 day long bachelor party in Las Vegas and I'm trying to figure out why my future father in law is so angry about the situation. 

I'm going to call Future Father in Law FFIL throughout the post.

The party was planned with a couple friends from High school and college. We planned around going to Las Vegas, gambling, drinking, clubbing, the whole 9 yards.

I posted a daily update at the end of each day on social media to celebrate how awesome my friends are and how memorable the trip has been. The first day FFIL posts a passive aggressive comment on my post of ""why are you in Vegas?"" And ""thanks for the invite ???"". I ignore him.

Day 2 comes and I do it again and he posts ""???"" all over my posts. I just ignore him.

Day 3 comes and I'm playing blackjack in a casino when I receive this exact message ""you might not have been the one who organized the bachelor party, but I should have been invited. I probably would have not been able to attend, but I should have been given the opportunity to go."" 

Mind you I had been drinking, I was in a casino and I didn't want to deal with it, but I didn't want to ignore him either so I responded ""I'd be happy to talk about it when I get home if you want. Let me know.""

FFIL also responded with ""Not scoring a lot of points with me lately. I feel a bit disrespected twice now. You don't have the decency to even talk to me about your intent to marry my daughter. I approve, but you should have at least let me know you were going to propose to her.""

That last point was had a long conversation we had months ago and I had thought we came to a mutual understanding that I just am not traditional like that. Desperate the that he felt the need to bring it up again.

Day 3 of the party is over in which I reported I actually made over $400 in the casino, and FFIL passive aggressive comments continue.

Now that I'm home my open invitation to talk to me is still open to him but he hasn't taken my up on it. He's been silent since I've offered to resolve this face to face.

Not really sure what to do at this point. Do I wait for him to talk to me, or do I reach out to him? What should I say/do?

32,AnoniemeGebruiker,Personal issues,5,c7i7ui,0," 

Let's start by telling you about me. I'm 18 years old, attending a dutch highschool and I am a pretty big nerd if I say so myself. I'm dyslexic and not a native english speaker (so I'm incredibly sorry for any language mistakes). I'm fat. Not obese or anything, but just fat. I've been fat for as long as I can remember and I am losing weight, but it's a long process (I'm sure most of us can relate).

I take a long time to feel comfortable somewhere/with somebody. Last year, I could finally give an answer in class to a teachers question without feeling my hearth pounding in my chest. I was always afraid of having the wrong answer or making a fool of myself, but lately this has been at an all time minimum, and I'm really happy about that! However, it took me 3 years to feel comfortable enough to speak with those people. Every time I'm somewhere new I get anxious. I don't feel like i belong there and just really want to go home. I feel like I can screw up big time when talking to people I've met 2 years ago.

I've been dealing with this since forever. Mostly i could cope with this pretty well by sticking to the friends I've had since my childhood. The one time I really needed to meet new people was when I started highschool, I managed by getting friends with the other non-popular/not-talking people in my class. Honestly, they are amazing people and literally spend all of my time with them. But even with them it took about a year for me to be comfortable with them.

I often doubted wether I've got autism or not. But when they did a dyslexia test, I was also tested for autism, and a variety of similair things (standard procedure). A coupple of the friends that I did talk to about this thought I might be gifted (as in highly inteligent, I'm unsure if ""gifted"" is the right translation). And altough my grades are really high, I know a kid that is gifted, and I'm not even close as troubled as he is (and ""having good grades"" is very different from being gifted).

Yesterday, I was at a party. I was invited by ""friends of friends"". All the friends I've made since highschool are basically friends of my original friends in highschool. One of these is a girl, let's call here ""L"". L is 17 y/o.

I've had a bit of a crush on her for the past year, but decided to never act on it. She always seemed very close to another friend of ours, let's call him ""M"". So to me, It always seemed Like M and L were in love. I didn't want to make it akward between any of us. But, I talked to M a coupple weeks ago and he told me he wasn't romantically involved with her and that he ""loves her like a sister"".

So at this party, L got a bit tipsy. She asked me to dance with her, and so I did. It was great fun! After she had some more drinks she really did get drunk. I felt like she couldn't get home by herself because the road she needed to cycles is very dangerous for drunk people (there have been a lot of drownings). So i asked M to keep an eye on her and take her home ( I couldn't stay at the party to take her home myself, I swear I would have if I could and I swear I will in the future).

So the party started at 9.00PM and I needed to get home by 01.30AM. I had been dancing with her this entire time, had been joking with her and just being togheter with her (in a spatial sense). I was very comfortable this entire time, however after this party, I've been back to being 100% uncomfortable with her. I've never been this frightened to make a mistake. Next year, she's going to a different class, I will surely still see her during breaks, but I'm afraid she will get into a relationship with someone else. So I feel like I should tell her how I feel asap. I just need to find a fitting moment. But i'm frightened. I'm afraid I'll make it incredibly weird between her and the entire group.

So, I would like your thoughts/advice on 2 things.

\-Do you think I have a mental problem (autism, gifted or something I've never heard of)?

\-What do you think are the possible consequences of me telling her I like her?

Thank you in advace! I'm aware this post might have been hard to follow, because I myself am just unsure about what this is / what i want.

34,GullibleSeagull,[new],3,c7i5fa,5," 

I (M22) met this girl (F21) and we?ve been in a relationship for around 3.5 months now. I?m deeply in love with her and I feel like I have a real connection and understanding with someone for the first time. However there is an issue that is slowly driving me mad.

So, she?s really into photography and she knows this guy that helped her out a lot with equipment and advice regarding photography. When I met her, she told me this guy was her mentor, as things started to get more serious between us she told me she had had an affair with this guy. He?s 40 years old and is married with two children. She told me that she is the main reason why he is filing for divorce and that he had plans to spend the rest of his life with her. Then she cut him off and told him that it doesn?t feel right for her anymore. She has told me that she is aware that the reason she has felt attracted to older men is that she grew up without a father. I accepted this because she was honest and I felt like it was over between them, at least on her part. She knew that I felt really uncomfortable with this and that it made me feel insecure.

She and him still keep contact, mainly for reasons relating to photography. She has also told me from the beginning that she has scheduled three wedding photography jobs with him in the summer. The first of them was 2 weeks ago. I told her it was okay for me and that I don?t mind her working with him. However, since then, they have texted with each other more than before. She has spent pretty much the last week at my place and on multiple occasions I saw notifications on her phone. She has acted a bit suspiciously, but that might just be because she knows that I wouldn?t like to hear about it, no matter what they are talking about.

Now comes the worst part for me. She has not told him that she is in a relationship. She knows how uncomfortable this makes me but says she can?t hurt his feelings after what she did to him. I tell her she has to choose my feelings over his when she wants this to work out. She is also afraid that telling him about me could lead to her losing a lot of advantages, such as equipment he allows her to use. I think this shouldn?t be an issue, because she told me that they have talked about their past and both want to move on. If he would actually react so badly, it would be a sign that he is still hoping to get her back. I don?t want to pressure her into telling him, because I know how important this stuff is for her and I don?t want to be the bad guy if she loses these opportunities. She says she is waiting ?for the right time to tell him? but has no idea when that will be or how she will know the time has come.

She also reacts very badly to me bringing up this issue. She calls me jealous, controlling and paranoid, all the while she is super jealous of my female roommate which we'll call ""M"". I have never had any interest in M, neither has she. We get along well but we have never spent time together outside of our apartment. M also has a boyfriend and is madly in love with him. Even though my GF knows both of them, she says she is worried that M could try and seduce me. She often says this after I bring up the topic of her ex, saying it's the same thing and that she also has to worry. She doesn't understand that there is a huge difference between having a roommate and an ex affair hanging around.

I love her to death but some aspects of her past just haunt me. She has told me that she has cheated on boyfriends before and that she ?played? men for fun. She says she has changed and I do believe her because I can feel that she loves me. She really does, I don?t have any doubts about that. What I do want her to understand is that she cannot continue to behave in certain ways that remind me of her past. When we?re alone she treats me like a king, but when we?re out or among people, I feel like she loses interest in me and enjoys the attention of other men a bit too much. She also has mostly male friends. I know this is partly due to her fun and open nature, and I don?t have a problem with that. It worries me that she can?t for the life of her admit any of this.

I feel like she doesn?t respect my boundaries, which she feels are ?controlling? and ?paranoid?. I don?t want to, but I feel like I will have to break things off with her if I want to have any respect for myself. I love her and she is good to me in many ways and has done a lot for me. She was patient with me and she knows I have my own shit to figure out. But the thought of never feeling 100% at peace is killing me and I don?t think it can work out for me longterm this way. There are just too many red flags for me.

Breaking up with her would hurt a lot, but I don?t want to waste my time wondering if I am the only one for her. Her saying that I am isn't enough for me if her actions speak otherwise. What's your opinion on this?

38,penny23sikes,[new],4,c7i04v,1,"I posted on here about a week ago about some communication problems I?ve had with my girlfriend because we live on opposite coasts of the country during summer. We met at college and hit it off and were together most of the year, when summer came along we decided that we would try long distance. For the first few weeks it was fine and I actually thought our relationship was getting stronger, we were talking everyday and were communicating well. 

As summer progressed, she began making new friends (she didn?t have any because her family had just moved to a new city while we were at school) and began hanging out with them everyday along with her busy work schedule. Our communication began to decline steadily over both Snapchat and FaceTime (Snapchat throughout the day and usually FaceTime before bed). She works about 8 hours almost every day and she would get out at 11 pm (8pm for me) and immediately go to hangout with her friends til long after I would be asleep. I felt neglected as this happened everyday and even though I?m happy that she found good friends, I still feel like she should have made more time for me.

It had gotten to the point where the only communication we would have is a short goodmorning text both ways, and I usually would get no response or a short uninterested response when I?d try to snap her during the day. I have brought this up to her multiple times and at first she seemed apologetic but nothing changed and now she has begun to get defensive when I bring it up. This is really upsetting to me because I have began to feel neglected and that she doesn?t care.

Finally after multiple times of her blowing me off to hang out with friends at times she has told me she would be available to talk, I left her a long message telling her exactly how I felt and that I could not got two more months this summer like this and that something had to change. This was last night.

I woke up this morning to a message back. She told me she was sorry she made me feel like that but that it was hard because she had things going on over there and that she couldn?t keep up with it all. She then said she thought we should take a break and she what we wanted to do when we got back to school in two months. She has already booked a flight to come visit me in a couple weeks, and she also added that she still wanted to do that.

I replied to her that it doesn?t make sense to me and that I thought it would do worse for our relationship than it would be good. I also added that I didn?t want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn?t want to be with me when it?s hard. We texted a little bit about it but really got nowhere before she had to go to work, where she is now. I?ve had a few more hours to think about it and I still really don?t like the idea, and I have a while more before she gets out of work.

Anyway I need advice on how to handle this situation. I love this girl and she means so much to me but I?m starting to feel like she isn?t taking this seriously, and now I am seriously considering breaking up for good. I don?t want to break up with her but it?s getting to the point where this has taken a serious toll on my happiness in general and at this point I just don?t onow what to do.

39,NotVPD,[new],9,c7i01p,1,"We are both 18 years old and have a great relationship. I?m never forcing and we are always understanding of each other. I?m not a very emotional person but I always get a little sad when my gf is crying and I hate seeing her cry. 

Yet for some reason I always get a raging hard on when she cries and then proceeds to hug me and bury her face into my chest. It?s not that I want sexual things in that moment, but for some reason I just get one. Could it be because her body is closer to me than just the usual hug/cuddle? This has occurred a few times and I?m pretty good at hiding it. Yesterday I was wearing some shorts so it was hard to hide and she saw it and commented on it.

40,kenneira,Relationships,0,c7hzwl,2,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 and a half years (met in high school). In the years since we started dating, I went to college and got my bachelors, and am currently working full time to save money for law school. I pay 100% of my own rent and expenses including my student loans, keep a tight budget and a calendar, take care of my dogs by myself, and generally consider myself to be a pretty responsible person.

My boyfriend is not there yet. As for school, I am not sure he'll ever graduate (not a dealbreaker for me on its own, college is not for everyone). Freshman year, he walked on to the basketball team at our college. However, he was injured before the season began and was not able to play. He has always struggled with school due to a learning disability, and dropped out halfway through sophomore year. I would honestly be totally okay with him not going to school if he had any other goals. He has no idea what he wants to do in life. Again, that is something I would be okay with since we are young and no one really knows what they want in their 20s. And it's not like he doesn't want a degree, he even likes learning, but he is terrified of failing at school, which stops him from even trying. But the way that college degrees are valued these days makes me worry he'll be at a severe disadvantage without one, even if it's a degree in general studies or something.

His financial sense (or lack thereof) worries me a bit. He works part time in food service, but his parents are pretty well-to-do and supply him with extra money. They also own his apartment, so he doesn't pay rent. He spends all his money on video games and workout clothes and stuff for his car, and then asks his parents to pay his bills.

I want to make it very clear that I love this person very much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. When we are together, I feel safer and more loved than I do with anyone else in my life. I know that he would do anything for me, and I would do anything for him. He is extremely emotionally in-tune and gave me the strength to seek help for mental health issues in college. We have compatible views on politics, religion, and all the ""big"" topics like that - including that we want to get married and have kids someday. Our families love each other and want to see us together forever. I truly want that too. I believe he is a very intelligent and good person, he just hasn't grown up yet. I feel as though I grew up a while ago.

I want to ask him to grow up a little, but I don't know if I am asking too much of him. I want to move forward in our relationship and start living more like adults. But we are still having dates like we did when I was in college where we just make out on my couch and play video games. We do still act like kids around each other, goofing around and having fun. I love that part of our relationship and wouldn't trade it for the world, but I want more. I just worry that I am getting too ahead of myself, that I am being too impatient. For example, I want to start a family with him someday when we are financially and emotionally ready. I want to be with him forever, so badly I can barely stand it sometimes. I don't want to rush him out of this phase of his life where he is carefree and having fun, but I feel out of place in that phase of life and wish sometimes that he would just move forward. I feel so guilty for this since everyone has their own timeline, but I love him so much and I just want him to be on the same page as me.

How long do I wait for him? Should I loosen up and act a little more like an irresponsible kid? Would it be shitty of me to ask him to get his butt in gear?

**TL;DR:** my boyfriend and I are out of sync. He acts his age (irresponsible 22 y.o. kid), but I think further into the future.

It was an amazing night, and it kept going because HE didn't want it to stop (I didn't either)! We talked FOREVER, even went to my friends party and when we were leaving he was like i wanna be more than just your work friend (i intro'd him as that to keep the questions down), which i was like wow okay I'm flattered! He KNEW I was not going to sleep w him or anything of the sort, since I had mentioned that while we were talking how I'm really not that girl and he was super respectful of that. 

&#x200B;

He never tried to make a move, said how many places he wanted to take me like diff breweries, gardens, etc., even wanted me to do a day trip w him! He was just CLEARLY so into me, when you know you know.... at least I thought?

&#x200B;

I tried to uber home and he said cancel that I'm taking you home and even rolled me a joint for when i got back. 

He left the next morning after we hung out for a work trip but said he was going to hit me up on Thursday when he was back for like two days....

&#x200B;

He also messaged me the next day after our date and asked me for a discount code to my weed store but didn't mention anything like how are you, or I had fun last night.... kind of a red flag I guess but just thought whatever he's trying to play it cool and he's super busy about to leave to NY for a shoot.... 

&#x200B;

So he left Sat night for the work trip, I messaged him on Sunday asking how it was... he didn't get back to me for 4 hours and then called me saying how insane the trip was and he was not into it at all and so stressed and tired already and asked me a lot about how I was and what I was doing but never mentioned hanging on Thurs. I was like whatever we'll def talk. 

&#x200B;

Basically he never messaged me again, HOWEVER, he posted a story on his Insta that was his bedroom and tagged Los Angeles... none of his stories in NY were tagged w location so I couldn't help but feel he was trying to say I'm home... lol? Maybe I'm cray for thinking that? It almost felt like a little slap in the face or a test to see if I'd message him... 

&#x200B;

I messaged him at like 4 in the afternoon the next day (BTW he deleted the story by the am so he didnt even wait for it to expire which is WEIRD to me....) 

&#x200B;

I said: ""Hii - r you back in town? how are you?""

He said: ""Hey! I am for the LA portion""

I said: "" My roommate just dipped and I gotta work a lil but if you wanna come vibe you can?""

&#x200B;

From there on I knew OK I'm on the bottom of the barrel of his priorities and somehow we made a big 180....

43,Cautious_Set,Non-Romantic,0,c7hvgs,1,"I have a friend who tore his hamstring about two years ago, and he hasn?t yet fully recovered. While his hamstring is no longer torn, he has faced many complicating injuries until now and his muscles have become very weak, and as a result is basically bedridden. He can still walk in short bursts, sometimes needing the aid of crutches, so he?s been going to physical therapy for a long time now to basically learn how to walk again. He, his mom and grandma currently stay with his aunt here in a city in the southern portion of the US, and his mom and grandma are his caregivers. But his aunt recently got married and informed him that they (he, his mom and grandma) have to vacate the house by October. He?s going to get an apartment with his mom and grandma in our current city.

&#x200B;

When he told me over the phone that his aunt was kicking them out, he told me that he felt really betrayed and at one point he broke into tears, saying, ?Who?s going to leave me next?? I felt really guilty upon hearing that, because I?ll be finishing college in December and have been thinking about moving to a different part of the country once I graduate.

&#x200B;

I?m not sure if he has any other friends in the area - he?s told me how he feels like most of his friends have fallen away since he got injured. I?m the only friend of his I know of who still hangs out with him. (He has friends outside of our city, but he can only text, Facetime, etc. them.)

&#x200B;

Also, as a result of this prolonged recovery he?s been going through, he attempted suicide in the recent past. The last time we talked about his mental health, he tried to assure me that he was OK by telling me he?s been getting therapy and that he?s been feeling better - but I fear that he might attempt suicide again. I tried to encourage him to talk with his mom and aunt, but I'm not sure if they know about his attempt. I?m worried that my leaving could contribute to him having suicidal ideation again.

&#x200B;

So now as I?m looking for jobs for after graduation, I?m basically wondering: would I be doing the wrong thing by moving away? Considering his struggles, I wonder if I should stay in the area so I can support him until he?s recovered.

44,WorriedWifehelp111,[new],9,c7hv6x,1,"TL;DR:
40 year old Husband checked out of mental hospital by mother with medical influence. Not allowed to see me. Barely allowed to talk to me. Says he wants to be here but his family won't let him leave! Pls help! As a wife, isn't he my medical responsibility??

This is going to sound so insane...I've changed a few details because husbands family knows I reddit..

My husband and I have been going to counseling for a year to get back our marriage after a decade of abuse and disrespect from him. The abuse was verbal and physical. A couple years ago I committed to standing up for myself and not allowing myself to be abused. There has been zero violence in 2 years! But the disrespect and lack of empathy and emotional intimacy was still present, and even more glaringly obvious. 

When I came to his family with his abuse they deflected and put me on trial. I felt being open was the best policy so I laid all my dirty laundry out (which is pretty run of the mill and pales in comparison.) It was a huge mistake. They focused on that and refused to acknowledge his abuse and even called me a liar even though he has told them time and time again it is fact. 

He has allowed them to berate me, yell and scream at me and blame me throughout this whole time. Its a miracle I didn't kill myself. I thought about it many times. I was alone. Because I chose to protect my husband and keep this in the family (his origin fam) and they weren't willing to be supportive of me, I was completely alone. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. Our pet was dying. We were both stressed. I needed a man who never knew how to really be there for me emotionally to be there emotionally all of a sudden. He freaked out. Left. Began to think about suicide. His therapist called him at the perfect time. I didn't know he was being taken to the hospital til he was messaging me freaking out. He said he was scared and that his mother dropped him off. (Important to note his mother works in psych too as a nurse) - he checks out next day. His mother is taking him to her house?? OK...he is able to talk to me for five minutes before his mother takes my 40 year old husbands phone away and doesn't allow him to contact me for almost 24 hours. Then after that contact is still limited. He seems to think this is normal and he has no say in the matter. He said he tried to escape to see me and his mother would not let him said he was on suicide watch and he isn't allowed to come anywhere near me. What the hell?! I tried calling his parents and got screamed at. I just discovered family enmeshment and it literally explains every issue we have had in this marriage and it makes sense that the more time he has spent around his family the more aggitated he gets and the more rude he is with me. He has been begging to see me. He has made it sound like he is being held against his will and it is doctors orders. 

I am sorry, this sounds sketchy AF...and I do not trust a family that calls me a liar, tells him they will disown him if he comes home to his wife. Is this absolutely not OK, and what rights do I have? 

last week he made mention of potentially being put on sedatives and psychotropics. I feel so terrified that this is a means to control him and he is starting to seem really different with me the last couple days when I was allowed to talk to him for a few mins. What are my options here???

And for anyone who believes he's lying...I have been screamed at by his family and also hear his mother telling him to hang up and he has to whisper to talk to me at all! I am scared for my husband! Yes he should have a backbone but how do you explain that to someone who believes this behavior to be normal ??

Then I got my mom's phone and texted her saying ""you are (crush's name) right?"" ""Can you unblock me I was the one who texted you hi and you blocked me"" ""Why did your dad say I'm watched"" She said ""Ahh ok"" ""It was because I told him before you saw us oh that's (my name) he'sin grade 6 to my dad so he went and told you were watched but he doesn't even know you?"" then I said ""Did you really like my bowtie??""

47,schniefke,Dating,0,c7hsit,1,"I met this guy a few weeks back through mutual friends. We hung out once - kinda accidentally (he was in the same area as me and we both had time on our hands) and it just clicked. He stayed for like 5 hours and it felt like minutes. Definitely also felt like a date, even though I kinda didn?t want to let me believe that. 
(I have the problem of always being the one more invested in the other person, which, combined with my naivety and tendency to trust until proven wrong, is the reason for bad relationships in the past and my anxiety / overthinking regarding romantic relationships.)


We saw each other again two days later and hung out for five days straight, even though we both can be called introverts and really need our ?alonetime?. Beeing with him just didn?t feel exhausting. 


Anyways, of course we finally had sex that one night, which was absolutely amazing. I never felt so at ease with beeing intimate with someone before. The way he looks at me makes me feel very sexy, feminine and wanted and that little glimmer in his eyes - it just gets me. We are very compatible. 

So of course we have a ton of sex now. 
And we cuddle *a lot*. All the time. I love giving backrubs and headscratches (I like to occupy my fingers / hands and I also really like touching him so - win win for me) and he loves receiving them (win win for both). 


He also invited me / textet me first just as much as I did him and he also very directly told me things like:

?I really enjoyed the last few days with you.?

?You are really cool? 
(He said that more than once, I translate that based on context and a probable inability to talk smoothly about emotions to an awkward ?I like you?)

?I want your attention.? (The timing on that one was very hot.)


So here it comes. 
He texted me one night and cancelled our planned day together because he just couldn?t handle company right now. 
I was obviously a little down because  A) I really like spending time with him  B) I was really horny and  C) I traveled 3 hours by train in the middle of the night after some rave to see him. 
BUT - I have been there myself, I understand what that feels like and I respect his need for distance. So I tell him that. And I also tell him that I hope everything else is ok (I already suspected that something  had happened, but I thought maybe he just finally had had enough of me.)


Turns out his mother fucked up somehow (I don?t know any specifics) and now his little brother has to live in a home that houses kids apart from their useless / failed parents. 
We just started talking about personal stuff like that so I just know his family life is quite broken and he has very little contact to his parents. He lives by and supports himself. 


So here is my problem:
We didn?t see each other for two weeks now. He originally had invited me to go to a rose garden or something like that in his hometown this weekend. But then I wouldn?t be on reddit right now. 

He texted me once after telling me about his mother to thank me. 
(He showed me how to fold an origami bird - so I put a folded bird and some nice origami paper, a little note and some snacks I showed him he likes in his mailbox.)

The mailbox mission and an unanswered ?How are you doing? are the only things I did to reach out to him in those two weeks. 


I am obviously very concerned about being too intense / demanding / pushy / stressful to him. I don?t want to make this situation about me. 
(Well between him and me at least.)
Also, we know of each other for like two month. And we hung out very intense for like three weeks - which was two weeks ago. 


What do I do. 
I really want to not let that ?maybe? between us die. I want to give it a chance. We barely had any time together, and this could really be something good. I want to get to know him, spend waaaay more time with him, explore the dynamic between us and also have a lot of fun and a lot of sex with him. 
Based on his behavoir beforehand, I would say he was open to that. 


I am also aware that his life (probably) just took a dramatic turn and that that chick he maybe kinda likes but also just met is obviously not that important right now. 


So. What do I do. 

Do I ?wait for him?? How long do I wait?
Do I try to meet up again?
Maybe call him?
Leave him be?
Crush my hopes?


And how do I not obsess over him, when all I can think of is his smile, and the look he gives me, and his touch. 


TL;DR

We hung out very intensely for three weeks. Great communication, very much fun together, awesome sex. Could possibly perhaps maybe become something. 
Then - life happens, he needs distance. Two weeks no contact.

Some background: We work in a small department at a demanding office job. I am in my mid 20's and my coworker is in her mid-40s. She took over my position when I was promoted about a year and a half ago. Overall we don't get along but I am an easygoing person so I keep things friendly with her for the most part. Our day to day responsibilities don't really overlap too much, but I inherit a lot of her work product and we share some clients. We also sit directly next to each other in cubicles.

So the first time I had an issue with her, I did confront her. She had left emails up on her computer screen to another person in our department (50sF), they had a thread about me saying nasty unnecessary things about my personal life and speculating about my medical condition even though I thought we were all on good terms. When I confronted her about the emails, she got super defensive and said she was talking about me because I'm bad at my job, and went on a tirade criticizing my work abilities. It completely caught me off guard and I was standing there crying like a dumbass.

I moved on from it but from that point on I decided I'm done dealing with her directly regarding workplace issues. Anytime I have an issue that involves her, I've been going to my boss or our office manager (whoever is more appropriate to deal with the situation). She gets fucking PISSED every time and throws a huge tantrum. For example this past Friday I came down from talking to the office manager about an issue that didn't even involve her, she just assumed I was talking about her and said ""you know I'm sitting right here, I don't know why you can't be an adult and talk to me directly"" and told me to ""keep \[her\] name out of \[my\] mouth"".

She has told me I'm acting like a preschooler, that I'm throwing her under the bus, and she is morally better than me because she would never do that. She also makes comments to herself about how she's the ""wrong person to fuck with"" and how ""people need to watch themselves"". I literally just ignore her because I have no idea how to respond to any of this. It's not like I'm going to file a complaint every day or for petty things. It's a small, insular office environment so issues are inevitable and she's made it so I don't feel comfortable addressing them with her.

I'm honestly just trying to do my job and get through the day. I don't know how to deal with her or what to do if an issue comes up again. Does anyone have advice about navigating this situation?

I had previously approached a guy I thought was interested in me and he reacted cold and in which made me insecure. 2. Jake?s best friend that introduced us (we?ll call him Ryan, also 31) has been making advances at me a little before I met Jake. I?ve told Ryan I wasn?t interested, but he would make me feel uncomfortable with sending me inappropriate snaps or make comments about my body and would make advances at me.

Jake lives in another state and visits the city I live in once in awhile to see family and friends. At this point I kind of gave up and focused work and going back to school.

Ryan and I became acquaintances. Fast forward, Ryan invites me to his wedding a few months ago. At the wedding Jake and I are at the same table and exchange a few conversations.

53,boyfriendproblems533,Relationships,5,c7hirj,1,"Is this weird? It feels weird, but this is my longest ever serious relationship. I?ve known my boyfriend for a year. We work together. He?s a funny and intelligent guy with a bit of a Ron Swanson masculine self-sufficiency vibe. The kind of guy you would want to be in a survival situation with.

When I first met him, he said that he didn?t have any living family. As we got more serious, the information started coming out in drips - his dad had died when he was young and his mom and sister when he was in his late teens, and that he?d moved for a fresh start. He also introduced me to these family friends who have known him since he was a baby (and there's photo and online evidence of this, they're not like plants or something). When I met them, they corroborated what he?d told me so far by saying his mom would have loved to meet me, etc., but otherwise they avoid the subject.

But there?s always been something off to me. First of all, he?s so cage-y with even the big details, like even the fact that he had also had a sister came relatively late in our relationship. Second of all, there?s nothing online corroborating the story of his mom/sister?s deaths, which, given the story he told me, isn?t a huge red flag but is a yellow flag. Third of all, that doesn?t really explain why he doesn?t seem to have a ?past? at all. No old MySpace or ancient FB posts, etc.

I thought until recently that maybe he was raised in some sort of cult that he/his family had escaped from, and that belief sort of helped me rationalize why he didn't want to talk.

But then the other day we just so happened to be talking about that kind of religious cult, and he talked about it so casually and with such obvious lack of personal knowledge/experience that it made me reframe and realize that there were other things he'd said/done that made religious cult a bad fit, and I?d ignored them because I subconsciously preferred having an explanation.

But I don't know what that leaves me with. I've carefully pressed him directly, but he closes off very quickly when I do, whether it's framed as jokey or serious. I'm trying to give him the time he needs but I also feel uncomfortable and insecure at how little I really know him.

55,davedontshave,[new],12,c7hhk3,6," 

I (M38) have two children (F10, M6) from a previous marriage. She (F40) has two children (M15, F11) from a previous marriage. We've been together \~2.5 years, combined households almost 2 years ago. We aren't married, but we are (were) committed to each other. We share a business 50/50. We've raised each other's kids, as she (we) have hers 100% of the time, and I have mine \~30% of the time.

&#x200B;

We've both been through hell in our past lives and have rebuilt ourselves to the people we are today. We both value mental health, balance, and compatibility. We're both attracted to each other, love one another, share a value system, and have cohesive life goals.

&#x200B;

However, when stress is high, we regress to our mutual survival behavior mechanisms. My natural stress-induced behavior is to overwork, reducing balance and shared life time. Her natural stress-induced behavior is to become incredibly cold and angry towards everyone outside of herself and her kids. She stops being reliable, ignoring her business responsibilities, leaving customers waiting. She starts doing rude behaviors, like flipping me off and calling me names. I often cook dinners for the whole family, and she forgets to show up, or specifically leaves the house with her kids to take them to dinner, alone.

&#x200B;

There are other factors that can be aggregated into the ""stress"" column, but aren't necessarily related to her behavior and my response (but could be): we share one car, there's a current court battle with my ex-spouse, our business is growing but very attention-hungry.

&#x200B;

Currently, it's Summer and we have all four kids. The house is for sale, the business is growing, finances are extremely tight, and stress is through the roof.

&#x200B;

Recently she's been saying that she doesn't know if she can do this. She struggles to relate to my kids, who we have a minority of the time. We talk through it, and usually are willing to have all ""tough conversations"". We both acknowledged it is a very high stress time right now, and making snap judgments aren't likely to be objective regarding the whole architecture of our relationship.

&#x200B;

Last week, she got triggered by all the transportation of kids for Summer, and reverted to her survival mode. Her attitude became cold towards me and my kids. We had a snafu with changed last-minute plans with her kids, and she responded angrily towards me when I brought up the plans we had already made. It became a ""them"" versus ""us"" thing, when it didn't need to be.

&#x200B;

That evening (last Friday), I told her it may be best for me to get my own place. She was being disparaging towards me and my kids, and she wasn't communicating with me at all. We've talked about communication improvements, and she's recognized that she treats me horribly when she's stressed (straight-up mean). I'd had enough, and it really hurt to be treated like shit by someone you love.

&#x200B;

The next day, she came to me and yelled at me, ""You think I've been disparaging? Just wait. I'll show you disparaging!"" She called me an asshole, told me to get the fuck out of her house (it is her house financially, as she bought it with her own money, despite us buying it and moving in together when we combined households). She's begun packing up all my stuff. She's yelling at me and quaking with anger every time she talks with me.

&#x200B;

Now she's saying stuff like I haven't paid rent (I've paid utilities, food, driven the kids, grown a shared business, etc. for 2 years). And she's so angry, that she only spits vitriol.

&#x200B;

Today she said she doesn't love me, we aren't friends, we aren't lovers, and I have to (again) get the fuck out of her house.

&#x200B;

I have my two little kids with me this Summer, and now I don't know what to do. I've already been through a nasty divorce three years ago. But leaving quickly from a shared household, when resources are shared, and finances are not ""flowing"", led to emergency behaviors (getting bridge jobs, moving in to ratty apartments, etc.).

&#x200B;

I know I spoke too soon, and probably didn't give her the same space I requested her to give to me. I just hurt so much from her treatment of me and my kids.

&#x200B;

I don't have a plan. I don't really have cash of my own that isn't used on the family, outside of the business, and I don't touch the company money.

&#x200B;

Any input would be helpful. Even if it's just regarding the next 24-hours. Thank you!

I winded up becoming horribly depressed in my blackout state, which caused my best friend to become upset and start to cry. Later that evening, I made things even worse by confessing my feelings to him. I just want to know how to salvage our friendship.   


I'll try to keep this as short as possible. On Friday night, I had friends come over to my apartment for a pre-game for a close friend's birthday party. Before they arrived, I had a couple of drinks to relax and de-stress; I've got a large amount of social anxiety, especially if I'm the host of the event. Looking back, I realize this pre-pre-game drinking was a massive mistake.

By the time that guests arrived, I'd already become fairly tipsy, and I continued to drink. I lost my memory about two hours into the pre-game. The only indications that I've been given about my behavior is that I began to ""belittle myself,"" locked into a drunken spiral of depression, and repeatedly told my best friend that he was a better person than I was. This might've caused him, and this is a quote from a text message that he later sent me, to ""feel a tad guilty about his successes,"" and became ""overwhelmed by the situation"" and started to cry. I cannot begin to express how much pain this causes me. He never, never, never deserved anything like that to happen.

Later on, the rest of the party left and he stayed behind to make sure that I was okay. This is when I confessed my crush on him. He told me, repeatedly, that he couldn't reciprocate these feelings. But I continued to make things awkward. I repeatedly asked for his permission to kiss his cheek (which he granted). And, at the end of the evening, I repeatedly asked if he wanted to sleep in my bed with me. He refused, and told me again and again that he didn't think that that was a good idea. (I'm very thankful he said this, in retrospect.) So I went to bed.

I woke up the next morning and he was still there, crashed on my futon. When he woke up, he explained to me that he wanted to stay and make sure that I was okay, and didn't spiral or obsess over the previous night's events. He also told me repeatedly to just ""move on,"" and use this as an opportunity to change my behavior for the future. He reassured me that our friendship was in ""good shape,"" told me to message him if I started to spiral, and gave me a hug before he left.

All I've done this weekend is stay in bed and hate myself. I truly felt like I did everything in my power to sabotage our friendship that night. Despite the fact that he simply wants us to move forward, I don't think that I can. All he's said that I can do to make it up to him is to ""take steps to take care of myself, and to avoid the steps that led to \[Friday night's\] behavior."" However, I'm worried that my obsession and extreme shame will cause even further damage to this friendship. I have no idea what else happened that night, and if he's decided to spare me of any further grief I might've caused. I could've insulted him or hurt him, and I'll never know.

I?ve been dating (let?s call him) Mike for almost two years. We met in college and everything has been great, he has all the qualities I have ever wanted in a man.

He just graduated college and I?m about to enter my junior year of college. I am convinced that there is no guy who could ever treat me with as much love as him.

I?ve told everyone at camp that I?ve already broken up with him and that I?m single to signal to others that I?m free to date around/hookup.

Anyway, she also talks about reincarnation a lot, and past lives, and thinks we knew each other in a past life. Again, I kind of let it slide, but she has recently started spending quite a lot of money on psychics, and on teachings from spiritual leaders who claim to channel energies and will help her to regress into her past lives and figure out her current problems. She's stopped seeing her therapist because she doesn't have time, but she does have time for all this. She's also been very depressed lately and I think that's another reason she's been grabbing onto this.

&#x200B;

For me, this has gone past ""cute and harmless"" and become something worrying. These people seem to be taking advantage of her. I don't know how to broach the subject in a way that doesn't seem condescending and like I don't take her seriously - she's an incredibly intelligent, sensitive woman, and she deeply believes in all of these things. But this seems like a dangerous scam to me. What should I do?

66,fuckingthrowaccount,[new],6,c7h49m,6,"Hey guys, this one is rough for me. My girlfriend and I have definitely had our fair share of problems (we went homeless together, have had plenty of fights, etc.) We've in a serious relationship for nearly 2 years now, and I found out something I don't know how to feel about.

&#x200B;

She has taken the liberty in the past to invade my own privacy by looking through my phone without permission. She found nothing because I have just that to hide. Last night I decided to take things into my own hands as well. She changed the passcode on her phone a few months ago which is sus, but she did say she would tell me the password so perhaps she forgot. I decided to head to her diary, which I know is a big moral no-no, but the deed is done so I can't look back.

&#x200B;

In her most recent submission, she wrote about a male friend of hers she's been spending a good chunk of time with. He told her he would like to fuck her, and she wrote ""I'm flattered, but I'm not sure that's such a good idea.""

&#x200B;

I may be reading way too into this, but a million red flags are flying in my face. Why the fuck would she be *flattered*? I understand it could be taken as a compliment, but to be *flattered* by a guy who **knows** she's in a committed relationship telling her h'ed like to fuck her just rubs me so wrong. She brought him by the house today before she headed off to work, and just seeing the way he looks at her and talks to her makes me want to fucking chokeslam the dude.

&#x200B;

The second thing I'm uncomfortable with is how she phrased she's not sure if thats a good idea. Why would she even entertain the thought?

&#x200B;

Trying to think of a good way to approach this without telling her I read her diary, but it seems that there's no solid way to go forth. My plan is to just stay updated on her logs, but I really don't want to keep violating her privacy if I'm just being a jealous little jerk. From some outside thought, should I get the fuck out now or try to talk with her about it? Thank you for your input.

His mom and dad are not together. I like his mom well enough but am not a fan of his dad.

68,Gentlemen_meet_Llug,Non-Romantic,13,c7h0y0,1,"tl;dr - My brother has severe social anxiety and resists getting treatment or medication for it even though he knows it helps from past experience. He wants to overcome it on his own terms but in the end consistently ends up doing nothing and spiraling further downward, seeing this upsets myself and our family. How can we help him back on track?

\---------------

My brother has been suffering from social anxiety for over a decade, but over the last 7ish years it has become so severe that some days he only comes out of his room for food or bathroom use. Sometimes he will venture to a redbox or go down to a convenient store for a snack. He spends most his hours playing video games and/or listening to political YouTube content and getting angry at a world he isn't even participating in or contributing to. He will stay up until the wee hours of the morning and doesn't typically come out of his room until noon or later. His physical health is actually fine, as he is naturally slim, but now I can see it's becoming a little sickly.

I recently fell into a situation where I had to move back in with my parents for the first time since I left for college, and until now did not realize how bad his social anxiety has gotten.

He has tried to work and ultimately he never sticks with it because human interaction (outside of family) overwhelms him. He once tried for a sales job, came home, and vomited because his anxiety was so terrible...and that was just a *single training day*.

He was getting treatment from a specialist for a couple years, taking medication, and it actually did him well, as he was spending time with friends again, and he was able to hold a job for a little while...until he stopped the treatment and the medication. He stopped the treatment because it was incredibly expensive and my parents were footing that bill, so I believe there was some guilt involved with that, and he stopped the meds because he doesn't like medication.

He wants to be ""normal"", and he hates that he cannot overcome this, it drives him into depression, which makes his anxiety even worse. He wants to find love, and work, and live out his life aspirations. He feels he is too stupid and worthless and broken to be loved or given an opportunity by anyone for anything.

It kills me to see him like this, some days I want to beat the anxiety and self doubt out of him because his behavior enrages me, but most days my heart aches for him terribly, and it kills my parents and siblings too.

How can I help him get treatment and go back on medication to begin bringing him back into the world?

Are there other alternatives or treatments that can be explored that don't require medication?

I fear this will only get worse as time marches forward, and he will end up attempting to end his life, even though he has never expressed those thoughts or feelings as of yet.

I had attended the graduation ceremony (which is different from the graduation dinner) which my mom and step dad had flown back to my original country to attend to.

But when I asked again she said no because I also came in late when I was meeting them the night after the graduation ceremony but that was because I had to pack my suitcase and I really didnt mean to be late, I would tried everything to prevent it.

It was hell, but I tried doing my best, working on my ""flaws"". Nothing worked, nothing changed. In the last week of our relationship, she completely ghosted me. I tried reaching her but didn't manage. Out of the blue, during rush hour at work, I receive a text from her, telling me this isn't working out for her nor me, so she's leaving me.

 For the first time in my life, I was depressed. I took me a long time to get over the fact that it wasn't my faulth that it ended the way it did. I was finally happy with myself and felt relieved of that madness our relationship turned out to be. 

I've decided to follow my long lost dream, that is joining the army. 

Now, she started messaging me, talking to me irl, like we're friends or some sh*t. But my feelings for her are gone.

Turns out she went to a bar to meet her friends love interest, let?s call him Mike, and two dudes he brought with him. I?ve met Mike, he?s a cool guy, never met the two other guys. It?s a 2 girl 3 guy dynamic.

Fast forward a couple hours and my girlfriend and her friend went back to my girlfriend?s place at 1am with Mike and 1 other guy who I?ve never met. Uncomfortable with that for sure.

Next morning she calls me and wants to ?talk?. Tells me what happened and says that the reason she was not on her phone is she was really anxious the whole night.(?)

I tried to calmly explain that I wasn?t comfortable bringing a random guy I?ve never met back to her place at 1am and not texting me a single time. Since the dynamic wasn?t a big party and it was a couple + my girlfriend + random guy I wasn?t cool with it.

Finally she?s crying and said she hasn?t done anything today she just feels anxious about what happened and has only taken a bath. I just told her not to do that again and I wasn?t to happy and needed to go to the gym to get my mind clear.

First of all I?m a little concerned she might have cheated on me, I mean the signs could be there? When i asked if the guy made any advances on her she insisted that he didn?t.

He apologized profusely and it was water under the bridge later that day when we were texting about other things that had nothing to do with it. In other words, it hasn?t been brought up, I thought we were good. We even brought up our date planned for yesterday. I?d like to mention, in 10 months, we have never once had a fight.

The following day (Wednesday), I shot him a text which went ignored. No biggie, a lot of times he doesn?t respond until evening due to his very demanding job. He also has kids. We both do, so aside from work, he is very busy when he does have them. I ended up calling him that evening and he didn?t answer. But later called me back. He was with his kids so I?m not sure if this is why he did not seem engaged. I asked him if we were still on Saturday. Now he says ?I?m not sure, I have so much work and far behind.? So I?m left hanging. Thursday goes by, not a peep from him. Finally late Friday afternoon, he is still at one of his job sites and texts me that he has no idea how he is going to be able to see me Saturday because he is so far behind that he is working the whole weekend. I told him I understood and to please give me a call when he?s on his way home. I honestly just wanted to hear his voice because I missed him and knew I wouldn?t be seeing him. So he calls me, sounding so cold and pissy because he was exhausted and worked late. He said he is losing sleep and losing weight because of everything going on. The conversation ends after less than 10 minutes and that was it.

So yesterday comes around. The day I was supposed to see him. I?d like to mention he hasn?t cancelled a date in months, even during a busy time, so this is on my mind and I?m overthinking, wondering if he?s planning on leaving and just lacks a spine. I wanted to share what I was feeling, and I knew he was working so I text him that when I talked to him the night prior, he sounded upset and it feels like he is pulling away, like he doesn?t want me around anymore. And if that?s the case, to please just let me know. And that I know he?s under a lot of stress, hope things settle soon for him, and that I miss him. His response was that he was sorry it seemed that way but he?s just trying to focus on the job and deadlines as he has been short handed this week and he?s just trying to get through it all. Didn?t even say he missed me too or give me any type of reassurance for that matter.

I often struggle with my words, I don't always say the right things and it scares me, being alone scares me. I feel powerless, I want her to be happy but I dont want her to think that her being the way she is will bring me down, I have told her so many times what she means to me.

***************BACKSTORY****************
(We had been highschool sweethearts who broke up after 1st year of Uni.We lost touch over 20 years, during which time, we both got married and are now separated from our spouses. He has kids and I don't.)
******************************************

In January, I had been separated for 9 months when he contacted me on Facebook messenger. He has been separated 3 years.

SPARKS FLEW. We video chatted almost daily. I totally couldn't believe what a handsome, incredible man he had become....and he was just so happy and funny.  And he was crazy about me too.

Only one issue.  He was militantly non-monogamous. He had joined ""the lifestyle"" (swingers clubs) when he was married and had never stopped being a part of the lifestyle. From January to March, we'd lovingly chat...but he was totally honest about the fact that he still went out on dates and was sexually active. ( I hadnt been sexually active with anyone since my husband).

Finally he came to see me in March (after requisite medical testing was performed). SPARKS FLEW!!!!!!! We were so.....connected....
In love, omg...it was so special....yayyyyy

Then when he left, he went back to his sexual lifestyle and I just didn't want anyone but him, so I didn't (with the exception of one dumb tinder date). 

He had this ongoing relationship with a woman he referred to as a drop dead gorgeous 30 year old latina dancer.  But he didn't have a great emotional connection with her...he just liked her cuz she was hot and could go on dates with her...and sex parties and stuff. But it sounded as thought they couldnt get into the depth of intimacy that he had with me. I wasnt jealous...UNTIL. ..

He had arranged to visit me at the end of this July...I told him that I had been soul searching and realized that I think we can't really be together because I have a monogamous heart and he doesnt.

He tried to talk me into seeing things his way...that these  girls he sleep with mean nothing to him....but the other day, Istood my ground and said ""no...if you sleep with anyone between now and when you plan to visit ...don't bother visiting.'

He totally pushed back and got upset cuz he'd had made plans with the dancer for July that he didn't want to break.

I told him that I cannot feel good about our relationship if he continues with those plans.

You see...he says he loves me best...and if he does...breaking plans with the dancer shouldnt be a problem, right?

Anyway...he finally relented and said he'd break plans with her and not sleep with anyone till he comes to see me.

I believe him...but then I asked him if he resents me for my request. He says he can't answer that question right now.


Anyway...yesterday the whole thing kinda blew up because he was on this wine tour with a platonic female friend with whom he used to be intimate but is no longer intimate....and he messaged me to talk about her.

I told him that I simply didnt wanna hear about any other women...whether he's still sleeping with them or not...it makes me feel like garbage.


Anyway...I told him that I was going out last night and I think it'll be a good idea if we don't talk until he comes to visit.

He said ok.

And I said ""cool...see u when you're in my city""

He said ""you're the one making these rules""

True.

He probably thinks I'm gonna relent and message him before his arrival date but I refuse. 

Also...I had been SOOOOO excited about him coming...I was soooo excited about our connection...it takes a lot for me to feel anything real for anyone  ....but now I just don't care that he's coming   ....I'm sad that our sizzle has fizzled.


I told him that my feelings toward him.were lessening because of his insistence on seeing other women. He said that his feelings toward me are still strong.


I'm not sure what to do.

If I see him, will I just be repulsed because he's a dirty snake?

Or will I be so excited to see him because we still have a beautiful connection?


Or will I just not care anymore....

I'm feeling like I just don't care anymore.


I love having something to look forward to...I LOVED looking forward to his visit.

But now....


Not so much.

Should I just call it off?


Just tell him my feelings have changed and let him cancel the ticket?

Because I think they have.

80,anxious-future,Non-Romantic,7,c7g3er,2,"I've never really asked for advice on this part of my life, and it's always been a weird subject for me that I've avoided talking about with others as well. I'll do my best but I'm sorry if this is messy, I'll include a tldr at the bottom. 

My biological father (I'll call him John) wasn't present for most of my life growing up. My mom fell pregnant after they were together for 6 months and decided to keep the baby, which he was vehemently against. They stayed together and were a bit on/off again as far as I know until she finally moved closer to her own family for the birth, breaking up with him right before it.

John wasn't around up until my 6th birthday (although I saw my paternal grandparents a few times, and my aunt, according to old photos and videos), when he and my mom tried to give it another go. He was introduced to me as my dad and took me on a few day trips and gave me presents. They broke up again, mom moved countries with her new boyfriend and me, and that was that. I rang John once from the new country and he said he was too busy to talk to me. 

I was 18 when I got back in touch, living in my own apartment. My mom had never mentioned him much and hated reminders that my stepdad wasn't my actual dad so it was a forgotten subject for a long time. John was ecstatic when I got back in touch. He'd always had my address (my paternal grandparents sent a card every birthday and Christmas for me) but we hadn't spoken since I was 7. I hadn't even seen his face or heard anything about him. 

I was back in my home country at that point, he came up to visit with his long-term girlfriend, things were fine. I was (still am) a big nerd and I could feel that disconnect in our interests but he was very polite about it, haha. I could tell he was making an effort. I was processing a lot back then and he'd never had other kids and didn't really know how to act. A few months later he helped me move to the south of the country to be closer to him and my paternal family, as I'd coincidentally been hoping to go to college in a town by their location anyway. We didn't see each other as much as I'd wanted to, a few visits, but mostly with other people present. 

Eventually I moved away again, he visited once. I didn't have the funds during that time to visit but he knew that and we talked every few months over the phone. 

Two years later, work took me abroad again to a country around 4 hours away by plane. I visited three times, he visited none. We didn't talk much over the phone. 

Last year I moved to a country 1.5 hours away by plane. I haven't visited yet and neither has he. 2018 was also the year he began having open marriage problems with his now wife, and he phoned me often for advice and to vent (healthily) about it. I adore his wife so I often recommended marriage counselling, and felt happy he felt he could talk to me and that we were talking more. 

His marriage is doing a lot better now. In early 2019, I found out my mom is suffering from severe mental problems and I told John about it. I've not had the best relationship with my mom but it hurt to realise that no parts of her I recognise really exist anymore, and the situation is complicated and heartbreaking. John listened when I spoke to him at first and recommended I distanced myself from the situation. I phoned him with updates every so often and he seemed to appreciate that, asking me to keep updating him when anything important happened. 

Then in the last few months:

- John now wants for me to call him ""Dad"". It's not a demand but he said it's all he would want from our relationship. He signed his birthday card to me as ""Dad"" as well. I've said it's a big step and we need to talk about that, as we don't have much of a relationship to build that off right now. He admitted he's tried to be an ""older friend"" to me for years as he didn't think I wanted a father figure. I said a good first step would be for him to take the initiative to phone me more often and he agreed (this was 1.5 months ago).

- On our birthday (we share one), he could only spare 20 minutes for a phonecall while he was at work. He had multiple other birthday celebrations planned so I was hurt he didn't make the time to talk to me more, since we've never spent a birthday together. When I communicated this, he said I should have said something earlier but eventually apologised. I also said I would improve communicating and that if he wants me to call him Dad, I'll need him to be more present and willing to also take initiative (It's been me phoning him 90% of the time) 


- I'm in a gay relationship and he's gotten upset that I'm planning to have my partner's children, that wouldn't be mine biologically


- I mentioned wanting to go to therapy to help me process what's happening with my mom and my relationship with her in general and he said I'm a stronger person than that. He knows I've suffered with agoraphobia and social anxiety in the past and really fucked up my health by working full-time without mental health support, so this hurt (I messaged him about this gently and he apologised) 


He keeps promising to phone and then gets too busy. At this time of my life, I really do need family and I feel he's emotionally letting me down at every turn. I was there for him when he needed me last year and now he's distancing himself and forgetting to phone mutiple times in a row. To be dramatic about it, every time it happens I feel like that kid again being told he's too busy to talk. 

I've recently told him to give me some distance for a bit because it hurts when he doesn't phone when he says he will. He's seen the message, no response (although I did ask him for space, so I assume he's just respecting that). 

I don't know how to go forward. He's said some things that have really hurt, but when I've communicated about that he's listened and usually apologises by the end of the conversation. The biggest issue is him letting me down by not visiting (even though I visit when I can, paying my own way), and not reaching out, especially when he says he will. He promised to not do that anymore and yet still does. I'm at the end of my emotional patience with him and I don't know how to move forwards with communicating with him. Please help. 

tl;dr: Complicated relationship with my biological father, no contact while growing up. Contact when I turned 18. Now the sparkles have worn off and he seems disinterested and distant in my existence even though he's requesting I call him ""Dad"" now. Not sure how to proceed since I've already been honest with him about my thoughts and recently had to ask for some space since he keeps being too busy to phone when he says he will (and if he randomly phoned me while I'm processing how I feel about this I think I'd just be angry).",1561910244.0,I (26F) don't know how to talk to my biological father (52M).,1.0

Side note I had to change the original word to floozy because the post got taken down, but floozy is a stand in for another word that starts with ?sl? and rhymes with nut.

So some backstory. And as an ahead a lot of this will be rather personal, and yes I know at the end of the day it isn't my business, but i'm trying to change a bad opinion and that's why i'm trying to speak candidly. I will straight up say all my thoughts in the hopes that maybe there?s a crucial core to my feelings that people can help me change. I have kept a lot of this bottled up, so I apologize if it?s long and there?s unnecessary detail.

My friend, let's call her Nancy (31F), and I (M23) have been friends for a little under a year. It is a platonic relationship, although admittedly I may have had some feelings for her in the past, but I am over such feelings. I feel people will get caught up on this, but I can assure none of the following is rooted in previous feelings. Now I genuinely like Nancy as a friend, I agree on her with a lot of stuff and we came from similar backgrounds. That said there is one thing I really kind of disagree on, her view of relationships.

It's hard to explain in so many words, but she essentially views relationships as very disposable. Not to say she doesn't put effort into them, just that she has blatantly said she really doesn't ever expect a relationship to last and she's okay with it. I personally disagree, but i've never quite said as much to her.

Secondly, I can't really shake the feeling that I kind of think she's a bit of a floozy (I would say another word here, but the post has been taken down for it). Before I really dive into that, let me be clear, I don?t think it?s wrong to have sex be it with a committed relationship or honestly a hookup on occasion, I feel she?s a floozy for some mixed reasons. Let me explain why. Part of the reason I suppose is because she low key floozy shames, she trash talks girls who dress provocatively, and she trash talks people who sleep around even though when asked she'll say she doesn't care if people do. I've known her for under a year and in that time she's had two committed relationships yet she's slept with around 5 guys. I know it's the modern era and all, but truth be told I guess I kind of do feel that's a decent amount for under a year when a good chunk of that year supposedly she was monogamous.

She does this thing where she?ll be mostly seeing one person, even sleeping with them, but still dates on the side stating that they aren?t exclusive. Supposedly she doesn?t sleep with the guys she sees on the side, but I guess I just generally feel uncomfortable with that set up. I feel it?s unfair to the main guy that she still sees others, and its unfair to the other guys that she?s simultaneously screwing with someone else.
She also is really wishy washy with owning up to how many people she's slept with. As friends we shoot the shit and the topic has come up a few times, and she's changed her answer from as low as 9 to the high teens. And to me it seems kind of weird to either not know or to purposefully change the number so drastically.

I will be square. The number of people she slept with isn't exactly sky high even if it is say 19, supposedly she didn't lose her virginity until her late teens if not at 20. Then she was supposedly in a totally monogamous relationship for 5 non-consecutive years. So with the 5 in the last year, 12 people over 5 years isn't bad I suppose, I mean yes I?ll be honest it does still seem somewhat on the high side to me but I guess part of it is the people she has slept with.

The most recent guy she went on her first date with and four days later I know she was sleeping with him. Before that I don't know the exact timing, but I believe it was within a week of meeting the guy also. One of the last guys she was dating she knew had slept with over 40 women, and she shames him for it, yet she still was with him for a good little bit of time. Lastly I suppose I?m kind of uncomfortable with the fact that she essentially had a fuck buddy for 5 non-consecutive years while she still dated other people.

To kind of wrap things up while we were hanging out once I was looking for something and opened her nightstand drawer to find tons of condoms, a deck of sex position cards, some weird pills, sex toys, and some sex outfits. In total fairness there?s nothing wrong with any of this stuff, and it is totally normal stuff to have, I guess just kind of going back to how she can low key floozy shame I found it a bit hypocritical to have so much stuff specifically geared for sex.

So all of this is to say, well yes I kind of think she?s a floozy but at the same time I know that?s a wrong and unfair opinion to have. I want to get over this opinion, but it?s hard to when everyone?s answer is essentially ?what she does is her business.? I agree, but it doesn?t change my feelings and I really would like to as I do still see her as a good friend. I just need help, how can I get over these negative feelings? Should I speak to her about this?

82,RomanceTale,[new],17,c7fxp1,37,"My dad recently got involved with Facebook to keep up with his grandkid that moved across the country.  I was happy to help him get a laptop, set up his accounts, all that, as he's computer illiterate.  He's had a couple stumbles on the internet, but nothing outside of what a 70+ year old is going to have.  He's bought a few bogus products from the ad's on the side of Facebook, gotten some viruses, nothing too terrible.  Recently I found out he's been getting interested in online dating, which he explained as an easy way for an older, single guy to be able to meet and chat.  I gave the digital birds-and-bees speech about possible scams, catfishing, and the importance of keeping your social security number to your god damn self which he seemed receptive to and so I let him go at it.  

He's run into a number of scams, which usually involve the scammer wanting to speak ""privately"" over email, so I've started monitoring his email.  I feel bad about the voyeurism and invading his privacy, but he's a prime mark for getting scammed.  Totally computer illiterate, fairly wealthy, optimistic to the point of naive, can't type so whenever he gets a scam email written in broken English just assumes the other person can't type either, and has had several relationships with younger, powerful women during his (earlier) lifetime.  He's been on the hook during many of these email exchanges, genuinely believing that some Texas oil baron or international concierge doctor really wants to meet him based on the two grainy photos he uploaded to FarmersOnly, even slyly mentioning his new paramours to me over lunch.  But he always stopped whenever the inevitable request for personal information, a wire transfer, or an oddly high number of iTunes gift cards came along.  He never would mention it to me, but I'd see the email exchanges halt, and he'd be a little pouty for a day or two after.

Recently I got a call from a bank where I'm an authorized user on one of his accounts.  They called with some questions about recent payments on the accounts, which I tracked down to a scam Asian dating site.  I went over and checked on my dad's laptop, and sure enough he's wildly active on the site.  Four months in and he's spent over $1,000.  I asked him about it, and he's convinced these women aren't a scam because it's on a ""website"" and the website ""guarantees"" all the women are real.  The photos are just airbrushed model shots and the messages he's paying to respond to are just automated dribble that some bot spams out to him.  He's sending large payments for private photos and one-on-one conversations, where the flow of the conversation does seem to indicate it's a real person, but obviously not who he believes it to be.

I'm torn a bit on what to do.  My immediate reaction is to confront him and try to reason with him, but I'm concerned that the costs he's already sunk into these ""relationships"" would just make him entrench his belief that these women are real.  I'd be perfectly happy to pay for a more legitimate website and try to transition him over, but I know he's not going to find women of the young model-type calibre that are going to fawn over him like these bots do.  I also wonder if it's even my place.  It seems to make him happy and gives him something to do in the evenings.  He's got plenty of money to do it, and the money is rightfully his, not mine.  If he keeps it to a reasonable spending limit, maybe it's just blissful ignorance?

My plan as of now is to ask him about the payments and see if he comes clean about what the payments are and the amounts.  If he's honest, softly express my opinions about what the website really is and try to gently reason with him.  If he's not honest, do the same but be more harsh.  He's real soft on his grandkid, and has a second on the way, and I think I could make a stinging point about the amount he's spending on these women relative to the much lesser amount he's spending on them.  Offer up a legitimate site as an alternative, and continue to monitor his email/accounts to see if the spending gets worse.  Has anybody been here before?  Any advice?

&#x200B;

My girlfriend \[21F\] and I \[21M\] have been together for almost two years now. We started dating sophomore year of college and we?re both going to be seniors in the fall. Things have been going really well. She is my best friend and an amazing partner. We?ve never really had any major arguments, and I think it?s because we both understand the best way to solve anything is to communicate and stay open minded. There?s one issue that?s been difficult for me though: her ex-boyfriend. Maybe I?m only making it worse by rehashing it, but here?s the issues:

&#x200B;

1.	I think my girlfriend is an amazing person. Biased, I know, but she?s fluent in two languages, athletic as hell (could?ve played D1 soccer), in our university?s honors program, and is writing her thesis on combating climate change with more sustainable agriculture practices. She wants to save the world and it?s truly inspiring to be around. Despite all this, she suffers from severe self-confidence and self-esteem issues. We?ve talked about it and she?s called herself stupid, lazy, worthless, and pretty much every other demeaning term you can imagine. A big reason for her problem is her ex-boyfriend. They dated in high school (her junior year), and he treated her like absolute shit. He cheated on her multiple times with some of her closest friends. He told her at the end of their relationship that he never really loved her and that she meant nothing to him. She said stayed with him for about a year through all this because he was manipulative and she couldn?t find the strength to leave. I know getting upset with her for not leaving earlier is asinine and victim-blaming, and I know judging her for her past mistakes is unfair. I?ve tried my best to tell her how wonderful she is and how I?ll always be there to support her when she?s not feeling her best. However, I?ve found myself getting frustrated when she continues to think she?s worthless or can?t find confidence. It upsets me that she?s letting her self-worth still be determined by some 19-year-old dickbag she used to date. Sometimes I just want to scream. I get particularly frustrated because I think it affects aspects of our relationship. We won?t try new things because she thinks she?ll look like an idiot or doesn?t think she?ll be any good. We end up sticking in a routine because it?s where she feels comfortable and more confident. I won?t ever force her to do things that make her uncomfortable, but I think she'd enjoy life so much more if she wasn?t constantly feeling worthless. I know I can only continue to be supportive, but is it normal/justified for me to be feeling this frustration?

2.	As I already mentioned, she was with this dickbag her junior year of high school. Personally, I never really had a serious relationship in high school. I liked girls here and there, but never of them really amounted to anything. It was mostly just some hookups and a few ?flings? that didn?t last very long. My girlfriend is my first real commitment, and I think I?m very lucky I didn?t have to go through a bunch of assholes to find her. As she?s told me about the trauma she carries from her previous boyfriend though, a small part of me dismisses it. I don?t think I would ever admit it to her, but that small part of me thinks no high school relationship (especially one that only lasted around a year) should affect you like it has done to her. High schoolers are dumb and immature, and I think that?s why most high school relationships are dumb and immature. Every person deserves to be treated with respect and dignity (which he clearly didn?t), but can you really be traumatized for years over a high school relationship? I know I?ve never been in a long-term relationship until now, but I think back to the girls who went to my high school, and I find myself confirming that none of them were mature and genuine enough for me to give them a second thought. While I know exceptions exist, I think my girlfriend?s previous relationship was definitely not one of them. I feel a little guilty even typing this, but it?s the truth. Is it completely wrong for me to (at least in part) dismiss some of her trauma? Am I missing something entirely? Can and should a failed high school relationship really have the impact on you that I think it?s had on her?

3.	The last issue is probably the most immature, but it?s also the one that seems to bother me the most. If I haven?t made it clear enough at this point, her ex-boyfriend was a total asshole. And by what I gather, he seems like a complete loser as well. He hasn?t come up all that often and I don?t think she?s hanging on, but when he has come up, my girlfriend bashes him pretty hard. I think rightfully so. She thinks he?s the worst person she knows. What gets me is that she still has clothes and gifts from him that she wears frequently. One of her favorite sweaters is his. Up until I got her a necklace for her birthday, she wore one that he bought her. She wears some of his t-shirts too. One time she was wearing one when she was bashing him. I tried focusing on what she was saying, but all I could think about was how weird it felt with her wearing the shirt. I know they?re just clothes and that almost every girl ever wears clothes from boys, but any time she?s wearing them, I feel like he?s still in her life. If it were me, I would have tossed all that stuff in the trash. When we?re together and she?s wearing the sweater, I always want to tell her that it bothers me and that I?d gladly give her one of mine or get her a new one. (She wears my hoodies but hasn?t taken to any of my sweaters) I haven?t told her because I always feel immature for letting something so small bother me. I believe in the quote ?You can tell the size of a person by the size of the things that bother them?. I don?t want to be that guy that tells her what she can and cannot wear, but it always makes me uncomfortable. Is it normal to feel this way? Am I overreacting? Should I not care about how it makes me look and just tell her?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My girlfriend dated an asshole in high school and it's affected her self-confidence. I find myself getting frustrated with her over it. I've also found myself dismissing some of the trauma she carries because I don't know if I believe high school relationships should carry that much weight. Lastly, I get upset/uncomfortable with her wearing his old clothes when she's told me how terrible he was.

1.	Is it normal/justified for me to be feeling frustrated with her lack of confidence?

2.	Is it completely wrong to (at least in part) dismiss trauma from a failed high school relationship?

3.	Is it normal to be upset over my girlfriend wearing her ex-boyfriend?s clothes all the time? Should I tell her or is it better to just get over it?

85,deathstalkerscorpion,[new],9,c7fnxn,2,"A few years ago when I was having a conversation with my younger sister, I saw that she got a notification from someone I didn't recognize. Her phone was on the table, and I happened to see the notification because we were having breakfast together. I thought it was odd because it was from an app called ""Couple"" which I used with my boyfriend at the time. It's an app that you wouldn't be using with anyone except a SO. I didn't say anything because we weren't close at the time and I didn't want to make things weird. 

Since then however, I've noticed a lot of incidents that indicated she had an online boyfriend. She would randomly receive packages with gifts from a different state. She's also very secretive with her electronics and has a privacy screen on all of them. Sometimes when I'm hanging out with her, I can see Discord notifications pop up from a guy, always with the same flirty nicknames.

I'm not going to lie - I got nosy and I started snooping. I didn't snoop on her phone because I thought that might be too personal and too much of an invasion of privacy. But I figured social media is fair game because it's all public. So I stalked her followers on literally everything and started watching her social media activity. She's been very good at hiding him and I thought I wouldn't be able to find anything UNTIL I checked her Spotify account. Her only follower was a guy named Robert. In all of the notifications that have popped up when I spent time with her, the name of the dude was Rob. So basically, I Googled him and found out everything about him. If I'm not mistaken, she's been dating this guy for years.

My sister and I were not very close growing up due to a number of reasons. Within the past few years, we've gotten closer and get along better now. I can tell that she trusts me more than she used to, but obviously not fully because she hasn't told me about him yet. I suspect that she hasn't told me because she might be embarrassed that she met him online, but I don't think that's it. She knows I have a lot of internet friends and that I don't think it's weird at all. Also, I thought about the fact that she might have a sugar daddy, but honestly the gifts that she gets are few and far in between.

Anyway, she's been talking about moving far away to another state for a long time. My family has been mostly supportive, but they think it's because she wants to go to school there. The truth is that she most likely just wants to be with this guy and I doubt it has anything to do with school. It bothers me because our family doesn't even know about this guy. I know for a fact that my parents would never let her do this without at least meeting him first. I really don't think it's a big deal that they met online. I *do* think it's a big deal that she's wanting to do this without anyone in the family knowing about what's going on. 

Should I say something? What would be the repercussions of doing so? I think there's a good chance she may never trust me again if I bring it up but at the same time I don't think she should do this without anyone knowing. Especially because he's older. I'm hesitant about going straight to my family though because I don't want her to think that I've betrayed her (even though she technically never confided in me and told me about him). I feel like I should go to her first. Currently we get along better than we used to, but our relationship still isn't great for siblings.

86,girlonvacation,Personal issues,13,c7flpk,9,"Hi guys, I consider this a personal issue. Hope I can get some advice from you.

I'm from Croatia with some family (cousins) in Pennsylvania, US. I've been visiting them since the last month with my sister and her boyfriend who are here for work. While they are at medical seminars, I spend most of my free time with cousins A. (19f) and H. (23f).

I don't know if I'm annoying to A. and H. They let me hang out with them and even their friends, but they have often said that I seem cold. I'm naturally shy, maybe that's the problem. Also sometimes when they're talking very fast I don't understand everything, so I could seem uninterested. But I usually don't say anything because I don't want to interrupt the conversation between everyone else and be a party-breaker.

Another thing, I'm worried about my language use. My English is okay I think but A. and H. say I'm not polite. For example if I need something, I just say ""Give me that"" like I'm used in Croatian but I should say ""Could you please give me that?"" That doesn't come natural to me unfortunately and it's a problem. I feel dumb when I say such long phrases because in Croatian, they will make you sound arrogant with friends.

87,sarah0200,Infidelity,18,c7fien,0,"My bf recently cheated (it was a short kiss as they both swear). He was so shitfaced, especially because he didnt drink alcohol for almost a year before that (medical reasons) so he forgo about what how much he can take, and im not trying to justify him or his actions. He swore that he didnt know what was he doing, that he felt almost like he was drugged and that he never got into this state of mind/body. Thats probably true because he really isnt an ""alcohol guy"" and i never saw him that drunk as that night (we were together at a party). He got into a female bathroom, that girl (my EX very good friend) was standing in her stall coming out to the part where you wash hands and he got to her and they got into a stall, closed the doors and kissed for one or two seconds. In the same  i was looking for her and i went to bathroom and knocked on the doors and she came out  and literally pushed me away from there saying that shes feeling sick and needs some air and that i need to go with her outside. BUT then i saw him inside that freaking stall and i ran out and then drama started and blah blah blah i wont go into details sorry.. Few weeks ago I could've swore with my whole life that he would NEVER cheat on me, he never talked to any girls, he never lied to me, he never treated me wrong. And there is absolutely no chance that he was faking any of that. We even just recently had a talk about people who cheat and we agreed that we dont understand people who do that shit and that he would rather end the relationship immidiately if he even knew that there is a possibility thag he could ever cheat... and look at us now. I love that man more than i love myself, i can say the same for him. He IS my life and we planned our future together. He is still coming to my place alomst every day with flowers, apologies, calling me, saying how dumb and sorry he is and begging me for oke more chance because he wasnt aware of his actions and that he could never do that to me in ""real"" life... He is really trying, i cant lie about that. My heart says that we can work on it, but idk... i dont wanna lose that man, i know him and i know that what he did that night isnt the person he is. My trust is def. broken but could i be able to heal and forgive this? Have you ever been in a situation like this? Have you ever forgave something like this and had a great relationship after? And also what bothers me is is it possible that they said the truth? Btw that girl is a virgin (at 22) and really shy so idk.. is it really possible that they only kissed and that he realised that ""something"" is wrong, as he says??

To summarize: she dated a man for 10 years from 21yoa to 31yoa which ended about 4 years ago officially but they had kept in contact since then off and on until we started dating.  Once we were dating she made it somewhat (all be it reluctantly) clear to him that she was dating someone and no longer wanted to have contact with him.  This happened via text, email
And even a face to face discussion.  

Due to the ex not really taking the hint, and continuously sending random (once every few weeks) texts or emails, she blocked him on those mediums.  

Occasionally since the start of this year she would mention getting a letter in the mail from him.  The two she spoke of were Valentine?s Day and her birthday (recent).  I initially didn?t see a problem in this being that she had no control over what he sent her in the mail and I was more concerned about her response to this occurring.  

Very recently I had to look for something around her place and couldn?t find it for the life of me.... As I looked through a drawer in her closet I stumbled upon the letters she spoke of and quite a few more (4-5).  All hand written on a card with the envelope.  All opened and placed hidden at the bottom of a drawer covered by clothing.  

My question in this.  What she my response here be?  Why would she save the letters in the first place? Why would she even open the letters in the first place? Advice?

89,tiredaf12345,[new],52,c7fcix,64,"Hey everyone, I'll try and get right to it.  


My bf is naturally an assertive person, whereas I'm completely the opposite. Been together for 4 years, and this dynamic in our personalities usually works for the best. I can sometimes (hopefully) teach him the importance of patience and tact, and he can teach me how to be more of a go getter and stand up for myself.  


Anyway, his father came over to visit today. His father is a lovely man and we get on so well. Bf also had his kid daughter over too, so it was a nice little family catch up.  


We ran out of milk (they all love their tea), and bf said ""could you do me a favour?"" and asked if I'd go get some up the shop in my car. Honestly, that would not be a problem for me, we're as equal as we can be in terms of finances (although I currently make a little less than him, I've always tried to be as giving as I possibly, possibly can and am, as of tomorrow, starting a new job earning a bit more too now.)  


So I said yes of course, and he suddenly snapped and went, ""Nevermind, I will go,"" and started to get up. His father looked confused and I said, ""Honestly, I don't mind!"" and he just...snapped? He went on this major rant, ""NO you pulled a face, you clearly DON'T want to go so don't BOTHER"" whilst raising his voice, and I got up and said, ""Babe I am absolutely fine to go, seriously!"" and i could feel myself getting embarrassed as this was clearly making his daughter and father uncomfortable/confused.   


I'm the type of person that really doesn't like shit like this, if ever i have some sort of problem with him for instance and his daughter is there, i would NEVER bring it up until we have privacy. Ever. in the past he's not been so tactful.  


So his dad says, ""Mate, I really think she's happy to go up, there's no need!"" and bf just continued on ranting, grabbing his keys, almost making a big show of it all? His father even offered to go himself, his daughter btw just looked even more uncomfortable.  


I thought, ""Fuck this shit, not only didn't I mind going in the first place but now i genuinely want to get out of the house for a second"" as i could feel my face burning with embarrassment for his dad and daughter. So I get my keys and smile calmly as to try and hold some peace in the room and say, ""It's okay! I wont be a second"" and i ask the others if they wanted anything and they said no thank you. But before i was about to leave bf looked at me seriously and said, ""Seriously now. do not go. you don't want to go, do you"" I was confused as fuck and calmly left, picked up the milk. Daughter and father stayed for another two hours and we all watched some netflix and bf never once looked at me. so when he went into the kitchen to grab a drink, i quietly went in and made sure my voice was low and calm so the others couldn't hear.  


I said, ""Do me a favour, next time you have an issue with me, don't react like that. It's embarrassing as fuck. And of course I didn't mind going, I didn't 'pull a face'"" and of course this fixed nothing.  


""Yes you fucking did! After all I do for you, I took you out for dinner the other day! This is the second time you pulled a face!"" again his voice was raising so i thought, ""Fuck this, I don't want it to get worse with dad and daughter in the living room"" as his comment about him 'doing so much for me' was another can of worms for another time.  


An hour or so later, his father (they're both really close) asked bf to help him set up a finger scanning thing on his phone. His father is just over 70 years old, and whilst sharp as fuck, his memory or small motor functions aren't perfect these days. Anyway he was having trouble getting it right, and again bf was snapping like fuck, ""JUST HOLD IT STILL FOR GOD SAKE"" which was clearly making his dad more flumuxed so it did take a good five minutes to get right, all the while bf ranted and raved and lost his cool about ""IT'S NOT THAT HARD FOR GOD SAKE, TRY AGAIN - NO NOT LIKE THAT, LIKE THIS"" talking to him like he was a fucking idiot. How his father kept his cool I've no idea (apparently back in the day his dad was far more strict and straight talking).  


What got me was bf's behaviour was, again, in front of his daughter. She looked uncomfortable again. What sort of example is he setting? I SO wanted to say something to him but christ it would've made things worse.   


This was all around an hour ago, and now it's just us two of course he won't talk to me. When he thinks he's right (which is all the time), he will cold shoulder me for days at a time if he so feels like it.  


I'm absolutely sick of this. I've got a new big job starting tomorrow and I'm scared shitless. I've got university work I need to catch up on as I haven't had the time as I work full time. I'm tired, stressed, and yes a little sensitive. But the way he is - this is common. Not to such extremes as today. Also I have one more thing I need to rant about and get advice / perspectives over before I forget.  


Last week I overloaded the clothes horse/clothes hanger as I hung too many wet towels and the thing broke. About half a year ago it broke because the cat jumped on it, lol. I bought a new one (about ?10) so when this happened the other week again, due to my own fault, I went out and bought a new one two days later. I admitted to him, didn't defend or argue or shit, I just owned up to it and bought another. No biggie, it happens, lesson learned.  


Anyway, the day I bought it, i was sleeping at around 3pm as I came home from a nightshift. I could hear constant tinking and banging, and when I checked (as it woke me up) i saw bf seemingly repairing the one I'd broke a few days ago. Even though I told him I'd just bought a new one. I thought it was weird and i didn't even mention it, as i thought he was playing a weird game and i couldn't be arsed.  


Anyway, later that evening he points it out to me.  


""notice I fixed it?"" and i said, ""Yup...I'm not sure why though, as the one I bought today is right there, unopened?"" and he said, ""I fixed it to teach you a lesson.""  


Flumuxed, I asked what lesson did I need to be taught? I explained I admitted fault, and bought a new one as soon as i could.   


He claimed, because it's happened twice (he kept saying it wasn't the cat the first time, it was me) that it shows i clearly have a lack of care for things. (bare in mind also the first one broke around maybe a year or so ago?) i was just baffled. i couldn't get my words out i was so confused. he had such a smug expression whilst saying it.  


I said, ""I've already paid for a new one no questions asked, i just...why did you do this?""  


He smiled and said, ""Good. You're getting angry, it'll teach you.""  


Again his daughter was in the living room during us being in the kitchen, i just shook my head in disbelief. It seemed bizarre and wrong. So I just walked off.   


So THAT was yesterday. Today was when he went on  his bizarre rants in front of his father about me.   


Hes always been a hot head (not violent at all however) in terms of his opinions. Very ""I MUST BE HEARD NOW"" and often speaks out of impulse. However....ah i'm just so tired

For the last 4 years my bff (26f) has been in a relationship with this guy. I never had any strong opinions about him until 2 years ago we had a chance to spend some time together in a couples? holiday. 

One evening me and her bf (lets call him Ben) were the last ones in the bar. We both were a bit tipsy and we were ranting about politics. 
Everything was fine until we started to go deeper... where do I even start... he honestly believes that all black people are likely to rob him, all men are superior to women and all vegetarians/vegans and homosexuals are a god?s curse to humanity. I was as much in a shock as you, my friend would never think that... perhaps..?

He?s spent the last days of our holiday making fun of my food choices. 

After the awful trip I had a talk with my bff explaining what happened, she said sorry but didn?t see anything wrong with him having such hateful opinions. ?It?s just him? she said.

Ever since I?ve been trying to avoid all parties where Ben was present. The ones I did attend were terrible, he started calling me a ?grass eater? just as a punch line. I?ve also heard gossip that he?s talking even worse stuff behind my back but him being racist is already enough to avoid him.

In the end I?ve missed a lot of social gatherings because of Ben and kinda drifted apart from my friend. I?ve never been in such situation before

Background 

Almost 3 years dating, a few more days and it?s our anniversary. We?re both good terms with family. We?re both good terms when not fighting. No physical violence. No verbal abuse. We fight, she gives silent treatments, I give her time, i think of what I did wrong, I apologize, I give her more time, we?re okay. Rinse repeat. We?re on an LDR. We?ve been physically together for a year vs almost 2 years LDR. Add in the factor that she was suppose to graduate but school didn?t let her and she had to take one more class because they screwed up. Shitty ass school.

Situation :

When our first year dating. Everything was good. We were open to one another. If we fought, we would apologize to each other and talk it out. Always looking towards the better future. All was good.

Second year dating, things were okay. We would fight, she won?t apologize but acknowledge her mistake when we talked it out. We fought more but we would fix it. But she would always lean on the she?s letting me do what I want and she does what she wants sort of like breaking up but it doesn?t happen.

3rd year dating, she gets angry at everything. I followed some cosplayers, some celebrities, some pretty women who I enjoy their fashion statement and blogs on Instagram, and some models. Being a guy I think that?s normal. She expressed her anger and I slowly stopped. I follow more car pages now. I followed 2 girls last month, one which I know and another an influencer. She got mad. I explained to her, she shut up without a word. I then quit my job as I passed my state exam and saw an opportunity to spend physical time with her. I?m currently on a 2 month vacation so I decided to spend that much time with her flying 7000 miles across the world just to see her. Now here are our current issues.

Issues 

Currently living in a condo together.

She doesn?t want to have sex because she said her body will change. I bought condoms just in case also for safety. She saw it and got mad and judged me as a lowly being who only wanted sex. I felt offended but brushed it off.

She started to be more hyperactive, I asked why in order to understand this new behavior and she gives me the silent treatment and doesn?t speak to me the entire night. I proceeded to sleep because I?m not putting up with this childish behavior.

She asked me when I was seeing my family side, which I?m not close with. I jokingly and sleepingly said you want me to go? She said who said you?re going alone? I?ll go with you. THEN she got mad and gave me silent treatment saying why did I have to say that. I proceeded to ignore this childish behavior and slept it off. 

The thing is when I give her space, I apologize, give her more space, we?re good. But I know that?s not how it should be. And we also both want our relationship to work but she seems very impossible at the moment. Also not to mention she?s on her period but this doesn?t justify her behaviors. At the end of the day we both love each other. But at the same time it?s taxing on my mental health. I don?t even know if I?m being mentally abused or what. I can?t even confide our issues in her. She gets angry at every issue mentioned. Tonight, steam went off. She got mad, I told her off and how she?s acting like a child with her actions and to actually be my partner when we fight not some fearmongering individual. Shoot me some advice.

92,lavernespies,Breakups,3,c7f08s,1,"As the title says, my (20F) boyfriend (20M) of a year and a half broke up with me to deal with self esteem and family issues alone in therapy because, in his words, he can't love me properly if he doesn't love himself.

For context, his parents (married 30 years) are getting a divorce because his mom just learned not only that his dad beat the kids their whole lives, but also that he cheated on her. I know it sounds far fetched that she didn't know this, but she was an alcoholic for most of their childhood. 

To make matters worse, his dad hit his younger sister for the first time a month or so ago, and my very nonviolent boyfriend drove an hour to beat the living hell out of him for hurting someone so defenseless. 

Meanwhile, my dad died this past November. My boyfriend and I found the body- it was very sudden, and he had no prior health complications. It was very traumatic for the both of us, but my boyfriend never really talked about how much it impacted him, as well. Though, I know it did. Because of my dad's death, I was diagnosed with PTSD, and have also had anxiety for several years that has just become... debilitating. I've been to the ER several times in the past year for panic attacks that I thought were recurrences of a heart condition that I had treated in high school.

Needless to say- the past year has been incredibly traumatic and overwhelming for us both. In spite of this, we were stronger than ever this past month. We rarely fought, or even disagreed. We both believed firmly in communicating our feelings, and not bottling things up. He tells me I have helped him become the most self aware he has ever been; however, he refused to get therapy because his father told him his whole life that real men don't get therapy (toxic masculinity at its finest). 

We were on a trip to Michigan last week so I could meet his extended family, and- to keep a long story short, he broke up with me the day before we were supposed to go home. 

We have full access to each other's phones, devices, etc and I was working on a project for a summer class on his laptop, because mine is broken. He sent himself a picture for me to use in the presentation, so I opened the messages only to find messages with his best friend open, planning to end things with me. I panicked.

We lived together for the past 8 months or so after my dad died because I could no longer afford my dorm room- this was his idea, and it went beautifully. He also told me it would be okay to live with him this coming school year, so I hadn't signed up for, or began to save for, a dorm on campus. Further, I haven't had a car for a couple of years, so I also relied on him for transportation from school, back home, and vice versa. 

I was obviously distraught, and still am, at the thought of all of this. It basically became a week-long breakup, as we had to fly home, I had to move out, etc. He has told me since square one of this break up, that it is only a break, and he will be back. He told me I didn't have to wait for him, but he swore that he would wait for me. He also told me I could talk to him as much as I want, as he loves and misses me anyway. When I moved out, I pretty much had to do it alone because he ""couldn't stand to see me"" because it hurt him too much. We've talked on the phone once, and it really made me feel so good just to hear his voice. Finally, yesterday, after I continuously reached out the past week and felt sort of empty-handed because he had begun growing distant, and I knew I couldn't convince him to change his mind. So, I decided that I will distance myself for now, as well. It's killing me, but I know we both need it.

In all of this, I feel so frustrated and confused because the only things changing in his life are that he is going to therapy, and letting me go. To me, it seems like, if I'm the only thing that's changing, then he sees me as the problem. He swears it's not true, but especially now that I have to distance myself, I can't help but feel like I was hurting him by relying on him so much.

Am I wrong? How do I STOP being codependent? My sister told me recently that she thinks I have always been very codependent, and I don't know how to break that cycle. How do I stop relying on him and being codependent while simultaneously dealing with that heartbreak? 

Any advice on how to get through this, or if I'm perceiving it wrong, please help me see that.

Thank you for reading.

So, uh, my boyfriend (18) and I (16F) have been dating for *nine months*, but he confided me that since the beginning of our relationship, he's already had *many* crushes on different persons. What's truly bothering me is that he looks very close to the girls he likes... Here are some concrete examples :

\-Praising them a lot, but rarely doing the same when he talks to me or about me

\-During our first month of relationship, he rejected a girl who was flirting with him, but often talks about this event saying he regrets to have done this

\-Getting very, very often close to them, like making them sitting on his lap, touching them, groping them, then saying that ""it's for fun"" and that ""it's not cheating""

\-He recently asked me what I wanted as a birthday present, I said a book. He asked me if I could ""choose something else"" because it's expensive and he's saving for ""a gift for \[insert the name of the girl he likes here\]"" ~~maybe it's not that serious""~~

\-I recently visited him and he said ""I was supposed to spend the day with \[name of the girl he likes\], it's a shame that you came over""

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is a true problem though. I've lost many friends over the past 2 years and have been fearing abandonment a lot since, so what if I'm just overreacting because of the fear of losing him ? :/ That is why I would like an objective point of view on the situation, because I feel a little emotionally fucked up and unable to think rationally rn.

So I?m doing a degree in Australia, and my family is in Canada. HUGE time zone difference. Yet, I never go more than 36-48 hours without calling my mom for at least 1 hour at a time (or tbh she calls me and I pick up or call back as soon as I can). I?m constantly in touch with my siblings and my friends. The fact that I?m still so tight with everyone back home amazes me. They all miss me, and I?m grateful for that. But. BUT. 

EVERY TIME I call my mom back, even within 3 hours, the first thing she says is ?I was worried about you?. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Even if I messaged her when I?d call her back. Even if I?m talking on the family group chat. Obviously I?M FINE. I have no idea what she?s guilt tripping me for. So I ask her ?why were you worried?? She gives me a nonsense generic answer. Then I have to justify WHY I didn?t pick up the phone. It?s all just so ridiculous. I?m not the partying type. I?ve never done drugs in my life. I have never had a single sip of alcohol. I don?t live on the edge. I?m very education focused. There is literally nothing, absolutely nothing, that I could be doing that would concern her.

So I called her back in 4 hours. Same conversation starter as always. She kept saying she was worried for me. That I?m the only daughter she has, she can?t lose me. I shouldn?t be out after sunset in a mysterious city. I kind of lost it, I raised my voice a bit and demanded what she wanted from me. She had no answer.

Long summary:

There's this girl who works at my regular bar (when I say regular, I mean the ONLY one I go to when I do go - has been for 3 years), I'm sure she's new (3 months new) as she has only just started being there after it was rebuilt after a fire and in fact, I've only just started going more recently after it was rebuilt. Anyhow, I can sense she's a shy/awkward type of girl, but I'm unsure if she currently has an initial attraction to me. I've only seen her there 3 times (within a week and a half).

First time was me making a booking, I was being myself, making little jokes here and there and both bartenders were smiling/laughing a bit, but then I went after. I wasn't there long. That's when she caught my eye.

2 days later, she came in to start her shift and as she walked through the bar area she had her head down a bit and looked at me out the corner of her eye and smiled a bit and walked on. We've had a few interactions, but nothing major, but she seemed receptive (though she may well be doing her job). When I ordered a non-alcoholic cider (I'm on tablets at the moment) I said ""Am I the only one who drinks these?"" and she looked me in the eyes and said ""I think you are"" looked down and smiled a bit and then went on to say that others do buy them with which I said ""Do people just give em' their kids?"" which she did a little smile to again.

When she walks around the bar, she does seem to try and avoid eye contact with me but I've caught her looking at me a few times. One from the other bar which is opposite I sit which I can see through a doorway, and once she crouched down to the left of me, behind the bar, to do something and I looked out of curiosity and she looked up at me with only her eyes, not her head. Yesterday, she was walking through the door way and caught my eyes and she did a half/shy kind of smile and looked down at an angle.

Last night, a random guy came up to me at the bar and said ""I like your beard. Can I stroke it?"" I went, ""Sure, why not?"" and he stroked it and then he said ""Can I have a selfie?"" and I said ""Sure, go on then."" and we had a selfie. She was in in front of us pouring a drink and I looked to see her and she had a proper big grin on her face and was laughing quietly but I don't think she looked at us during the whole interaction. I said some say I look like Billy Connolly or Sirius Black and she laughed more but no laughing noise came out. But I could see her chuckling.

96,HourSection5,[new],17,c7eiir,6,"Lived with my partner for 2 years (common law is 3 years here in my part of Canada). But we were together for 8 years in total (my daughters (14f, 16f) and I lived in our own apartment for the first 8 years we dated). (I have consulted a lawyer -- no, we are not considered common law without having physically lived together for 3 years).

&#x200B;

I loved my partner very much but we had a terrible awful year. There were many stresses and neither of us behaved well. He also was struggling with being sober (he quit drinking the year before and no longer had it as a crutch during bad times).

&#x200B;

He ended up cheating on me (meeting up with the woman 5 times over a 6 week period). I had no idea. He decided to end it with her (he claims out of guilt). I didn't find out until quite some time later when the woman's husband discovered their texts and contacted me.

&#x200B;

I took my daughters and rented an apartment with my savings. I don't have a job (while we lived together I looked after things at home and since leaving I have not been able to find a job....unfortunately I do not have a college degree and it's very challenging here).

&#x200B;

I'm now in the worst time of my life so far:

\- My father (who lives on a pension and is 2 hours away) has started to display moderate signs of dementia. He's in a rural area and if he loses his driver's licence he will be screwed. He lives in the family home just filled with ""stuff"" and isn't bad enough that he'd want to move to assisted living. But I'm really scared because he's becoming more confused by the week. I'm also an only child and there's no family to help.

&#x200B;

\- My daughters go to 2 separate schools (one daughter is in a school specifically tailored to her special needs). When I lived with my partner this was no problem. Now that I'm alone, I am unsure of how to get them both to their schools (in opposite directions) and still be able to find a job myself and get us all there on time.

&#x200B;

\- I've been looking very hard for work and have not found anything. I haven't even located temp work. I will blow through my savings in no time at this rate.

&#x200B;

My partner still wants to be with me. My daughters however (oblivious to the stresses I'm under), do not want to move back there. We have a lease on this apartment for a year, and they are happy here. My partner has anger management issues and there was always a lot of tension in our house. My daughters really like living away from the house. 

&#x200B;

But I'm scared. I'm middle-aged. I'm finding it really hard to find a job. I need to somehow look after my dad (and this will be more necessary within this coming year I'm sure). As it is, I've taken over organizing his bill payments because he kept missing payments. I'm responsible for 2 teenaged girls. I'm suffering from depression and I am failing at everything. I have NO CLUE what type of job I could get at this point with my skill set that will pay enough for us to survive on.

&#x200B;

I keep thinking I should put my tail between my legs and go back to my partner. But I can't get the images out of my head. Not only did he cheat on me.....he had unprotected sex with her, while also having sex with me. When I get upset he tells me if ""we"" caught anything it's no big deal -- a course of antibiotics would kill it. I feel rage towards him.

&#x200B;

I have no idea what to do and I'm utterly lost. I was hoping anyone on here would have an outside perspective.

97,notexcused,Dating,4,c7ehwu,2,"He's a friend of a friend, we've talked at a few parties but were always dating other people. I've always found him very attractive. This time we were both single, and spoke for a couple hours (non sexual) while ignoring the party. I asked to go home with him, he enthusiastically agreed and we had sex for hours. Great time, good connection. I'd love to see him again even if nothing comes of it.

He knows I'm leaving tomorrow (gone for a year, back once a month), but asked for my number. He messaged me after he got to work, we small chatted about being tired, then that was it. I messaged him later saying I was going out with friends and hope he was having a good night. We chatted a bit, he was exhausted and went to bed. I was pretty drunk, said he was cuter than the couch I was sleeping on. He responded favorably, but didn't take the bait. The bar isn't his scene.

He's really good friends with one of my friends. He describes himself as an introvert and my friend says he doesn't initiate much socially. I've done most of the initiating so far (I started speaking to him, ask to go to his place, initiated the most recent text conversation), but we did have a fantastic time.

Part of me wants to have no shame and continue pursuing. Worse comes to worse, I come off a little strong and I'm gone the next day anyway. Best case scenario I get another good date out of it.

I'm going to a boardgame night, so I was thinking I could invite him to that. Casual, we'll still have a chance to interact but I can still go home with him. Or, just saying that I'm in town today if he wants to grab coffee or a drink. 

I was thinking I could call too, but texting usually reads as more casual.

It's the first time I've felt a decent connection in years, so even if it's brief I'd like to explore it one more time. But maybe I should accept that if he hasn't asked me yet that it's not going to happen. What's the best way to go about it?

I'm in college and I broke up with my ex a year ago (the relationship also lasted a year). While we were together she asked about what my grades were in high school and I told her I performed much better than I actually did (claiming I was an A+ student when I got mostly C's and D's). I told her and my friends that I had an internship over the break when really I went to live back with my parents, as I was in a major depressive state and couldn't function properly and I didn't want to admit this. When she asked me about my past I occasionally made up stories about events in my life or past relationships in high school. I also wasn't honest with her about my desire for other girls when we were together, or the interactions between myself and others.

I've been extremely mentally ill over the last few years which I don't believe is an excuse for what I've done nor do I feel that I shouldn't suffer any of the consequences, but I believe it is relevant in the context of my behaviour. I have seen a psychiatrist and I now have medication to aid with the depression, anxiety and general mental instability.

As far as I know, they aren't aware that I lied. I'm feeling incredibly guilty about this and I can't avoid hating myself for my actions. I realize how important honesty and trust is and how disrespectful and appalling it is to lie to people. I feel immensely ashamed of myself to the point where it is making me a lot more depressed.

I want to come clean with everyone I have lied to and sincerely apologize. I plan on meeting up with them and telling them in person one on one when I can see them next.

99,Dancingwhithdoggos,[new],1,c7dzsi,1,"TL;DR : I need advice to move on from a really manipulative ex.

I have cut contact with my ex, (if I can call him that ) a week ago, and I'm struggling a lot, even if have clear why I don,t wanna back with him, I can, t help gets nostalgic and sad he really charming and manipulative, and I'm worried he grab me in soft moment and I start all this shith again. I want to know how others stayed strong and moved on in my situation. For give you all more context, this is the main fucked points about him and our relationship.

1. He wanted me to be his partner in all the good thing's but nothing about the commitment.He always sold me this idea of we being so close, besties, and kinda lovers, calling each others bae and being really sexual and loving, I was ""one of the most important persons in his life"", but there was always a excuse for us to don't date seriously, we wasn't exactly fuck buddy's either cause he said he didn't fuck no one without feelings, so it wasn't me catching feelings on a temporal hook up, was he insisting on be closer emotionally .
2. He always had a lot of new groups and friendships always one or two of these friendships will have a crush on him, he always flirted back and later complained, he didn't get why people fell in love with him, even if he always were sending mixed signals to everyone interested in him, he just said that's how he was, and people didn't get is humor, didn't understand the difference between jokes and seducing and never brother on think how his crushes will take is behavior around them
3. After be a soft sweetheart and so loving with me, he will suddenly confess to my face days or hours later that he wasn't sure if he ever loved someone or even knew how it feel, throwing all especial moment's we just have had as nothing important in his mind. Since we weren't nothing serious beside act like a couple with me daily, he will go hock up and have fun with whoever had a crush on him at the moment jealously and betrayal was awful, but if I dared talk it with him, he will say he liked my ""jealous protective side"", but that he wasn't ready for nothing serious yet I don't have the I don't have the right to get mad or ""own him"".
4. He asked me a lot of times directly and indirectly to wait for him, but at the same time accepted I could date others and move on, Ofc, he will be so disappointed and cold with me if I ever dare try dating or meeting new people.He always complained of how money centered his family was, but always had ""fans"", people crazily and desperately in love with him, that will buy him gifts and send him money I was one of these people for a while too. All his ex would return to him in a blink to the point he could just ask for anything he wanted, or ask to go live with them to another country and they will move hearth and wind for making it possible and forgive him if he changed his mind weeks later.
5. He knew I came from an abusive household and had issues with a genetic bipolar disorder, I was in therapy and medication and I improved a lot with hard work, but every time we disagreed on something, he will say I didn't change, that was an oversensitive crazy girl, no matter how rational I tried to be, how many therapy tools I learned to communicate my feelings better, for him I don't changed in nothing, he will use my problems against me gasligthing me until I doubt if getting mad at him or show my needs or discomfort for legit reasons was just me overreacting. This fucked me up a lot, even if my therapist and friend said I improved a lot, a fight with him will throw be to believe I was sick overdramatic trash and I will never improve.
6. He used his own issues as an excuse for being cold and uncaring, whenever he wanted or didn't feel like being nice to me, be passive aggressive with me and everyone was the usual, but later will complain he did so much for me and never was as nice with no one else as with me, for him basic respect and care was some kind of privilege I should be grateful about.Beside admit he had a lot of problems he will refuse to do therapy seriously and face his issues, it just didn't work for him once so wasn't worth of try again.
7. He will pull down or insult random people appearing, judge and give opinion on completely stranger's, but insists it was constructive criticism and it was just how his culture was (French), it was just fun and jokes and if found it rude I just was being a boring girl with no humor.
8. He was extremely insecure and will pull down himself a lot, entering in almost sick rants on the mirror about how much he hated himself, he needed compliments daily, praising and love, but you could count with the fingers of your hand how many times he was loving back or tried be loving. He said it was cause he struggled to open up with people. But the true it's he was way to drown in his own self for even bother on compliment someone else, sadly a lot of him compliments always came out of being jealous of someone else. If he complimented someone else will because he wanted what they had: clothes, hair style, muscle...
9. He always was right about everything, but get defensive and remind you that time he give you the reason just so you saw how reasonable and mature he was. He always pulled himself like a saviour and a saint for other's saying how tired and good he was for take care of his sick mom and sis, complaining of how he was the only one reasonable on his family and how he always had to sacrifice for others sake. He was a school dropout with no work. His way to support his family was just be there and be nice. For him that made him a saint beside just talk shith about them to me as fast as he had a moment,the only one he treated well, in an honest way, was his mom. he was a huge mom boy I thought it was endearing, but you could tell he wasn't the one caring of his mom was the opposite, his mom keeps him protected from the outside world and he shared way to much private stuff with her, even show her private talks with me if we fought, and told me his mom finds me ridiculous to so I should accept I'm in the wrong, ofc he will always show her cut parts where was already losing my shith with him out of context. I never could talk directly to his mom cause she didn't knew how to speak English but she actually agreed with me in a lot of stuff at some points when he told him more details, he then will be pissed off and don't talk about the issue anymore, his mom was actually a really sweet amazing lady but she had created a little monster by accident.

At the end of the day he took for granted people love, care and help, and acted like he always did all his own and was him against the world, even with me, we weren't a team helping each other, was him being so nice and dealing with my shith cause he loved me and I should be grateful and don't complain much, my help and all his friends and family help weren't a thing or he will just say he didn't ask for it anyway. He refused to learn stuff from other's even if he asked for help with it. I let this pass cause I had hopes he will be serious with me one day, that we both improved each other, hoping he will start to overcome his issues and be the nice version of himself naturally. That I really was important for him. The reality is that I had just been another in a long list of people he tricked and used for his benefit, consciously or unconsciously he always attracted and used everyone around him and to this day I doubt he will ever change. for me he a ex and one of my worst ones.

Anyway we recently have got to the bottom of it and he tells me finally that hes struggling mostly with anxiety for performance and in himself as the partner.

Ive tried relaxing him beforehand with massages or kissing and playing around but I can rarely get him in the mood now even from that... im trying to not let him see its affecting me so much so it doesnt add to the pressure and damage his issues more but I told him last night I would like to see him speak to someome or get some help because I feel lost with what to do and I need a sex life tbh! 

He never has a nice thing to say about himself with how he looks and I have tried to many times to really explain to him how attracted I am to him and how much I love him but that doesnt change how he feels...

I am not really sure what is needed right now so posting here. I was out at a bar with some girls, having a great time, the drinks were flowing as it was a special occasion. I was pretty drunk, but it really hit once I was at home. I came in and was puking all over the bathroom. I have a young daughter with my husband and woke them up. I am ashamed to say my daughter was quite scared seeing me in such a state. My husband was (rightfully) livid. I was in such a state that we argued about it, and I asked why the hell he is helping me. He said it's because i'm his wife and he has to, and I said possibly the most hurtful thing I've ever said... I said that I didn't ask for my life, I didn't ask to be married with a kid.
This is absolutely not true and I don't know why I said it. I think my drunk logic thought that he was just putting up with me, not only that night but in life, so what's the point. I love my husband and my daughter to the bottom of my heart. My husband is hurt so badly now and I don't know how to make this right.  I don't want to lose him. 

For background info, not putting this as an excuse but context... I have been struggling with feeling lonely and out of place in the world. Throughout my life I feel like I've just drifted through friendship groups and find it difficult to make solid connections, and have been seriously betrayed by people in the past as well. I have some people I am close to, but they wouldn't consider me as good a friend as they are to me.
I get very anxious about coming across as odd and uninteresting, and to compensate I like to drink to be more confident/chatty. It feels like my personality has changed for the worse since having a child, as I have lost confidence in chatting to people not only on nights out/social situations, but in everyday situations such as at work or with other parents at school. I find myself saying weird things and seeing confusion on people's faces or glances between people wondering what the fuck I'm talking about. I do wonder if the friends I do have are just putting up with me. 
I also have trichotillomania and it has been really bad the last year or so, so hiding the patches of thinning hair is another thing i get very anxious about.
I dont go out and drink at bars regularly, maybe once a year, but there have been a few times like last night when I have drunk to excess and been an absolute mess - feeling paranoid and argumentative and being sick everywhere. My husband has (incredibly) stuck by me despite these nights, but I have never said something so hurtful before. We have a good relationship in general although sometimes we dont feel as ""fun"" anymore, we can run out of things to talk about other than work/kids.  
I dont know how to fix this situation other than top myself, though to be honest my husband and daughter would probably be better off without me putting them through this shit and generally not being able to be a normal human, they deserve so much better. Sorry this is a long rambly post, if you've made it to the end please share advice/thoughts/roasting/anything.

I have tried online dating a bit, but it seems that there are no such ""top"" women on these sites because these kind of women are always already in relationships and when one ends, they don't go on dating websites as they instantly and already have lots of options (men interested in them) without blinking an eye.

What should I do? Lots of women are interested in me but I want ""the one"", to fall in love, not just any relationship. It is very frustrating.

However, over the past four days it's become really real to me and I'm having trouble coping. On Monday, we found out he needed emergency eye surgery. He has diabetic retinopathy, and the treatments he's been receiving over the past few months caused even more troubles to arise in one of his eyes. On Thursday, we spent 12 hours in the hospital for his surgery. On Friday, he was in so much pain we had to go spend another 12 hour day in the hospital for surgery to fix the previous surgery. 

We were supposed to leave for a trip to Alaska today. We'd planned it out about a year ago. Together we moved several states away from my parents a year ago and this trip was supposed to be our chance to spend time with my family before the craziness that will be the wedding weekend since we haven't seen them in so long. 

I packed both of our bags last night. Hoping maybe there was a chance we could make it but he's in such pain right now I know we can't go. And I'm worried this will mean another trip to the hospital.

I'm sorry this is such a long ramble. I don't know what I'm asking. It's just starting to become real for me that I'm marrying someone with a chronic illness and it's never going away. The rest of my life is going to be worrying about him and waiting for him in the hospital for hours and cancelling plans at the last minute. 

If he hadn't gotten these eye treatments, he likely would have been blind by the end of the year. And it's likely we've just bought ourselves time. I just feel so exhausted and burnt out and hopeless. I spend so much time worrying about him and taking care of him and meanwhile I can't take care of myself and it's not like there's anyone else who can right now.

I know I need counseling, but our health insurance doesn't cover it and truthfully all these hospital visits are already bleeding us dry. I just don't know what to do. 

Sorry this is so long. And all over the place. I guess I'm just looking for some solidarity. Does anyone have any tips for partners of chronically ill people? How do I stay sane? How can I take care of myself when my entire life right now is centered around taking care of him?

108,glimmer-o-hope,[new],45,c7cy60,23,"So this happened a few months ago.

I had a good friend, in the past, we had been working together as he went through a divorce where his wife cheated and I had ups and downs, so we ran a lot together, sometimes hung out outside of work and got to know each other pretty well. Eventually we both moved jobs but kept a pretty solid friendship. There was a level of attraction there but I never really thought either of us was that interested in pursuing it as we had fundamental differences and I liked the friendship for what it was.

At some point he got a new girlfriend, I met her, she was easy to get on with and nice to me. Behind the scenes he confided he struggled to be alone and felt like the relationship was just a stop gap but then other times talked about it like he was serious and definitely acted on the surface like he was. I just listened as a friend, it didn't feel loaded or anything.

Then a few months ago, I was having a tough time and we met up, I was drunk already so we ended up drinking quite a lot, then he started putting his arm around me and made out with me. He started saying loads of stuff about having liked me for ages and giving high praise etc. It was slightly intoxicating but ultimately it kind of annoyed me and we finished the night early. I told him, I've met his girlfriend so she's not just a hypothetical person to me, I don't want to be in this position, I don't find cheating hot at all and it's about him and where he's at in life, not about me at all, and I don't want to lose the friendship so he needs to sort his shit out.

I just blanked out it happened to be honest and haven't spoken to him since. Today his girlfriend messaged me and I shit a brick when I saw the start of the message. Turns out she is organising a party for his birthday and has invited me. I feel like I just want to make an excuse and not go. It would feel like a betrayal of the friendship to tell her, so I don't want to. But I'd also like to know what other people would do, cuz I can't imagine another way of dealing with this realistically.

The thing is, her life at home is terrible and I feel bad for her. She lives with her parents. Her mother is too fat to move at all so she sits in a reclining chair all day long. She is a little overweight too but, by far, not as bad as her mom. Her dad has cancer and is working at revamping an apartment complex they own. She has to do so much for her family, so many chores and picking up groceries and doing errands for her mom. Her mom always talks about how the family is suffering which is really bringing her down. She has a brother and sister who don't live at home so she has to do everything. Her mom is controlling her life and my girlfriend doesn't like it but of course she loves her family so she always chooses to help them and be with them even when she doesn?t want to.

My family is the exact opposite. We are all fit and healthy. We are all positive and always love going out with friends and family and hosting people too. I grew up with a family like that and now having my girlfriend's family in my life it is a big sharp turn. My parents have met hers only two times and even when my parents invited them over her family is introverted, never goes out or has people over. My girlfriend also is in college right now and has a best friend suffering from depression. A few months ago her grandma died. There is a lot she is dealing with right now, I understand that, I just need a way to compromise. She can be really kind and happy and was like that all the time before the bad things came up. I need her to truly start controlling her own life and help her family on occasion but not always be at her house ""reporting for duty."" She talks to me about this all the time, and I want to help her, but listening her talk about all the negatives in her life brings me down a little bit. If I tell her she is doing this to me that might hurt her. If I try and distract her and make her think about positive things she always finds a way to bring up darkness. Her family is really bringing her down and that is getting in the way of our relationship. She needs to get her happiness back and not drag me into the darkness. I sort of do, but really don't, want to break up with her due to all these negatives she is putting on me. What should I do?

111,WillThrowThisAway11,[new],11,c7cuuo,10,"Hey reddit, wanted to get your opinion on something. Made this throwaway account just for this. Long post, very long, so get ready. TL;DR at the end.

&#x200B;

//Posts must include: - Ages, genders and relationship length// I'm 28, she's 21. I'm a man, she's a woman.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've been with my gf for almost 2 years now (give or take 3 months). At first she was the perfect mix of shy and smug, respectful, loving, everything was perfect. She still is some of those things. But things have changed.

&#x200B;

During the first few dates she described her ex as being awful, manipulative, he also made a deal with her that while they were together, she couldn't cheat but he could. She says it wasn't a relationship, as he didn't want her, but they did have sex, even a threesome, and did do stuff together, he kept her craving for more affection, and she craved it, accepted anything just to be with him.

&#x200B;

I want to stress this enough, in the early part of the relationship she talked about him like he was the devil.

&#x200B;

And now to the second part of the relationship, mid-way through. She starts warming up towards him, they start chatting, I'm confused over this, their chat sessions get even longer and more frequent. Then, on a random day when we were out shopping for groceries, she sees this book that has a cat on the cover, and the cat's name is the same as her ex's cat. She's excited over this, takes a picture and immediately send it to him, now he's interested too, asks her to get that book for him (he was gonna pay for it when they met). I was like, WTF? You want to meet this evil dude from your past, don't you think it's a bit inappropriate, now that we're in a relationship? She made a fuss about it saying it's just a book and she won't f\*\*k him. I don't remember if she actually gave him the book or not, since I protested quite heavily.

&#x200B;

Now to the next thing. A while after this, he gets a summer job as a bartender in a city that's a 2-3hr drive away. At this point, he's like an idol for her, she's very happy when she talks to him, like they're suddenly best friends. She then drops this: she talked to him about getting a job at the same bar, and tried to sell it to me like ""we'll have more money"" (even if there are jobs she could take right here), ""we'll see eachother each weekend, I promise, and it won't be that long, just 2-3 months!"". I was quite angry, I never expected her to change her attitude towards him like this. In the end she didn't go, as we had a big fight over this, that lasted several days.

&#x200B;

And another thing I just remembered, can't quite remember the timeline, if this was before or after the job thing: she loves going to the beach, and I never took her there, but we didn't plan any thip either, if anything, I would have had to plan it for it to take place, as she doesn't plan stuff in advance, she just goes, she's impulsive. (I had to save her ass once, she was in the middle of the city, with no money and an almost dead phone battery - like 5% or so, AT 1 AM no less -no public transport-, she somehow managed to call me and I sent her a taxi. This is her level of not planning. I'm the opposite.)

&#x200B;

Getting derailed here.

&#x200B;

So, she loves going to the beach. And then HER EX calls her, telling her he's going today, he has 1 seat left in the car, and asked if she wanted to go. At least she asked me first. But she still wanted to go, didn't even think how long they would stay, where would they sleep (in the same room??), anything. I told her she shouldn't go, so she didn't. And she was quite upset about it. If I was in her place, I wouldn't even have considered it. WTF.

&#x200B;

After a while, I had enough of her and her ex and I told her that I don't do this with my exes out of respect for her and for our relationship, and asked her to block her ex on fb. She did, but she didn't do it on all of his accounts, and she kelp talking with him, but way less frequently, and she'd hide it from me, to not get me upset.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't remember what happened after that, but something must have happened, because I remember getting really angry and telling her to block him on every account and never to talk to him again, if she wants our relationship to work. She says she never cheated, that she only needs him as a friend, as he can help her with her issues in life, with advice, all that. When I asked if she couldn't do that with me, since I helped her a lot with her life, she said it's not the same, as her ex knows stuff and has a better way of saying it, and I couldn't help her as well, that she needed it from him.

&#x200B;

Some time goes by, and I end up unemployed for 6 months, due to a shoulder injury that got worse at the last job, it got so bad that I couldn't work there anymore, even lifting a small box that weighted a lb would hurt like hell. Did some therapy, it got better, and it was a while until I could find a job that pays well and doesn't require physical labour. In this time, she grew even more dissatisfied. She lives with me, in my apartment, and we went 50-50 on the bills up until this point, then she had to fully support me financially (food and utility bills, mostly). I tried to limit costs as much as I could, so it wouldn't be a big burden for her.

&#x200B;

During this time, everyone keeps telling her that I profit off her, that I'm this lazy dude that lives off her money. Her mother wants us to break up (her mother being a cheating gold-digger, but that's another story), her ex and his current gf - he got a new gf, she and my gf are like best friends now - want us to break up, pretty much everyone is telling her she should break up with me, that I'm no good.

&#x200B;

I finally see some good job offers, and talk to a few people, go to interviews. Some of the offers flop, but there's this really nice one that I have to wait a week to get the answer, if I'm hired or not. I'm really happy, as I think I've made a good impression, and I'm sure I'll be hired, as I'm overqualified for it, also the pay is decent, really good for the amount of work. For what's mostly a desk job, it's really good, especially now, that I haven't been employed for 6 months.

&#x200B;

During the whole unemployment period, she would complain about the state of the apartment, the mess, and the fact that I don't bring in any money. The mess is her fault, I just got tired of cleaning up after her, so I don't. And it adds up, her dirty clothes are everywhere, and there were a couple of days when I couldn't take it anymore and gathered all her clothes from the floor, the different rooms, and from the bathroom, and piled them up on a chair, then I cleaned my (our) room properly, now that her clothes weren't everywhere, and I also cleaned the kitchen, bathroom and hallway. It wasn't long until her clothes were everywhere again. And not just clothes, dirty dishes, food packaging... she says she can't do it, that it's way too much to clean, so she doesn't. And I only clean the mess that I do, not hers. So, the house is dirty and messy constantly.

&#x200B;

Now, with 4 days to go 'till I get the answer from that good job, she goes to visit her grandma. I take her part of the way there, and she was supposed to come back later. It's getting late in the day and she's not back, no messages, so I call her, wanting to know what's up, she says she's not coming home, and that we need a break (not the first time this comes up in our conversations, and this time it was related to money, and my lack of a job - told her she didn't have to do this now, as in a few days I'll most likely be employed, but she didn't want to hear that), that everyone keeps telling her we should break up so she's considering it. That hurt me, since I am emotionally invested in her, it hurt like a loved family member just died. We talked for a bit, at around 1 AM she hops in a UBER and comes back, saying she shouldn't have left, that she loves me and can't stay away. After this stunt, seeing how much it hurt me for her to leave, I allowed her to talk to her ex, and at this point she revealed that she in fact kept talking to him when I thought she blocked him. It didn't matter, she was back, so I didn't care anymore.

&#x200B;

I had some savings that to me were quite significant, we wasted that last month because she can't manage her money, and I kept lending her from my savings, 'till they went dry. But it's ok now, since I'm finally employed, and can start saving up again for my shoulder surgery and for some redecorating she wanted. I told her she can give back my money whenever she can, even if it takes her a few months, it's ok.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, after reading all this, what do you think of my situation? Is this a good relationship? Should I continue it, or try to end it? I've always gotten way too attached in relationships, and it can cloud my judgement. At the moment, it would be very painful for me if she was gone. But the thing with her ex... it bothers me. I don't know. I focused mostly on the bad things here because those are the ones I need resolved, but there are plenty of good things in the relationship, normal stuff, that every relationship has. I guess I'm just too attached to her and don't want to be alone. But at the same time, it eats at me.

112,morxiana,[new],3,c7cukw,1,"I've never posted here before soo bear with me. Background info: I'm 20F, I have a small crush on this guy who's single (22M), I also have a boyfriend, been dating for 2 years (20M) - I'm not planning to act on my crush fyi so please don't make it a big deal (since I feel a little bad about it already). That being said, the guy sits next to me at work (I work in a university lab), we've recently become friends since I started working here a little under a month ago. Even though I have a boyfriend I'm sort of socially inept, naive and oblivious about things especially cause this guy is a super confident person and is the exact opposite of my boyfriend. He sends a lot of mixed signals so I really don't know what to think. 

There's a bit of a twist though: I'm working in a different country and I'm American, he used to study in America and he super idolizes the time he spent there. I think he initially took interest in me because I'm American and therefore share common interests, and is the reason why we're friends now.

\- Some of my coworkers gave me extra cookies one day and I wasn't feeling hungry, so I left them on his desk and a day later he randomly comes up to me as I'm working and asks if I have any extra cookies 

\- One of my coworkers once asked me privately if we were going out, a lot of people have asked if we're dating since we're so close

\- He introduced me to all his closest friends the first week I came here. He also asks me to dinner occasionally and asks me a ton of questions about my life in the U.S., from school to family to the place I live. 

\- If I make any little mistakes he likes to harp on it and tease me about it for the rest of the day 

\- He came to my dorm room to ask for something and ended up staying for an hour. Another time he came to my room another time with beer and we ended up drinking and talking about life for a while. This was super announced and he just texted me randomly one night if I wanted to drink with him. Since I live alone atm, it felt a little too intimate to be friendly 

\- He teases and pushes me a lot about making a Tinder to meet up with new guys ""as friends"" but keeps reminding me that the only thing guys want on Tinder is having sex. He keeps talking about how I should go on dates/hook up with different guys that he introduces me to, and I usually respond with like ""ew stfu no"" and he laughs, so I think he gets a kick out of my reactions. He always talks about this in a really teasing manner so I'm not sure how serious he is about me actually going out with a stranger.

\- He brags about himself a lot to me about the girls he's met over the years, like how he made out with one girl in a club or which girls has a crush on him in the past. He also found one of my friends on Facebook and talks about how attractive she is and how I should introduce her to him. 

\- He asked me a lot of personal questions, like if I watch porn, have sex with my boyfriend, etc. Idk if it's out of curiosity or something 

\- He usually initiates conversations first, both over text and in person. He seems to trust me a lot to discuss his life dilemmas (i.e., life after graduating university, how all his friends are in relationships and he's not, etc) 

\- He once mentioned what my boyfriend would think of a guy (himself) who's super ""hands-on"" around his girlfriend. 

Sorry ik this is a lot but these are the major things that have happened so far. Half of these would tell me that he's not interested but sometimes I have the gut feeling that he's implying something. I also can't tell when he's serious because he jokes around a lot, or if this is all just normal behavior for him, so I just wanted your opinions on what this all means.

But he was claiming he needed a restraining order. So idk why he waited until when blocked him. I immediately blocked her when she found out about me. Everyone told me its because ""I knew I was sleeping with her man and I got scared"" but that's not true. 

He posted one pic of us back in March.  But it didnt seem like a romantic picture.  I was in his music video with my friends and it's a pic of me and him from the video with the caption ""thank you for all you do ?""  and I responded to the pic saying ""of course mi amor"" and he responded with an inside joke from a tv show that had nothing to do with anything really.  

His family posted a pic of us from memorial day. His sister and his mother posted it. It was a pic of me, his sister, his bro in law, his son and his niece and nephew.  He didnt like or comment on either one! He didnt post the pics himself. And not only that his family posted the pic but dont even think enough of me to add me on any social media sites. But I felt they approved the relationship because they posted that pic and his mom captioned it his daughter in law. If I comment on his pics he doesnt respond or even like the comment.  He used to. He Djs at a night club. I went last night with him and people recorded videos of the club and you could see me dancing beside him at the dj booth like right beside him. He wasnt paying me any attention at all while I was dancing beside him in the video. Yeah I know he was working but still. The video just made me look stupid. Hes also been posting old things from years ago when would book shows and it makes me feel like hes not haoog with his current life because hes been posting old things.

Lately I noticed he followed a few of his exes on instagram. Even an ex who made him promise never to contact her because she has a new gf. He cant follow the ex I mentioned above because she blocked him. The other girls didnt follow him back. But idk why if you have a gf you would even follow his exes?

 We've never talked about being in a relationship or putting a label, we were just together and it was going great. We still hang out and are just as close as before without any of the affectionate touching and I miss it, I miss having her. We've talked about it and she says she is attracted to me, still wants me, still likes me and still wants to be with me but just can't be because she has a hard time with her emotions. She hasn't had the best experiences with her previous relationships so I can understand her shying away from her emotions or accepting them. It's just all too difficult to come to terms with after being with her romantically and then losing all of that in a matter of seconds out of nowhere.

I've asked her if she would like space, if she didn't want to hang out or talk as much but she says she doesn't want anything to change. It has been a month and a half since then and it hurts to hold back my feelings for her, to not be able to express myself to her and to kiss her and hold her like I once did. We talked the day before yesterday about it all again and she still says the same thing, that she still likes me and she wants us to try again to be together but can't tell me when.

I've asked our closest friends what to do and I've gotten both ""if she's worth the wait, wait."" And ""Give up, move on. If she wants you, she wants you."" But it hurts to wait and I don't want to give up.

116,master_of_downvotes,[new],6,c7c6zq,0,"Its 4:20am in the morning. I'm at a separate hotel and the amount of stress in my stomach has kept me up to this point. I'm hoping this post helps me figure out my thoughts and confidently walk in a direction. Replaying Halsey - nightmare for the entire night has certainly not helped.

I went on a business trip this week and my fiancee, who we will call Britney was going to join and her idea to invite her gay guy friend who we will call Jack. Jack invites a not so relevant friend in this story, Cory.

In the 3 years I've been with Britney, she's defined really strict boundaries implicitly and explicitly. I'm her first lover so it was very understandable when she got upset or was insecure in many moments through out the relationship. Before meeting her I was three years single, I was kind of a hoochy mama but I've tried more effort than you can ever imagine to be careful because little interactions with other people would light that firecracker off.

Back to today, her friend Jack is a very touchy guy. To no fault of Jack's own, he's a very open guy, and very free love spirit, so it's very natural for him to just touch her. Her arms, small kisses, etc... we were coming back from hanging out and he's rubbing her leg. And I couldn't contain myself, I took her leg and his arm and threw them away from each other. It was a severe overreaction realizing it could have been solved by just communicating.

But her response was to try rationalizing that he's gay (which people aren't fucking binary especially when you are open minded like he is). And I've gone through relationships through cheating and it wasn't so much the jealousy, but the fact a very well defined boundary that was put on me was crossed by her, and instead of her understanding me, she tried to defend his and her actions. Jack and Cory tried to explain to me how I'm some super wonderful fucking guy and she absolutely loves me more than anything and not to worry. And to make it worse we planned this trip where she flies home Monday and I fly home tomorrow.

That's when the stress in my stomach sit in. I left our airbnb, I waited at the park, I went out for a few drinks, I checked myself into another hotel.

So where does this all stand? I'm in another state, I'm in another hotel, I'm shaking from anxiety, I missed her the entire business trip and never got quality time with her, I'm crying which I've never done since my dog passed a number of years ago, and I know I've initiated crossroads I cannot return from. And I know I'm not thinking clear of how to approach tomorrow regardless how many hours I've thought about it. Do I face Jake and Cory, do I face just Britney, do I just fly home alone tomorrow without saying anything.

118,throwway8272,[new],29,c7c625,54,"My boyfriend (37) and I (27) have been dating for 4.5 years. He is very very good to me. He lets me do what I want, trusts me, and cares for me. I feel the same way for him as well.   


However, our interests do not align. I am more adventurous than he is. He is content with staying home and doing nothing or playing with his phone day in day out. He also likes fashion and he spends majority of the time behind the screen looking at fashion-related pictures and blogs. I like hiking, taking long drives and exploring, and trying new things. This has been a problem for me for a long time and I've spoken to him about it but I feel like its going nowhere.   


Also, since being together, he has not planned one single trip out of town for us. Not one. On his birthday two years ago I took him on a weekend getaway trip to a different city. He politely told me that while he appreciated the thought, he preferred a gift or to give him the money (I took him on a trip and bought him a birthday gift that year). I felt really disappointed at the end of our trip; I thought spending time with me, eating, and experiencing something new was enough.  


He also likes to spend most of his money on fashion. 1) I'm not attracted to how he presents himself but have tolerated it for many years, and 2) he recklessly spends WAY too much money on fashion. I'm not going to go into details with this because I am so frustrated with this topic. Let's just say he could have money for a home deposit by now if he didn't spend all his money on fashion. I get it, you can do what you want with your money but the rate he is spending his money on these items is irrational.

&#x200B;

Another thing. He rarely is interested in hanging out with my friends. I try to be involved with him and his friends but it's not the same for him. He doesn't really try to get along with my friends. I feel like when my friends invite me and my boyfriend to an event, I always say ""I'll come!  we will see if bf wants to go"" because majority of the time he doesn't want to go. I go alone majority of the times. 

&#x200B;

I find it hard finding hobbies that we like. If I ask him to do something I like, it just feels like I'm dragging him along because he doesn't seem enthusiastic. I'm honestly sick of living my life so dull.

&#x200B;

Besides for the above mentioned, he is good and patient with me.

I love him but I don't know what to do.

She continues to talk to me about her dating life and what she is going through, and recently she has discovered that she is a lesbian. Taking all of this into account it would be down-right unacceptable to ask her anything in a romantic nature, yet I still love her fully. I wake up many mornings from dreams where I simply spend time with her, just to realize that my dreams are just that, dreams, and so they will remain. I have resorted to cutting myself and my arteries because of my hate for my pathetic life and how I can't have what I desire most. This has bothered me for too long and has affected my entire life and I can't stop loving her, everything about her. I need to find a way to stop, so I ask: how do I get rid of my feelings so that I can live healthily and happily?

120,AnnaPup,Relationships,3,c7bpsr,1,"So I?ve been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years, but have been friends with him for 5. He?s never been a wildly emotional person, but he recently said something that worries me. For some context, he has always had a pretty rocky relationship with his mother, who I am told has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder among other things. She is a very selfish person and told his father, him and his siblings that she was leaving, only to later admit that she did it to make his father treat her better in their marriage. I?ve met both his father and his mother, and he is very very similar to his father in that they are both very logical and family oriented. This caused a very large rift in the house, with her and her daughters apparently always against his father and sons. There are many incidences of her being a far less than adequate mother, and my boyfriend (from what he says) often felt unimportant and not like a priority to her when he was younger and during this. Though she eventually did come back, the real issue came last summer, when she attempted to commit suicide. Her other son found her, but my boyfriend is the one who had to call the police and help her. It was a terrible situation.

These days my boyfriend often refuses to talk about her, as I know she makes him very angry. His parents are really separated now, and he has cut her out completely and has not really spoken to her since. I know he plans on never having a relationship with her, which I understand. Here?s where the issue is:

Yesterday he became upset about something unrelated, which I think led to him being in a poor enough mood to talk about her. He went over all the things that she did to him, saying ?Think about every bad thing that one person can do to another, and she?s done it to me, besides sexual.? Just about how she didn?t care about him nearly as much as his other siblings, about how she always put him down. I forgot to mention earlier, but the fight that actually led to her suicide attempt was with him. I know she has hurt him immeasurably. Yesterday, however, he had points where he mentioned talking about putting himself in a position where she could try to hurt him in order to get her put in prison. His lack of self concern startled me, but it?s something he?s mentioned briefly before. What really bothered me was that he talked about how he had heard her one day while she was picking up his sisters (not that long ago) and that he had seen a baseball bat and imagined how easy it would be to just hit her until she stopped moving, and this entire problem would be over (the custody issue too). It was a bit graphic, but I tried to just listen without really commenting. I would never ever peg him as a violent person, though he honestly has mentioned something like that with her before. This time just seemed far more extreme, especially after not talking about her with me for such a long time. 
I feel like when I suggest solutions, I come off as far too pushy, because I think he?s just venting and not really looking for solutions. I don?t want to make him feel like he can?t talk to me, but what he said is a bit much. Is there anything I can do specifically to help him? Should I just not bring it up, or push him to talk more? 

He has this strange perception of her, where he feels he knows her better than anyone and can predict her actions better than anyone. It comes off like her actions surpass anything that any normal person would do, and are 10x as terrible (don?t get me wrong, she is a truly terrible person and he definitely knows her well, I just think that it?s a bit too much to assume that she?s not just another shitty human). I want to suggest therapy to him, as it?s something his dad talked about (all his siblings are in it now), but I don?t know how to do it without seeming pushy, or how to word it right. Realistically, I?m not sure I could stay here if he put himself in a position to either ?sacrifice? himself to compromise her position or hurt her himself. I wish he had more concern for his own future because he is incredibly smart and bright. I don?t think he will go through with anything, but the fact that he thinks about something like that at all worries me, and I really think he needs additional help with it that I?m not trained to give. I?m also worried that if I bring it up again, he is going to make excuses and talk about how it?s not that serious and try to shut it down. 

I think I?m going to wait a few days to see how I think I should approach this, but any help at all is welcome. If you have additional questions just ask, I probably didn?t cover everything I wanted because it?s such a long story with a lot of context. I?m also sorry about any errors, as I?m on mobile and it?s very early where I am. Thanks so much!

Things were not going well between us, so she decided to broke up. I didn?t like most of her behaviors anyways (always screaming during an argument and throwing things on the floor sometimes).

She left our house and made me promise I?ll see her often and that I?ll not disappear out of the blue. She asked me if I could come to her house sometimes and sleep with her. She kept asking all this stuff.

I was expecting a period of me and her staying apart, but still seeing each other often and see if we could fix it. After all, she made me promise it and I was okay with that.

After all the promises... she started to do the exact opposite of everything she made me promise. It?s been 4 months.

She stopped texting me almost completely. She never invited me to her apartment (not even to eat something). She never want me to see more than a couple of hours per week. She?s completely cold and distant in everything.

I?m guessing there?s another guy involved and I even know who he?s.

The thing that makes me angry is this: she made me promise all of this while she wasn?t sure on how things were going to turn out for her. As soon as she saw things were going well between her and the new guy, she simply left me alone.

Even now she texts me some sweet stuff sometimes, like ?I miss you? or crap like that, just to keep me in the loop.

I?ve suffered so much because of this and still am. Mainly because I wasn?t expecting she was going to be completely out of my life like this.

Things were always the best but we got a long well and had a lot of matching interests. Long story short due to a build up of frustrations and lack of communication we broke up and went our separate ways.

As of last year she reached out to me and we reconnected. It was nice seeing her again and it was like there hadn't even been any bad blood between us and we fell back into our old way of acting which each other fairly easily. 

This is also where things started to get messy as we ended up hooking up a couple of times. I wasn't aware she was dealing with a on again off boyfriend during this time and when they got back together I was ghosted. This should have been a big eye opener for me to just not pursue any chance of me and my ex working out. 

I tried to move on again during this time but again after a few months and I guess another break up she reached out to me. The same situation happened again where we hit it off, hooked up then I'd get ghosted. 

This leads us to yesterday where after coming back into contact again I decided to tell her that I still had feelings for her and I can't keep up this weird friendship we have. Well as you can imagine from me writing this that didn't work out.

I know this is probably a positive step to take in my life but I just feel like I wasted so much time, I don't blame her people are people and I'm just not someone she wanted. I feel lost and don't know where to go from here.

*TL:DR - I'm a 34 yo gay mom of a 4.5yo hoping to find a healthy setup with my girlfriend and the father of my kid.* 

&#x200B;

Here's my situation, I'll try to be brief and I don't mind diving into more detail if asked. So here goes:

I'm 34 and have a 4.5 yo little boy. Although his dad and I are separated now (Not officially), we still share a home, (we live in separate rooms). That way, our kid doesn't feel deprived of either parent. Generally, it's worked great since he's a great dad and they have a close relationship. Also, I wouldn't want to deprive my son of his father's presence. We're friends too, so no animosity there. (We separated because I arrived at my truth, that I am gay and being in a relationship with a woman makes me much happier and is what I want).

My girlfriend and I have a dream ( a fantasy I wish for) of having a home together, and now the fate of our relationship resides on what our living situation may look like once we are all back in the same country. She and I are doing long distance overseas - it's HARD.

When my kid and I go back to LA, I would ideally want to start building on my dream, but I also need to have my son's best interests at heart, and taking that decision to live separately from his dad (who'll also move to LA) right away isn't a decision for me to take on all our behalf. It's not forever, we just need this transition time - and if we're meant to be together, we are already a family, all of us. Her included. I know I can't force my girlfriend down that path with me (how I wish she'd just be ok about it), but now I risk losing the love of my life because she doesn't see this setup as something she wants in her life, even just for that transition phase. She wants to build a life with me and my son, not necessarily LIVE in the same home as his dad too. She argues cases where he could be living down the hall, or close by. That in its own is a setup I can imagine too, but it takes away from moments my son can share with his dad, and it doesn't bode well with his dad knowing he won't get his morning cuddles and candid moments of bonding and love.

My girlfriend and I have broken up several times because of this issue, and I stay insisting on us living under the same roof, she insists she can't - then we break again. No resolve. She and I haven't spoken in 2 long months and last night we finally spoke and I can breathe again. I know I found the love of my life, and I don't want to lose her again, and I need a plan of action.

124,turnipfood,[new],2,c7bdb6,2,"I \[20F\] have been with my boyfriend \[31M\] for a year, long distance. I'm living with him for the summer and he went out of town for work, meaning I'm in a country where I don't speak the native language and don't know anyone in the city for a week.

&#x200B;

He went out last night (he works in entertainment) for about 12 hours, getting home at 6 am. I was super upset, not because he went out, but because we haven't gone out to do anything that hasn't involved friends (so like three dinners, and we have not gone out drinking or parting at all) the entire month I've been here because we have been working or talking through my relationship (I will grant it's my fault that it takes longer than it needs to because I'm not the best about opening up).

&#x200B;

I expressed that I was upset about the fact that he felt he could go out for 12 hours, when I told him I 1. Would not go visit my father (who also coincidentally lives in this country) so that I could do work, to give us more quality time. 2. Agreed to have the days free that he wasn't filming so that we could FT through his work and I could help. 3. Agreed that I would not go into a coworking space that I was invited to (which would really be good for my startup and ability to make friends, because I have made 0 friends here yet) if he had the day off. Also, I know he would not be chill if I did the same thing, although the situations are way different and it's not in my industry to party in that way, however I am the younger one (I might say more in partying age) and I'm really craving the opportunity to go out and be able to act my age.

&#x200B;

His days off were yesterday and today. I slept through yesterday because I was sick and couldn't help him, when I found out he was out so late, I also got upset because that meant there's no way he would work today, since he basically got home the time I woke up. He pulled the card that he was upset that I couldn't help because I was sick and that he let me sleep without complaining, that we hadn't had quality time because we have spent a few days arguing, that the last text I sent him was to ""have fun,"" (because I think he should, I just didn't think it would be 12 hours), and that it was important for him to network (which I agree with, but again 12 hours???).

&#x200B;

Anyway, the conversation this morning ended with my apologizing for being irrational (I don't feel like I was, but I didn't want to have hours of conversation), and him saying a lot of loving things towards me (as he always does).

This is how a lot of our arguments end. It's taken a lot for me to open up and tell him that I'm upset about things, but I don't feel like I can when it always ends this way.  It makes me feel like I cannot express things that upset me because he always views them as irrational and that he always uses the fact that his kind and loving language means I should be upset less about the things he does that I don't like.

&#x200B;

Am I being immature? Am I being irrational? How do I, someone who is really self conscious about expressing my feelings, have better conversations than this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: He woke up at 2 PM, hungover--we both almost never drink. Asked me a lot if I was okay, kept telling me he loved me, and kept asking if I was mad at him, did not apologize.

We get along very well and have plenty of similar interests. Since we're both broke students, we only get to see each other every few months for a few days at a time. 

&#x200B;

When we first found out that we were going to be moving away from each other, we didn't have a set plan for the future of our relationship, but we both knew we wanted to continue the relationship and agreed we wanted to see how it goes throughout our time at college.  In the event that we were still together when we were finished with school I told him I'm that since I am very close to my family I was not willing to move away from my hometown, and he said that was fine, and when he is finished with school in 2021 he would be willing to move to my city to be with me. At the time we had only been dating for 5 months so I didn't think much of it but was eager to see where this relationship went. 

&#x200B;

Our relationship has become more serious throughout the 11 months we've been living in different cities, and just recently we had a more serious conversation about the future. He told me he wants to be with me no matter where that is and is 100% down to leave his hometown for me after he gets his degree. Even though it's 2 years in the future and even if our relationship has gotten a little more serious, I'm getting cold feet and anxious about him moving in with me. I don't know if it's the distance that is causing it and the fact that I only physically see him every few months, but I noticed my interest in him has decreased within the past few months. I feel like we hardly have anything to talk about and we haven't had an intriguing conversation in a long time. Lately most conversations go along the lines of:

""How are you?""

""I'm good, you?'

""Nice, I'm good too""

""Cool""

""Yeah""

This is how the majority of our conversations go even when we're visiting each other. It's really concerning to me that we can't seem to have an interesting convo no matter how hard I've been trying. I've told him this, and he's tried, but the conversations we have (or lack there of) still seem to reset way too often with ""How are you?"" and ends up getting nowhere again. These lifeless conversations aren't doing anything for me and since we live so far away I don't know of any other methods to keep interest in the relationship besides conversation.

&#x200B;

Another thing I've noticed is how appealing other guys are becoming to me (no, I would NEVER cheat) but I don't know if it's a sign that I'm becoming more and more unsure in my relationship. Also, he hates selfies so I don't even get to see him at all when we're apart while he asks for some of me all the time. What makes it worse is he tells me all the time that he believes I am his soulmate, but the thing is, I am his first serious girlfriend and I'm afraid he's just saying those things because he has no other relationship to compare ours to.

&#x200B;

He does treat me so so well and he is such a kind, funny, and genuine person. I really do care for him so deeply, but I just don't know if it's solely the distance that is causing this friction in our relationship or if this is just how our relationship will be even if we move in together.

About a year ago my friend got a girlfriend and stopped texting me. He wasn't that great at texting in the first place and made me feel like he didn't want to write me sometimes.
And when he got his girlfriend he completely stopped.
When I asked him why we talked and everything was okay, we met up and it was normal.
After that nothing. Again.

When I told him I felt like he didn't care about our friendship he denied it and claimed that he did.
After that I said some hurtfil stuff and he said some hurtful stuff.
It endet by him telling me he just didn't want to write me. After we finished talking he deleted my number (and I his, but I still have the convo in the messenger)
We didn't have any contact, wich was not hard as we both never saw each other (different schools, friends)

I try to be an example, I try to guide him through different ways he can approach things and I never get angry or minimize the things he says. Still he is having a really hard time, he can understand what I'm saying is true but it's hard actually going through with any of it.

129,advicethrowaway2876,Non-Romantic,12,c7b6db,2,"My grandmother passed away earlier this month. She hasn't really been herself since my grandfather passed away a couple of years ago and had mostly been living with me and my immediate family for that time. We had recently helped her move into an assisted care facility at the recommendation of her doctor since she kept falling down and injuring herself as well as a slew of other health problems.

&#x200B;

My cousin was pretty much raised by my grandparents. Her mother left her when she was young and her father abandoned her and her brother to start a new family down the street. She actually lived with me and my parents when she was younger for a while as well. My grandma was probably the only real stable maternal figure she's known in her life.

&#x200B;

When my grandmother passed, we called to let her know and tell her about the funeral arrangements. She told us that she could not come. I initially thought that this was because of money troubles (her husband is the sole breadwinner for their family and they're expecting a new baby so I could understand if money was tight). I wanted to offer to buy tickets for her because I felt like she would regret missing the funeral and didn't want her to feel like money was stopping her from attending something meaningful to her. My mother talked to her on the phone again and she said that she could not come because her husband could not get the days off. This seemed weird to me because even if her husband couldn't come, she still could? After all, she's the one who's related to the deceased. And she's not yet far along enough where flying would be a problem. But I tried to empathize with her. Maybe she wanted the security of traveling with your spouse during pregnancy. Okay, fine.

&#x200B;

However, literally days after the funeral, she posted photos of herself at some water park/resort with her husband and child. I saw the update on my way back from cleaning out my grandmother's apartment and immediately felt livid. It wasn't that she didn't have the money or that she didn't want to travel without her husband. She skipped the funeral because she didn't want it to ruin her vacation plans. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying that people aren't allowed to live their lives after a death in the family but this just seemed so callous. Seeing her post gleeful photos on vacation tagged #makingmemories and #havingfun just made me incredibly upset that my grandmother spent literal decades taking care of her and she couldn't even be bothered to show up to the funeral. Wouldn't the normal and decent thing to do here have been to cancel the vacation and show up to the funeral instead? She could drive 4+ hours to a water park/resort but she couldn't take a 4 hour plane ride to see her grandma for the last time ever?

&#x200B;

She hasn't mentioned my grandmother passing on social media or called me and my family to see if the funeral went well. I understand not being able to make it because of money. I understand not being able to make it because you want to have your spouse with you because you're pregnant. What I don't understand is consciously making the choice to skip the funeral of a woman who raised you because you had planned to go on vacation. At the very least, keep your vacation photos off of Facebook when you know that the funeral just happened. I could excuse this kind of behavior from a teen, but she's a grown adult - she's older than me! Between this and her dad (my uncle) showing up and ransacking my grandmother's apartment for valuables after the funeral, I'm about ready to cut this side of the family out from my life forever.

Last weekend my girlfriend and her sisters were talking about how bad they felt for their cousin. Apparently his dad flipped out because his girlfriend he brought home was a black girl. They said how they invited him to come over to their place to catch up. I opened my mouth saying I could have a chat to him because I know what it's like bringing home a person of a different race to not receptive parents. They said her name was Iris.

My best friend has been with this girl for a year and a half. It's his first relationship. The bond between them is extremely fragile. They fight a lot and 90 percent of the time It's him who's apologizing. Lately she has been manipulating his behavior a lot. She already dumped him twice and patched up again, said some really mean things about him and his family in the process. My friend however values her more than his self respect. She doesn't let him talk about the relationship to anyone(including me). So, I have very little insight on the details. He doesn't tell me whats wrong when there's a fight between them. She recently blamed him for giving me so much space in his personal life (She knows that I dislike her). I can clearly see multiple red flags and he wouldn't listen to me. His judgement is extremely clouded from all the drama. They fight verbally very frequently and it gets aggressive.

133,anonimirl,[new],3,c7b05h,1,"Hello, I've met my boyfriend in college (we both were groupmates, so we had classes together). We started talking to each other more and more, we started off as friends at first because we wanted to know each other better, we enjoyed each other company so after a month of knowing each other he decided to ask me out on date, I kindly agreed.

And our first date was really great, huge chemistry, everything felt like a dream.

Everything seemed great at first, lots of physical contact, lot of time spent together, we enjoyed every minute we spent together, even silence felt like a bliss for us, kind of lovery dovey relationship.

But as we spent every day in college together some of red flags started to show off:

\- I had some terrible acne back then, of course I tried to hide it using make up as much as possible but he somehow noticed and loudly, when everyone in our class could hear (so you have acne huh?) I felt so terrible after him loudly asking me this because I had huge complex about it, I literally wanted to cry because he could ask me this personally but not loudly when everyone could hear it)

\-He was really stressed before some test, I've asked him some question regarding some task before test, he yelled again, when everyone in our class could hear (I don't know the answer!"")

\-He started ignoring me playing some game on his smartphone, some of my groupmates noticed that and told my boyfriend ""it's not very nice to ignore your girlfriend like this"", he literally laughed it off and kept playing it, I got pissed and told him that our groupmate was right by telling him it's not nice to ignore me like that.

\-He laughed at me when I was literally emotionally down, crying because of shitty first day at my first job, like it was nothing, like I just made a huge deal out of it but I never cry over nonsenses or over-dramatize things.

I was still living in these lovey dovey moments I mentioned before, so I tried ignoring these red flags as much as possible by lying myself it was just bad moments which happens in every relationship, so I tried to brush it off and keep living in my own fairytale land where everything is perfect.

Well of course that fairytale land slowly turned into shithole land when we started fighting more and more often over small things because it was probably that moment when I started losing my respect to him so every little thing he did started pissing me off, I started picking up fights, he always ended up apologizing with flowers and dates to show me how much he loves me and how much he doesn't want to lose me.

I gave him a chance because he started learning from his past mistakes he did, he apologized me for all these things he did in the past really sincerely, he got much better at communication, we seriously tried to work hard together to solve these problems to make our relationship as great as it used to be in the beginning. But well no matter how hard we tried to solve these problems, they still appeared and appeared again and again, we ended in endless spiral of trying to solve these same problems because the cause of it was my lack of respect to him.

And it's still a problem which makes me feel like a terrible person for not being able to forgive him for these things he did one year ago even beside that he is treating me now really well.

I'm also reading a lot of books or articles about psychology and this quote"" ?When we let go and stop dragging the pain and past, we free ourselves of dead weight and allow our hearts to heft the good stuff?the stuff that makes our journey lighter, easier, and more meaningful.? makes me feel even shittier person for not being able to let go this past.

tldr; I'm really sorry for long post and some grammar mistakes as English is not my native language.

So how the hell should I be able to regain my trust back to my boyfriend if now my boyfriend is treating me well, sincerely apologized me for these things he did to me in the past?

A week ago I asked him 'what we are' and we had a long chat, he told me he really likes me and is only seeing me, only wants to see me, but right now he doesn't want a relationship. He says he hasn't been dating anyone else, but he's not looking to jump into anything. He says he 'can't predict the future' and that he knows if we spend more time together our feelings will probably grow more, but he doesn't feel ready to commit to something as of right now. I asked him if it was ME that he didn't want a relationship with, or just in general, and he said just generally he doesn't want one.

&#x200B;

I'm not stupid, and I'm trying not to get any false hope from this conversation, I'm trying to take his word for it and BELIEVE him that he doesn't want a relationship (which isn't what I asked him for btw, I asked him what he thinks we currently are and he said 'seeing each other exclusively'). The thing that makes it tricky for me is that I recently got a gut feeling that he's ..not 'the one', he's close but there is something missing. Because of this realisation, part of me wants to keep seeing him, knowing that it is somewhat casual, and also go on dates with other people on the side (no sex). He treats me with respect and I enjoy having the 'coupley' arrangement without committing myself either, but I'm obviously worried that in the long term I could regret it if I get more attached. The goal would be to go on dates with others to keep myself in check, and potentially take it further with one of them.

&#x200B;

Has anyone been in this situation before? How did it work out? My friends are saying that it's risky to keep seeing him, and others are telling me to say that he needs space and not speak for a couple weeks, to see if it will 'force' him into realising how much he likes me. I'm not sure about that either. The internet so far seems to think the worst thing I can do is just keep seeing him.

136,homewrecker1717,[new],4,c7axv3,0,"My ex and I dated for a year and a half, two and a half years ago. We were each others firsts in almost every respect, and it was really hard on her after I broke up with her. We always got along, even before we dated, and so a year after we broke up, we reconnected by her calling me drunk and telling me that she still loves me, and she loves me more than her current boyfriend.

Somehow we kept talking after that, and eventually, last fall, we finally hung out in person again, albeit with mutual friends present. Since then, we've become much much better friends. We were each other's best friend, for sure. With this came talking about feelings. Although she got a new boyfriend after we broke up (they've been together for two years now), I've jumped between multiple short-term relationships, never finding someone I really connected with.

This naturally led to both of us admitting we wished we could get back together, but can't because she lives with him. She, however, consistently complains about how much she dislikes him while also affirming she still loves him. She told me he gaslights her but it ""isn't a big deal"".

We got closer and closer until one time we were hanging out and she decided to snuggle with me for a couple minutes before we went to sleep. That snowballed later into us going on a weekend vacation alone, where we made out. This was a month ago, and we've made out on multiple occasions since, went on a date, held hands and dry humped.

Recently she told me she didn't want to stop this with me but chose to stay with her current boyfriend. I was under the assumption she would leave him and at some point we'd get back together, if not right away. I felt very naive and used, so we discussed no longer talking and decided that was the best choice.

My dilemma is, she's blatantly lied to her boyfriend for months about the fact she's cheating on him. Should I tell him, knowing it'd probably ruin their relationship? Is it even my choice to tell him? I'm leaning towards not telling him, and giving her the option to tell him or not since she clearly wants to stay with him, at least for now.

My (42F) mom (73F) passed away two months ago.  Last year she decided she could not live alone any more, and was looking into assisted living. She had a long term illness but was not close to death. I expected we would have 5 years at least. My husband (43M married 7 years) and I offered her the lower level of our home so that she could be with her grand kids and near my sister.  He told me he never believed she would agree to come to live at our house. She did.

&#x200B;

My mom moves in and things are OK at first. She was mentally all there, but severely limited physically. She spent most of her time in the house and had a to-do list for me every day when I got home from work, even though my husband was home after 2pm. He would not go speak to her at all. The only thing he would do is ask her if she was coming upstairs for dinner. My kids would go down and play with her and she liked that.

&#x200B;

About 4 weeks after she moved in, she got the flu and ended up in the ICU for 10 days. They had us making phone calls at 3AM telling family she was going to die. They told us if she survived, she would have brain damage. I slept at the hospital for 2 days. She survived and was able to come home. She had more needs than before but my husband still would not talk to her. When I asked him to help, he said he was busy with the kids and was tired. Note for the record - I was also tired.

&#x200B;

She lived with us for five more months, hospitalized 4 more times before she passed.

&#x200B;

Here is the event that is sticking with me, and I don't know what to deal with: We had installed emergency buttons in her space in case she needed help right away. It rings a doorbell upstairs. She used one the night she went to the hospital the first time. This happened on a different day. On this occasion it was the middle of the day on the weekend. My husband was taking a nap. I was doing laundry, kids were playing in the living room. My mom was having trouble breathing, needed to go to the hospital, and rang her bell. Our laundry is in the garage, so I did not hear it. My three-year old shouted to me, but I could not hear her, and my kids shout to me a lot, and I told her I would answer her in a few minutes. I was in the garage for another 3-5 minutes when I went inside and asked my daughter what she needed. She said she heard Grandma's bell, and that is when I learned about it. Husband told me later that he heard the bell, but knew I was around, so ignored it, and went back to sleep. I told him I expected him to answer EVERY TIME she rang the bell, and we left it at that. He did not apologize. I couldn't process it at the time because I was caring for my mom, my kids, and still going to work. I've been able to process it and I am so angry at him and he doesn't know why. He doesn't think he did anything wrong. There are more events after this that he doesn't know how awful he was.

&#x200B;

Months later she dies. The night before we took her to the hospital I was reading to my kids for bedtime and I don't bring my phone in with me when I read to them. He was parked in front of his computer. She texted both of us saying she thought she needed to go to the hospital. He told me he did not hear/notice the message. I was in with my kids so didn't see it for another half an hour. I don't know at this point if I believe he did not see it.

&#x200B;

She died in the hospital 3 days after that message. On a Tuesday. We had been scheduled to have our nephew (his brother's son) for the weekend, Easter weekend. It was to give nephew's parents a chance to get ready to move to a new house. He's a great kid and before mom died I had no problem having him for the weekend. His parents have tough schedules and it is actually very hard for them to get a weekend off together.

&#x200B;

So he came Friday night and the overnights were a clusterfuck. My kids had just lost their grandma and my nephew is going nuts with all my kids toys and it is awful. They did not sleep until midnight. On Easter Sunday, my sister and I had decided to do Easter because my mom had made baskets for all the kids and had filled eggs for an egg hunt and was really looking forward to it. So we had my sister's family over and did the egg hunt and the kids loved it, but it was very hard, since we had it in her space. My husband was supposed to take nephew home around noon, but did not. I kept asking him to take him home, but he told me he wanted to give his brother as much time as possible, and did not take him home until after dinner. Every hour was excruciating when I just wanted to cry in private and could not get a moment's peace.

&#x200B;

Later that week, my husband's step-mother asked me why we had had my nephew over when the whole family (3 households) had offered to take him after my mom died. My husband told everyone that no - we said we would take him and so we would take him.  He did not even ask me. I told him I was disappointed that his brother was his priority on the week my mother died. He did not respond at the time, but told me later that he was following my lead (AKA - ALL MY FAULT) because we hadn't cancelled Easter. When I pointed out that it was all my mom's plan and my sister and her daughter had just lost their mom/grandma, so we were celebrating my mom - he said he got that now but did not get it then.

&#x200B;

Two weeks later we had my mom's funeral. We had family (4 adults) coming in who would be staying with us in my mom's space. We had drama with another family member who were rude while my mom was sick which didn't affect anything except stress levels. Emotions were high. I had had to meet with the pastor and help plan the service, help notify all the family, and help my kids work through their grief and answer questions about death. Our neighbors down the street were VERY pregnant, with a scheduled induction the day of the funeral. He offered to take their oldest child for a sleepover, even though their parents were in town, and we have a neighborhood full of friendly houses who would take him if they were at the hospital. I asked him directly why he would invite another kid to the house when I had told him specifically how hurtful that was to me before. He said he did not really think they would ask us to take them (so it was an empty offer). He did not apologize to me, he did not offer to make other arrangements. I had to tell him directly that he needed to change it, and that it would not be OK to have another kid there. He did make other arrangements.

&#x200B;

His mom attended the funeral, and had a serious health event during. She ended up spending the night at our very full house. She slept in our bed, I slept in a recliner, and my husband slept on the couch. I had planned to take the next day off work to take care of myself. He asked me to take care of his mom that day, since I would be home, instead of him taking a day off to care for his own mom. I had been on a leave of absence from work, and had taken a great deal of time off to take care of my mom. It infuriates me that he could not take one goddamned day to care for his own mother and to allow me to care for myself. I took care of his mom.

&#x200B;

Mother's day was three weeks after my mom died. It was a hard day for me. I was crying a lot. He planned nothing except to take kids shopping for presents (after he tried to make plans with other kids that day and I reminded him it was mother's day). The kids wanted to make me breakfast in bed which he helped them with. All morning he kept asking me well what do you want to do? What do you want to do? (for mother's day). I was broken down crying and my kids were asking me what was so upsetting and I talked to them about their grandma. I told him (crying) that I was upset that he had not hugged or kissed me at all that day. He didn't answer. I was crying more and said ""really? Nothing??"" and he patted me on the shoulder. I took the kids out of the house for the rest of the day. Later he apologized but told me I had not been affectionate with him recently (WHILE MY MOM WAS DYING) and so he didn't feel comfortable. (AKA-ALL MY FAULT)

&#x200B;

He has done nothing to help deal with my mom's estate. I am a co-executor and have to deal with financial accounts, but he could make phone calls to cancel credit cards, deal with her health equipment, dispose of her meds - or even just fucking get the mail, which he also does not do. I have told him I am overwhelmed with the work and he offers nothing. I have asked him to do minimal tasks like putting the car tabs on the car, which he could not manage and I had to do.

&#x200B;

A few weeks after she died was her birthday. We had a party for her to celebrate her so that our kids could have something positive about her where none of their grownups are crying. My husband hates my sister and her husband. It was at my house, so I told him he could just be upstairs and not join in. He asked if I would prefer it that way, and I said yes. Note that he has told me directly that he hates them and refuses to go to their home at this point. His reason is stupid, IMO, and it broke my sister when she figured it out. During the party the kids asked if he would play with him and he told them I would be angry with him if he did, so he couldn't play with them. I sent them up with a plate of appetizers, which he rejected. I sent a kid up to ask if he wanted a plate of food for dinner because he had been upstairs all day. He sent me a text telling me not to involve the kids in this - I told him (via text) he was the one who told them I would be angry if he played with them and all I did was offer him food. Anyway lots of texts back and forth and we end up in a screaming match. I had had drinks. I was screaming at him that he hated my mom and wanted her dead and hated my family and was awful. He screamed that he wanted a divorce.

&#x200B;

He emailed later to apologize for ruining the day. I am fucking done with him and told him I would work with a mediator to split assets and make a parenting plan. He told me he would 'let me schedule it' to work with my schedule. So now I'm in charge of the fucking divorce, too. I have an appointment with an attorney in a couple weeks. I'm so fucking angry knowing that I will end up doing 90% of the work to sell/pack our house. If I want out I need to do it, but I'm still dealing with my mom's estate, and STILL GRIEVING. Also way behind at work because I took so much time out. He's a teacher and has only one class all summer. He is staying home with kids. He is so fucking lazy and won't do anything.

&#x200B;

He still brings up what a great thing we did by letting my mom move in. He is really proud of himself. He thinks he is amazing. He doesn't know he did almost fucking nothing. I don't know how to communicate this to him without drunken screaming or a counselor present. I'm not working on the marriage, he is unforgivable, but he needs to know. How do I communicate this while we need to work together to get through the divorce, and need to co-parent for at least 14 more years?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Holy crap, thank you all for your advice. I'm working my way through them.

I wanted to clarify one thing that wasn't in the original post - some people are saying that it wasn't fair to expect him to be an afternoon caregiver every day and to be on call 24/7 - which I understand. After the first hospitalization, we hired home health care workers to come in three days a week (mom paid). If we had not been able to do that, I would have had to quit my job to care for her. So her immediate needs (meds, hygiene, laundry, shopping, doctors appointments) were not either of our immediate responsibility. I sometimes took her to doctors appointments if I could work it into my schedule. I only work 4 days a week so I was home one of the days we did not have care. There was only one afternoon per week where he was the only adult around. My sister also lives less than a mile away and would come over at least once a week to do whatever chore/errand my mom needed. I wasn't expecting him to nursemaid. None of us were ready for how quickly things declined.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Clarification about the emergency bell. My mom had only rung the bell once before this event. That was her first hospitalization. We found her passed out on the floor. There was no reason my husband should have thought it was nothing serious. She had a cell phone, a land line, and a Life Alert necklace as well for when we were not home.

I'll start off by saying my grandmother is currently alive. She is in her 90s with advanced alzheimer's and had a massive stroke. She cannot speak and can hardly move. Her time will come soon. My family has started discussing arrangements so everyone knows what we'll have to do.

She currently lives in CT at the nursing facilty that my mother works at as director of nursing. My mother is her legal guardian or power of attorney or whatever. I live in GA.

When my grandfather passed last April, I went to the funeral in Connecticut alone. My new husband and I work together for the same company. We were not married at the time that my grandfather passed. (Together 2 years, married nearly 2 months) Our work offers bereavement leave for your spouse's family, but not your fiancee's family. He didn't have enough PTO saved to go with me, so I understood him not coming. I was not upset at all, but the funeral was very hard on me, in addition to the fact that I had to deal with my family alone who is also difficult on their own. I would have wanted him there had it been possible.

Tonight on the way to dinner, I casually mentioned we will be going to TN for the funeral, not to CT like I had originally assumed. My grandparents elected to be buried with their own parents and not with each other. I was not aware this had been decided until yesterday when I spoke to my mother.

My husband looked confused and said, ""I won't be going to the funeral."" I was like ""Why not? Now that we are married, you'll get bereavement leave."" He said, ""I don't like the idea of taking bereavement leave unnecessarily. I never met this woman. You hardly talk about her."" I started getting defensive ""What are you talking about? I visit her every time I am in town. I have definitely talked about her."" He said firmly, ""I'm not going."" I dropped it temporarily because I didn't want to spend our dinner fighting. 

I tried to bring it up again tonight when we were going to bed. Like just crawled into bed when its normal for us to chat a few minutes before going to sleep. I told him ""Its important to me that you come to the funeral with me. I will want your support."" He grumbled ""I'm going to sleep"" and refused to talk to me. 

I'm confused where to go from here. He hasn't mentioned what I consider to be a justifiable reason for not going. If it were like ""being near dead people makes me really uncomfortable"" or something like that I would try to understand, but I don't think its fair for him to ...invalidate my future grieving? as a reason not to go.

My ex and I broke up two months ago and since then I have worked on a few project with my work friend and have started to look at him a bit differently.

He?s handsome, charming, funny, and very passionate about the same thing I am passionate about. So I have developed a small crush. Sometimes I think about it and I think we would make a terrific power couple. Sometimes I think it would just be fun to be fwb. So my emotions are mixed but no matter how much I tell myself this is a bad idea, I just keep thinking about him.

One last thing, on our last work trip he confided in two of my close girl friends that he was worried that I had a crush on him and that he didn?t want it to mess up our friendship. One girl friend told me that it was because he was uncomfortable and worried that he would lose me as a friend. The other thinks that he just secretly also has a crush on me and doesn?t know what to do.

So I don?t know what to do. I won?t see him again until mid July but when I do we are hitting the ground running on our next two projects so I will see him a lot.

144,idiotg,[new],6,c7aafm,5,"Hey everyone. I'll try to keep it short and simple.

I was in my first and only relationship from the age of 20-26. He broke up with me one year ago and it honestly didn't hurt that bad because I think I was mentally checked out of that relationship for quite a while. I regret staying with him for as long as I did.

I started dating someone new about a month after the breakup. He was someone I knew for a few years from work and I was interested in him while I was in my relationship but never acted on it. I don't want to bore you with details but he ended it after six months and it broke my heart. In the five months since, I've really struggled with the thought of being alone/happy on my own.

I recently started talking to someone I met online and I completely fell for him in a really short amount of time. We talked every day for three weeks and hung out a lot. He's by far the funniest person I've ever met, he's smart and kind and caring and I find him incredibly sexy. Hanging out with him made me the happiest I've been in a long time, probably since I first started dating my second bf. It's so hard to explain how he made me feel but hopefully you know what I'm talking about if you've been there before. So the problem is that I'm only in town for the summer before I have to go back to school for one more year in a city about 5 hours away. After a conversation about his ex that I didn't react too well to, we had a talk about where we were going and he said he wouldn't be interested in pursuing something long distance after the summer ended. Cue me having an anxiety attack about having to choose between hanging out for two more months and then breaking up or breaking up now. I kept going back and forth about which would suck less but I ended up saying something that hurt him and he decided to end things to prevent it from hurting worse at the end of the summer.This has pretty much mentally wrecked me. I felt depressed and had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life and really had to fight the urge to contact him. I feel like a crazy person because after four weeks, I still can't get him out of my head. I'm still having trouble sleeping, I can't listen to the songs he used to sing. I can't give up on the hope that one day I'll reach out to him and we'll be able to try again. Logically, I know I need to let go and at some point, I'll meet someone else. I just don't know how to get through the next however many months it'll take before the first and last thing I think about during my day isn't a guy. I'm a smart woman but I feel so ashamed at how my life is completely taken over by a relationship or lack thereof. I know I need to stay single and focus on myself but I get lonely and long for the butterflies and happiness that I can only seem to get from talking to a guy.

145,toomuchonmymindtoday,Dating,4,c7a4mh,2,"My girlfriend (26/F) and I have been together for a year and a half. Things were amazing for the first six months, then things were good for the next six months, but the last six we have been fighting a lot. We are getting close to the end of what?s called the honeymoon phase of a relationship, so maybe this is normal and things will reach an equilibrium with time. At the moment, though, we don?t seem to see eye to eye and I am concerned.

For background, I recently had my sister cut contact. She has a history of cutting contact with people when things aren?t perfect with a friendship. A year ago she called me herself best friend. That was the first time she had ever called me that. Now she says she never wants to hear from me again. Because I asked her to give back the money she owes me. She owes me over $1,000. Because I asked her for advice on a few things and then she said I was treating her like she was my therapist. I thought friends, especially best friends, ask each other for advice, regardless of familial ties. And because I wasn?t aware that she ended up in the hospital. She never told me she was in the hospital. I don?t live near her and she wasn?t responding to my texts at the time. I currently have zero ways of contacting her and don't know where she lives anymore. I just know that she moved somewhere.

My mother was abusive and controlling growing up. When I was in my late teens, we moved and she forbade me and my sister from staying friends with anyone we knew before the move. Our mother believed that our old town was filled with Satanic witches who were trying to put curses on our fundamentalist Christian family. She believed that they were going to summon demonic beings that were going to kill us. Her paranoid delusions dictated our lives. She then made it near impossible for me to make friends once we moved. She forbade talking about our lives to non-family. After I was legally an adult, I was in the hospital and my mother kicked me out of the house. She said my health issues made it too hard on the family and she couldn?t do it anymore. I had just started dating this girl. My mother hated everything about her because she wasn't any sort of Christian. I suspect this is the real reason I got kicked out. This girl was the first real connection I had made with anyone in years.

Once I got kicked out, I ended up moving in with her. Things were fine at first, not great. Eventually, though, she started being abusive, both physically and emotionally. I felt trapped. I had no one. I stayed with her in an abusive relationship for years, because I was afraid of leaving. Eventually, I did leave. I couldn?t be with her any longer. Her abuse became daily and nightly. She nuked every relationship I had made with other people during our time together. I didn't make many. She scared them away, some by threatening to hurt them. Once I left, I reconnected with my sister because my sister had recently distanced herself from our mother because of the abuse growing up. My sister and I became very close, or so I thought.

I didn?t date anyone for a long time because of my ex. I didn?t feel like I could. Eventually, I felt some healing and that changed. After some very unsuccessful dates with other people, I met my current girlfriend and we hit it off from the start. I fell head over heels for her. She appeared to have done the same for me. It was romantic. It was passionate. It was what I always wanted. But the romance and the passion are fading and bitterness and fighting are taking their place.

I am worried that my thoughts of ending things with my girlfriend are a form of self-sabotaging, partially in response to my sister. I almost broke up with her the other night, but I stopped myself. Unlike my ex, I don?t think she is abusive in any way. We just don?t always see eye to eye. I see us as being less compatible than I originally thought, than we both originally thought. I don?t want to stay in a relationship because of fear, like in the past, even if the fear is of being alone. I want to end a relationship if it isn?t right. I don?t know what right is. I don?t know what wrong is, too, when it isn?t blatant abuse.

My original post didn't get a ton of attention but I'm really grateful for the posters who shared their perspectives so I'm writing an update.

So after he said that he would have chosen the other girl over me I was super sad and wanted some time apart, but he said he was really worried and anxious and wanted to see me.  I told him that I don't really want to see him but if he really wanted to then I would meet him.

So he came to meet me after work the next day and he brought flowers and a small gift and apologised.  He said he was sorry that he had kept the information from me and that he knew it was a mistake but he just thought that if he told me at the beginning about the other girl, I wouldn't want to be with him, and that he didn't want to do that because he didn't want to lose me.  

He said that I misunderstood about him choosing the other girl over me because he 'didn't say those words'.  He said that at the time, because he wasn't sure if I liked him or not then he would've gone out with the other girl because he was sure that she liked him so it made more sense.  So I just told him that I understand that but it hurt to hear it.  I said I think I just wanted to know if he was happy with me now, and whether he was happy that things worked out how they did with me, because I was feeling insecure.  He said that he really liked me and that's why he was fighting so hard for this to make things work between us.   He also said that for him, it was really easy for him to separate the person I appeared to be before we were dating (I was really guarded with my feelings, not very open in showing affection, etc), and who I appear to be now (I'm much more open and affectionate now because I trust him with my feelings), so for him to say he would've gone out with the other girl over me, it's more like the 'me' that I showed to him back then, rather than 'me' as he knows me now (if that makes sense).

I got out of a relationship about a month ago and recently started talking to this new guy, who is great!! I really love talking to him and I can definitely see something with him in the future (but I?d obviously give it some more time since my last relationship just ended). Also, I am 5?6 and weight maybe 170-180, so definitely a bit on the bigger side but I also have a large ass and decently sized boobs so I think I look pretty proportional.

My last boyfriend was a lot bigger than me, this new guy is a little taller but def skinner than me, and it made me self conscious at first but I don?t really care anymore as long as he doesn?t care. 

All of a sudden, he?d say kind of odd comments to me. Like I?d tell him I was eating and he?d be like ?ooh eat up girl!! Don?t hold back? or like I asked him what his type was and he said thicker girls and he?s like ?you could even gain more weight and I?d think you?re absolutely gorgeous, just like you are right now? and like he tries to get me to eat food, tells me I don?t need to go to the gym, stuff like that. 

I get that it can just be a preference and the word ?fetish? is probably too extreme but I?m hesitant about being in a relationship with a guy that?s gonna try and fatten me up lmao.

150,pluralisticadvntrs,[new],1,c79w0f,2,"tl;dr I've been dealing with personal issues and haven't dated someone in 5 years and hooked up with someone in 3. A close friend who I was into when we just met told me she liked me today. She's very emotionally reserved and that's a factor that has ruined previous relationships, which made me not want to ask her in the past. I'm worried if things don't pan out, I'll lose a close friend. Feeling real confused...

&#x200B;

I'll do my best to keep this short. First, a bit on me. I've been in 3 relationships and only had a few ppl I've hooked up with outside of that. I had serious depression/suicidal ideation about 5 years back and decided to focus on me and improving my well-being after that. I'm much better overall and am switching careers after just finishing grad school. However, I now realize that between not being in a relationship in so long and not having hooked up with anyone in the last three years and my depression and my pot addiction, I've become too comfortable with myself and am having some weird reticence towards trying to date. I also still remember how enamored I would generally get with my partners and when I don't feel that, I assume I'm not really into someone. 

&#x200B;

So I met my friend (A) in grad school (2 year program). During year 1, we knew each other but didn't really talk much. She's a cool, smart, attractive person so I was very much into her when we just met. There was a public shooting in the city where we were studying towards the beginning of year 2 and she was having a tough time after that. I generally try to react to people in my environment who are clearly dealing with mental health issues because of what I've dealt with throughout my life. We hung out a bunch that week (mostly us two and one other person who immediately reacted to help her out). We became good friends after that, have hung out a bunch, and have texted 1-a few times a day. I know I've been one of the people she's been most open with. And being friends with A has been a big factor in helping me get out my depressive shell in my last semester of grad school, but I never had the impulse to ask her out which seems like a big deal to me for the below reason. 

&#x200B;

As we got to know each other more, I realized that she's someone who for culturally, family, and general life reasons is not someone who is as emotionally open as I am. I'm used to working through things by talking about them. I'm very comfortable speaking about, listening to, and having a conversation about serious topics. I get very frustrated when someone has strong feelings that are affecting our relationship but they can't/don't want to talk about it. My last relationship ended very poorly because both my previous partner and I didn't know how to manage her being reserved and stubborn (amongst other issues). I think that played a role in me getting much less into the idea of asking A out/being in a relationship with her. Her bringing up the conversation shows a lot in terms of her trying to improve there though. And I don't know if I'm 'not feeling it' because I'm subconsciously scared of being in a relationship again or because I genuinely think this is something that's a dealbreaker for me. She's also debating whether to stay in this city for a job she's kind of excited about but isn't what she thought she'd be doing after this degree/still wants to move home (which is in a bigger city). I'm worried this could somehow affect her decision-making process, and I'd feel horrible if she stayed here, things didn't pan out, and she felt stuck (which also happened in the last relationship). And the thought of losing her as a friend sounds scarier than dating her sounds exciting.

Before I start explaining everything, I hope anyone who reads this will be less judgmental and try to see things from another angle. I will try to go through all the necessary details because I want to get the best most effective solution for my current issue.

So I met him in 2014 online and we had on and off relationship early on. On late 2015, I texted him again and we have been in touch since then. Our relationship was never casual or friendship based, it was mostly platonic and sexual. We didn't plan to meet because both of us were trying to get our feet on the ground. Initially, I really just talked to him for sexting and I thought he also used me for the same purpose. But later on, every time we interact it seems like we were crazy for each other and want to meet so badly.

On early 2017, he met a girl there and started dating. They have been together and live together until now. I told him right away if we should stop to avoid hurting her or ruining his relationship. But he said he didn't want to stop contacting with me. By the end of the day, I let him dated the girl while casually talking maybe just once a month.

On last October, I told him I couldn't keep interacting with him and I need closure because I started having real feelings for him. He said okay, but within a month we started talking again. Few months after that, I told him everything about my feelings and how it hurt me. He said he couldn't do much and wanted the best for me. I remembered we didn't talk for a few weeks.

Things got really ugly these past two months when our interaction grew even closer. I honestly think he genuinely likes me like what he said to me. But his lack of action proves that he doesn't want to do anything with me and that he doesn't feel the same way as I do.

At first, it was easy to break the cycle, but when we constantly text each other like this I'm feeling a lot more confused. Two weeks ago, I told him I will come to meet so we can solve things or get closure for each other. I told him I will make the sacrifice for both of us to finally meet. But, he seemed really reluctant to meet or make it happen. He even told me that he only wants to meet to enjoy the time together not to end things or get closure. I'm really confused about how things are going right now.

I know some might say we were cheating, but to be honest we have been like this long before he dated the girl. This has been the toughest thing in my life, every time I'm getting close to other people I always come back to him. I never feel this intensely toward someone, I never want to sacrifice this much for someone, but with him, I feel weak and powerless. I'm not even sure if it's love, infatuation, or insanity. I really think I'm crazy and delusional at this point and I can't stop thinking about him,

All I want is to end this forever if that's the best thing to happen. I'm not even sure if I want to be with him, to be honest. I do desire him but I want to be logical. I do feel like I'm the who is crazy for him but when I told him he responded with the most welcoming gesture. It made me think I'm not the only one who feels like this? I'm currently restricting our interaction, even when it usually means he doesn't reply to my text until like four days later. I want to focus on things in my life and not him anymore. I want to wake up loving my life and myself instead of thinking about him.

Please, tell me how to move on over this?

When we moved away, we were living out of a hotel because of his job (he was onsite for 3 months and the alternative was to not see each other). I was depressed, and gained a lot of weight. I then got pregnant and gained more. It was a rough pregnancy and rough delivery.

Over the past year or so, he's been extremely and increasingly rude to me. When I ask him about it, he says it's because of my weight and fitness levels. Because I'm overweight, I limit him in the activities he'd like to do, and I also make more food than he needs or wants to eat. He says because I'm fat and not doing anything about it, I'm lazy. He doesn't respect me as a result -- and I think he's saying he doesn't respect me overall due to this.

I'm about 205lbs, 5'4"", for reference. I know I'm overweight. 

The few times I have tried to get into an exercise routine and change my diet, either what I'm doing isn't ""enough"" or he doesn't want to eat what I'm making. For example: I started going for walks (25-40 mins, depending on weather), and he said that wasn't going to do anything. I told him I was just trying to get out and *do* something, but he said it wasn't going to help with the weight loss, so it didn't count. I tried going to a gym and doing some weights, but unless I was going 4x per week, again he said it was useless. If I went and didn't tell him about it, he'd complain that I wasn't exercising, and not believe me when I told him I had been going all along. If I go and tell him, he says I'm ""bragging"" about going when my exercise isn't really that much. 

Before I went to therapy for the PPD, husband did try to get me to go. He also said if I exercised, that would ""cure"" me. When I didn't do either for the first few months (I was in denial about how bad it was) he told me that he'd tried to get me to go, but if I wasn't going to help myself, he wasn't either. When I said that I thought things weren't working out between us and maybe we should separate, he said he was going to tell the court I was suicidal/depressed so he would keep our daughter. So I stayed, and eventually got help. He complained about how often I was going and how expensive it was, and didn't want to talk about the therapy at all. He never asked me how things were going or how I was feeling.

He travels a lot for work, and often I have to take care of our daughter for weeks at a time, alone. He expects me to fit a workout routine into the schedule, but doesn't want me to hire a babysitter so I can go in the evenings or on weekends. I work full time but do WFH, so there is a little flexibility. But it is hard to adhere to a rigid schedule every single day when I have no breaks. We know a few neighbors here and he knows his co-workers, but I don't have any friends or family nearby who could watch the baby for me. EDIT: the neighbors have watched the baby, but since they are older and she is frequently sick, I don't feel like I can rely on them all the time.

We went on vacation a few weeks ago, and he wanted to walk EVERYWHERE. Didn't want to take buses or use subways or anything, so over 2 weeks we walked 130 miles. I complained, because my feet hurt and it wasn't what I wanted out of Vacation. He says it proves that I'm so terribly unfit and that I ruined parts of his vacation.

The latest fight tonight was him telling me he doesn't have any respect for me and is just going to try to annoy me more unless I work out. He said fat people dont deserve respect, and he doesnt care if he hurts my feelings anymore. He's also sleeping in the guest room because he's mad that earlier in the night I told him to stop bothering me. He had come up behind me and started grabbing my shoulders, chest/boobs, and ears and it was really annoying. He even characterizes it as he came over to bug me, but somehow thinks me being bothered is an overreaction. 

I know that I should be exercising. I want to lose weight and be more fit. But I feel like that's hard to just *start* and each time I try to add more fitness to my routine he tells me how it's not good enough.

Lately I've been thinking I should divorce him. I don't want to hurt our daughter in the process, but I hate the way he treats me and it sounds like he's not going to change unless I'm thin. 

Looking for honest feedback, even if I won't like it.


Tldr; husband is frustrated that I'm overweight and not exercising, treats me poorly because of it. I'm struggling because I don't think he's being fair/supportive, and thinking we aren't compatible. Looking for advice.

EDIT2: I'll add too that I've tried asking him to go to marriage counseling, and I've asked him directly if he wants a divorce. He won't do counseling and says it's not that he wants a divorce, he just doesn't want me to be fat (and he was clear about that when we first started dating). If I did divorce him, I'd be moving back home (5 hours away) and he's said he won't be visiting to see our daughter.

EDIT3 since it came up in a comment: I don't blame him for wanting me to be thinner/healthy or being frustrated that I'm overweight compared to when we met. I think that's great! But he's mean about it, and when I do start to make progress he's mean about that, too. If all he was doing was casually talking about it, or asking me what I'm doing, or encouraging me... we wouldn't be here. Him doing nothing would also be fine. But he's **Negative** constantly. If I do something, it's not good enough. If I don't do anything, I'm a terrible person. If I tell him what I did, I'm 'bragging about doing something minimal'. If I don't tell him anything, he doesn't believe me when I say I have done stuff.",1561874256.0,Is my marriage over?,1.0

We have a very good relationship all my friends & family absolutely love her and her parents and friends love me aswell. Everything was perfect and sailing smoothly until last night after I picked her up from being out with friends. 

She popped the question about us and was just unsure about the whole situation between us and we both cried and talked about it all. She is giving us a week to see if she still wants to remain in a relationship with me.

Now I understand that it?s only a two month relationship and before her I was in a very emotionally abusive relationship for two years and I took my own time to heal and back off from the dating scene (1 YR Break From Everything).

This girl has brightened my life in so many different ways as I have moved 2hrs away from my home city to study at the University I wanted to attend. Moving was very scary as I knew no one and only her. We were ?seeing? each other for a good three months before we started being official.

Last night has confused and hurt me as I feel lost and as if I have done something wrong I?m not sure what to do as I want to remain in a relationship with her. What could I do in this week to try and help her with whatever she is facing and or give her the space she needs this week so she can really see if she wants to stay together.

156,youllneverfindout1,[new],4,c79pfd,2,"Here?s a little background on my sexual history. I lost my virginity when I was 18 and a freshman in college. Since then, I?ve had 4 sexual partners. The first guy was someone I had a lot of feelings for, so while the sex was shitty (we both were virgins) it still one of the better sexual experiences I had. The second guy was a hookup because it?s been awhile and I was sexual frustrated. The sex was really good but I was not into it whatsoever. Did not enjoy myself at all. The 3rd guy (who ended up being my first boyfriend) I obviously was in love with and had the longest period of sex with. It was over the course of 9 months. He was someone I explored a lot with, got comfortable with, and no matter how vanilla the sex could be that night, I always got off. Sex was just so so good with him because I had so many feelings. Things ended because he moved away. 

So It?s been 5months since I had sex and I recently had a ?hookup? (it?s in parentheses bc it wasn?t supposed to be one but that?s irrelevant) with a guy who I was getting to know and maybe see potential with? But i feel like i was just using him to forget about my ex more (although i felt pretty over him, i think i just didn?t want my last guy to be my ex, stupid i know) But regardless of that, the sex was just okay. I didn?t get off, it wasn?t the worst, and I had this weird out of body experience. It?s like I wasn?t there during sex or rather I was watching myself have sex. Then the next day I think about it and I?m like ?did I really have sex? I don?t know it?s just weird.

So I?ve never been a fan of hookups mainly because im super insecure. And it really just doesn?t do much for me? It?s a lot of work to have sex and get no pleasure from it. I only truly love it when I have feelings for someone. 

I have no feelings for anyone, granted I have no one interested in me no matter how hard I try to find someone. And it sucks because I?m incredibly sexually frustrated because I miss that passion, that attention, that love, the desire for each other. The things you don?t get in a hookup. Even masturbating isn?t cutting it. I?ll get off but it?s like whatever. I?m young and in my prime time of always wanting sex but here I am, not getting it because I need feelings and that?s just not happening right now. So I really just don?t know how to get this sexual frustration out without hookups or maybe i just need to bypass this restriction I put on myself. I genuinely tried with this last dude but he?s been super busy and kinda flakey. So that?s obviously going no where. 

TL;DR I?m sexually frustrated and I can?t have hookups because it does nothing for me. Sex is only pleasurable when I have feelings and I don?t know how to fix this frustration",1561873582.0,I (22F) am sexually frustrated but I can?t do hookups,0.75

160,throwaway6291911,[new],13,c79dob,4,"A little background- my daughter, let's call her Emma, has lived with us more or less her whole life.  She has worked on and off but is completely dependent on myself and her mother (my wife) for support.  For the past 4 years, she's been at our local community college and will be transferring to a university and moving to a large city this coming fall.  

We, again, offered to help with tuition and even housing for the remainder of her time in school, but she was adamant on taking out some student loans and using grants and scholarships to get her way through school.  I thought, no problem.  I'm a pretty easy-going guy and, although we'll still be here for her to fall back on, I trust her to make her own decisions on what she wants to do and plan accordingly.  

So, she started looking at rooms for rent (dorms were full), and recently told me she found a relatively affordable room in a condo close to the city currently housing a single male, his sister, and her husband (all in their thirties).  She looked at other places, but did mention along the way that this would probably be her top choice--that the house seemed quiet and safe, the people currently living there were refreshingly normal and nice, yadda yadda yadda.  I never thought twice about it.  She got the place, and asked me for a loan to cover the deposit and first month's rent (she will receive her financial aid a little after she moves in, works on a very part-time basis, and has no way to cover it without me).  I said no problem.  I can afford it and I'm always willing to help her out.   

Well, I let some time pass and I broached the conversation with her mother, my wife (who she conveniently hadn't yet told about the situation).  She was completely against it.  And now I'm having second thoughts, thinking my daughter might be making a decision that is completely, categorically unsafe.  My rationale is as follows:

\-she found this place on craigslist

\-the couple will be moving out at the end of this year, and until they find another tenant, my daughter would be living with just this random guy

\-not only that, but she has to share a bathroom with him in the meantime

\-she knows next to nothing about these people beyond their first names/hobbies/what they do for a living

When I told her about these concerns, she got defensive and a little upset.  She assumed that my wife changed my mind for me, and says she doesn't trust her mother to be reasonable about these things.  We've had these types of conversations before (mostly with my wife getting anxious when Emma leaves without telling her where she's going, forgets to text her, etc, and Emma feeling like she can't, in her words, go anywhere, see anyone, or do anything she enjoys).  I tend to feel caught in the middle and can honestly see both sides.  Yes, my wife tends to be very high-strung and hyper-cautious, and she does get very anxious about Emma being around people she doesn't personally know (more than I personally agree with).  On the other hand, my daughter is 22, and while she currently tends to make good, safe decisions, she is fairly sheltered and it seriously concerns me that she didn't want to run a background check or anything on these guys before deciding to go forward with the room. 

Emma did also tell me that she could see my concerns and second-guessed checking out the place for the exact reason, but that she had no hesitations after seeing the place.  She told me she spent several hours at the condo seeing the place and talking with the current tenants (mostly the male in question), loved the living situation, and felt safe with them.  

She told me she broached the subject with said male about future tenants making her feel unsafe and liked his answers--that he would throw them out upon the first accusation and look for only female tenants if they decided to rent to her.  She explained it was a month-to-month situation, that she would look for another place or come home at the first sign of trouble, and she was willing to get all of her roommates' information or even bring me by the place if I needed more information before deciding whether or not I wanted to loan her the money.  She shared that while she does not feel entitled to any financial help from me, she's frustrated and feels financially trapped.  She then said that she had made her decision and would be looking into private loans or borrowing from friends if I couldn't do it.  I'd prefer that she not, which is why I was initially willing to loan her the money.  

To reiterate, I am completely financially okay with giving her the advance.  This is something I would do for her in any other situation.  My hesitation in giving her the loan is completely based on whether or not it would be best to try to make her reconsider.  At the same time, I don't want to be overbearing or off-base in my decision.  I basically want to determine whether my concerns are valid and am really going back and forth on this.  Any thoughts on this situation are appreciated.  Thanks!

However, she's also the only one in his friend group that's a single girl. When my bf and I first started dating, he was super excited for me to meet her and was particularly excited for me to meet this particular friend, because  he thought that we were very similar in personality and would get along. I haven't actually sat down and talked to her, but we have exchanged ""hello""s but that's about it. I've had bad past relationships and so trusting someone's love doesn't come naturally to me anymore. When he told me that we are very similar, the thoughts of ""technically, he could just date her"" or ""why would he date me when they seem to be getting along very well"" run through my head.  To look solely of physical appearances, I am thinner, curvy and perhaps, I look better next to him.

I, however, do not and have something that conflicts with the beginning of the event. I was planning to come around the middle of it. Now, I get really irritated when he tells me that we will just meet there and I  can ""come and go "" as I like because since we aren't driving there together, the other girl will be driving him there and back.

The chemistry was intense, the sex great and the conversations even more so. Right as things were ending he was pushing me away. He was emotionally distant and I was withdrawing and pulling in more on myself the more he refused to engage with me. We both needed the break, but I didn?t want it, and I still don?t know that he did either. 

2 days after we broke up, I slept with an old fwb; Red. The sexual frustration since my split with Bear has been real. The amount of masturbating I?ve done is ridiculous. 2 weeks after our split, we?re texting again. A literal month after our split, we went on a hike, ended up hanging out all day, and had unprotected sex. Y?know, like a couple of idiots. 

Anyways, we had a serious talk about it about 2 weeks later I think. And neither of us is in the emotional place for a serious relationships, so we establish that we?re friends that have feelings for each other (and they?re definitely much stronger on my part) and occasionally sleep together. Basically dating very very casually I guess? But ever since we had this conversation our dynamic is so different. 

I wouldn?t go as far as to say that he?s more passionate or invigorated, but the sexual chemistry seems to have become even more intense and charged. Whenever we?re together, it just starts building and building, and it seems so much powerful since we?ve split up and started talking again. 

But it?s more than that. I feel like he?s a different person somehow. The way he interacts with me is more natural I think. He seems to be showing more of himself and expressing more of his quirks. He is unabashed and unembarrassed and I realized I don?t really understand him at all. (But then again I?ve only known him for about 6 months)  He talks to me differently, and he?s being so strange. He?s more vocal in his appreciation of my looks and body, and he?s meticulous in his seduction attempts. He also seems more possessive. We?d been walking downtown and he got irritated that I was being stared at. He was trying to hide that he was annoyed, but he admitted to feeling agitated that there was some gawking. It?s happened before but he?s never been bothered enough to  comment on it. 

The entire way he texts me is different. Like he uses more emojis and emoticons, when he?d usually break out literally one emoji and use it very sparingly. He used to shy away from eye contact if I was looking at him for a long time, but the dynamic has changed so that I?m usually the one to back down. 

I just can?t figure out why things have changed so much. I feel like my behavior towards him has remained the same for the most part, save that I?m far more reserved in my emotional stuff. I?m not expressing things the way I used to, and I?m curious why that?s happening. I want to know why he?s so different with me and if this should just be a natural

Idk it might be a silly thing to be this upset about but I honestly thought he was the most respectful, honest, and loyal person I had ever met. When I was proven wrong it absolutely crushed me. I want to get over it because I can?t stand knowing I am the reason that he is sad. Everything he does is for me and he feels like it goes unnoticed and unappreciated, but its the complete opposite. I am still with him because I see the progress he has made and appreciate every little thing. Its not him making me upset, its myself, but what hurts him is that he cant fix it. Thats why I need to get over it completely, but its like theres a hole in my heart that can?t be filled. I am writing to you all because I am curious how it looks to other, unbiased people and looking for tips on how to handle the situation

166,humble_af,[new],19,c79240,0,"Here are just two examples of her maniupulative sick ways..

**She just posted reddit:** ""My BF doesn't sleep with me, what a nice girl like me is supposed to do bluh bluh."" (I leave the link to her post in comments)

**Key material facts that she didn't mention in her post:**

1. She hit me in the face, cuss me out in public, break my stuff, and wastes all the time that I have to spend on my career on trying to find her through the town and solve her BPD problems.
2. 99% of my calls never ever get answered. 90% of times she's imposing her BPD silent treatment and block my number and doesn't talk to me.

Who, on this earth, would be able to make geniune love with someone, who just wasted 24 hours of time, and lots of loss of money, and energy, and blocked their calls for 20 hours for no reason? Doesn't it affect one's mind in maniupulative ways to describe the problem as he is describing vs. the truth? It's not like I don't wanna have sex with her, it's that I don't even find her!!!!! And when I do, it is so late, that I have lost so many things, that I have to jump into stopping my losses, replacing broking stuff, and recovering from the damages, rather than jump into having sex. In fact, I have so much stress because of her that I cannot even have sex. (Read about the effects on silent treatment passive abuse on one's mental wellbeing and you see what I'm going through..)

**Another example of maniupulative posts she posted on reddit: ""My Bf doesn't post my picture on Instagram bluh bluh bluh""**

**Key Material facts she doesn't mention:**

1. That I posted her pic 2 years ago when we met. But after she removed and block me from IG multiple times and finally she removed and blocked me forever I removed her photo. She never added me back on IG and never promised to never remove and block me from IG again, thus I found it useless to have picture of someone on my IG when they block me. She's been told that once she shows she doesn't do that behavior again, her picure will be o my IG.
2. That I do not use IG at all. There are no recent pics of me, or any pics of my family. I just don't use social media. That simple.
3. She was on ig for two years posting all sort of pics and get likes from random guys while I wasn't even on IG.
4. Regardless, I told her that I cannot post her picture for so long as my calls don't get answered and she treats me like shit, hitting me, cussing me, and threatening me to go sleep with other guys n stuff like that.

This girl is 16 and my boyfriend is 20. And she honestly thinks she?s in love with him. It?s kind of sickening to me.

I?ve been dating my girlfriend for only about a year and a half now, but things have been starting to take a turn. For reference, I am a year older, just spent my first year in college while she finished up high school. The story on how it all came to be had a long plot which I will be going over first. Basically, in October she had started falling for another guy and she had basically hid me from him. She would go to his house, watch movies with him, even lay in his bed. There was no sexual relationship, but I just let this all happen as I was scared she would breakup with me. (This went on for a month and a half). She had even told me she was losing feelings at one point which shattered me. Once I finally spoke up she came to her senses, and we regained our relationship for the most part (except that this was very hard to forget).

Flash forward to the start of June, I attended a concert with my friends and there were a group of 2 girls we met there. One of the girls conversation with my friends and myself, and  that continued all night. Around this time was when she offered me to put my arms around her and danced on me throughout the entire concert. I did nothing to stop it, as I saw it all as revenge in a way from the pain she caused me. After the concert, we walked around the city together with my friends, and obviously exchanged snapchats.

Ever since that night, i?ve been snapchatting this girl fairly consistently without end (everyday for a month now) and we?re always having a conversation about something. Ever since that night, i?ve started to catch feelings for her and it?s really messed up my head. She lives an hour away from me, and it?s hard for me to tell if she feels just as I do, which causes me stress.

Essentially, my girlfriends body / face is not as attractive as this girl?s and i?ve lost almost all attraction to her in general; which happened as soon as the nights events had occurred. I don?t want to drop her, chase this other girl and end up with nothing; because i?m scared of being lonely. I just don?t know what to do. 


TLDR: Met another girl at a concert much more attractive than my girlfriend in many aspects, and don?t feel attracted to her anymore. also don?t wanna chase this other girl and end up being lonely because i?m scared of having no one.

I matched with a coworker on tinder who I have a crush on, and I don't think the feelings are mutual. I think/hope we can still be friends and this won't affect our workplace. But now I'm just freaking out about my lack of social skills and poor dating experiences.

I'm working full time this summer and then part-time in the fall before I graduate from university at the end of the year. I've had a crush on a coworker - who has a permanent full-time position and is sort of my superior - since I started working there. We get along pretty well - we've hung out outside of work, most of the time around other coworkers, and we even went on a camping trip.

I think I am terrible at picking up of social cues and at dating in general. I grew up with a pretty severe stutter which has contributed to my social anxiety and I think has caused me to miss out on some social development during my teenage and early adult years. I've only been in one relationship when I was 19-20, which left me in a bad place. After that I took a hands-off approach to my romantic life - I thought I'd find someone naturally. However, as an introvert, I found out that a hands off approach actually resulted in nothing because I didn't put myself out there at all... especially after years of avoiding socially uncomfortable situations because of my stutter and other reasons. I've tried online dating and tinder but I've honestly never met up with someone irl.

Anyways, I've been conflicted on whether my coworker likes me back. And maybe I'm just overthinking these social cues. Maybe I made the mistake of bringing my roommate along the first time we hung out outside of work. A few times she's made it seem like she wanted to hang out alone after work (which we had once before but when I was helping her with something) this time was for no apparent reason. She has talked about other guys she's interested in with before - which I thought was a sure sign she wasn't interested. And then on a camping trip I felt we really connected and we even sort of cuddled a bit.  

I ended up seeing her on tinder, swiped right, and we matched a few days later. I first sent some meme indicating the awkwardness of the situation and she responded by saying she just liked me to say hi. We then briefly talked about our experiences with tinder. I think she still just wants to be friends but I haven't asked so directly. I hope/think we could still be friends and I don't think this will affect out workplace (it's a temporary job for me anyways). But I am pretty bummed that I let myself get so hung up on this.

&#x200B;

I'm hopeful for things to work out when I come back, but my big issue is that he never gives/asks for sexual attention when we're apart. No sexting or flirting really, he kinda defaults to making jokes. This isn't without a lack of trying on my part. Instead of playing along with the conversation he just glosses over it. But when we're in person the sexual chemistry is there and he's great at giving me attention? It makes the distance and a romantic connection much harder to maintain.

&#x200B;

At first, I thought maybe he just didn't know how to go about it without being awkward. But recently I found out right before we started dating he was trying to meet people on Tinder / Reddit where he had no problem being sexual. Now I'm just confused.

I don't know why he's not like every other guy asking for nudes, and I don't think we can keep a connection going when I'm gone without this kind of attention. Honestly, it just makes me feel like either I'm not good enough or I'm doing something wrong.

174,nahnoi,[new],4,c78n5m,2,"Sorry I know it?s not advice for me, but i really need advice !!

My brother was really bullied as a kid which lead to pretty bad depression and overall isolation, he has adhd, extreme anger issues, very overweight, and basically isn?t doing anything with his life. He registered for college out of high school at a community college, but dropped out after half of his first semester. My dad refused to pay for his college after that, and so my mom (who before was just a homemaker) picked up a retail job just to pay for my brother to go back to college. Like she?s tired all the time working extreme hours and doesn?t get to keep any of the money for herself really. However, every semester he takes only 2 or 3 courses and they?re all... so random? he?ll take creative writing + some intro business class and then a graphic design class... no clear route to any major. And it?s been like this for the past couple of years with still no degree. 

But anyways, last week he told my mom he doesn?t want to go to college anymore because he wants to focus on writing his ?book? and getting it published (he?s like 4 pages in right now). He asks me to proofread some of his writing, and like... i really don?t see any potential in his work, its not very good. And I most definitely don?t see him making a living off of this. 

He actually has a job at our family friend?s software company (gets paid min wage tho) which is a great opportunity for him to pick up on some cool computer knowledge. But instead of trying to learn something, he sleeps at work, stays in the bathroom for over an hour, comes in late, etc. mainly because he knows that they won?t fire him bc they?re friends with my dad. Like stuff like that really upsets me and makes it understandable as to why my mom wants my brother out of the house. He?s way too comfortable: he has shelter and food for free, my parents bought him a really nice car (they thought it?d motivate him to do well in life lol), he wakes up 1 pm and does whatever he wants (which is literally just playing video games until 3 am) and only leaves his room to get food, etc. 

So basc my mom?s thought process is that if we kick him out of the house he?ll be forced to try and get his life together, and this sounds perfectly reasonable. However, my concern comes in that he has really severe depression since i can remember, doesn?t have many friends, literally has zero motivation in life whatsoever ... so I feel like removing his comfort and family could end up tragically. I suggested getting my brother a therapist (he?s had one before but he just doesn?t like going), but my dad responded that it makes no sense to take him to a therapist until he wants to improve his life, which makes sense as he currently doesn?t care about his future or wellbeing whatsoever. Oh and he strongly refuses to take meds that were prescribed by his psychiatrist (from when he was in high school) for his depression and adhd since he says it gets rid of his personality.

175,petunia3067,[new],5,c78mj7,4,"My bf (45M) and I (40F)  have lived together for a year and a half. We have his daughter (8F) parttime.  My bf has a 'best mate' (50M) that he sees at least once a day sometimes 2 or more times a day.  Brian will call my bf in between visits incessantly. My bf will bring him to the shops with us and when we drop him home Brian will get out of the car and say to my bf ""call me when you get home"".  Like wtf?  We just spent hours with you. What is there even to talk about??  When I start to get visibly annoyed by this constant contact that interrupts everything we do my bf resorts to lying and sneaking around to go and see this man.  

The lying involves - calling me to tell me hes still at work when he has already left work and he is at Brians house.  Saying hes going to the supermarket and be gone for an hour or more.  I've resorted to checking his receipts which show he has paid for items, literally, 10mins before arriving home. So where was he for the other 50mins?  My guess is Brians house.    Brian will ring after 9pm at night and ask my bf to take him to a shop so he can buy tobacco.  And my bf does it.  If Brian needs groceries guess whos taking him?  

I would understand if it you offered your mate a lift to the shop once in while but this guy does not have a licence,  or a job or a clean criminal record. Hes also a petty thief. I know that my bf lends him money that he doesn't pay it back. Once when I knew Brian owed my bf money and Brian was down at the pub drinking I asked why can't he pay the money back if hes got money to drink? My bf got all defensive and said he can't deny a man a beer.  

Yesterday my bf had to work in the morning and was going to be home by midday.  I pottered around all morning cleaning and tidying so all the jobs were done so we could do some projects together or go out to do something when he got home. 

A half hour after he was supposed to be home he called me to say he was going to Brians house for a quick cuppa and he'd be home soon. Two hours later he arrived home and I asked what he was doing... He told me Brian and him just caught up and watched a movie! A fucking movie. I think he could've at least called me to say that he was going to be 2 hours so I could've done something else with my afternoon.  

I've tried talking to him about this. Multiple times.  We've had huge fights where I state my case and end up getting called derogatory names like a 'delusional bitch' or a 'c**nt'.  I've told him he needs to make boundaries with Brian and stop being deceiptful.  

This makes feel disrespected and unappreciated. Help.

176,domingo1988,Relationships,6,c78m11,0,"I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years, 1 and half of which we've been living together. In hindsight was way too fast, but he had to move out of his house, so it sped up the whole process. Not long after living together I noticed how depressed he was. My boyfriend is originally from Spain and I'm Dutch and we live together in the Netherlands.

So 6 month ago we had a massive fall out over Christmas when his mum was over. I went through his phone and saw videos mesaages of this guy saying: ""Hey I don't want to pressure you, but I want to see you again"" etc. I knew if I would confront him, he would deny the whole thing. So I went on grindr to look for this guy and ask him about it. The guy said they had two dates and he didn't know he wasn't single. He also told me that they had sex... As you can imagine my entire Christmas and New Year's was ruined.

Fast forward a couple of months. So I decided to forgive him and were still together. Meanwhile my boyfriend has fallen further into his depression. He hasn't worked since November and some days he can barely get out of bed. He smokes weed all day to cope and barely does anything in the house. I work full time and am in charge of getting groceries, paying rent, tidying up etc. Whenever we have a fall out it's mostly because in his eyes I expect to much from him since he's so severely depressed. I also get blamed for not being cold and not being emotional enough (I might have Asperger's and I'm seeing a psychologist for that). Some fights get out of when with him breaking stuff and locking me out of our house.

Since he cheated I've been more suspicious than I was before. I added his Grindr profile as favourite to see if he logged in and talked to other people. In the last couple of months he has been talking to other guys. He met up with 2 of them but nothing happened. I got really mad at him for it, but he said he did it because he feels lonely being depressed and being away from his home country.

A couple of weeks ago I noticed a change in behaviour. He started acting really suspicious. Whenever I would look at him when he was on his phone he would get mad. One time he came running out of the shower when he thought I was going through his phone. After some investigation I find out he's been texting this guy. We have another fall out and he locks me out of our house again. I have to stay with my mum. The next day we talk and he said he was talking to him but they never met. He promises me that he'll block him everywhere. And he wants to work on the relationship. At this point there a still things that don't add up for me. I log into his bank account on his computer and see a suspicious transfer. 58 euro to the guys bank account. Mind you, he hasn't been paying rent for months or paid for groceries since he's unemployed. I confront him and he says the guy needed money and he felt sorry for him. He said he would pay him back the week after, but since he blocked him he doubt that would ever happen.

Today is Saturday. I left the house to rehearse with my friend who has a band and I'm singing backing vocals. After rehearsal my boyfriend texts me that he wants us to clean the house tomorrow during the day. I said I don't want to clean during the day, since I work full time and I barely get to enjoy a day out in the sun. So I say I could set my alarm and clean by myself so he can sleep. This conversation somehow escalated. I'm not being considerate because when I set an alarm I wake him up and he has trouble sleeping.

When I get home I'm locked out of the house again and my bags are outside the front door. I leave and I get spoken WhatsApp messages of him crying and telling me how inconsiderate I am of his feelings. For speaking the day rehearsing and for not wanting to clean on his terms. He tells me I'm not a good person and I'm exhausted from being with an depressed person but to scared to leave him. After wandering around I sit down with a couple of beers on a bench. I decide to download Grindr again. In my favourites there's the guy he's been talking to weeks ago. I don't have a photo on my profile, since I only used it to spy on my boyfriend, so I start talking to the guy. I ask him when I'm going to get my 58 euros back. He thinks I'm my boyfriend and says things like: ""you say your boyfriend is psycho but you're the same. I thought the deal was that we would split the hotel since I already paid for the train."" At this point my blood is boiling. I try to to call my boyfriend but my calls are diverted to voicemail. I go home and knock on the door but he doesn't open. His key is in the door so I can't get in. I text him and said I want him out by next week.

I'm at my mum's know. I'm not sure how I feel exactly. I know I'm not a good person for going through my boyfriend's phone and checking his bank account and spying on him on Grindr. I haven't heard his side yet, bu I don't think want to be in this relationship anymore. At the same time I feel weird about leaving someone who's too depressed to leave the house and has suicidal thoughts. He has 500 euro to his name, his family lives in Spain and there is barely anyone to help him. Am I doing the right thing?

I ended up moving from MA to Los Angeles to focus on continuing to grow but was pretty happy for her that she was doing alright.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We still kept up via text & occasionally would talk on the phone but it wasn't super often or anything, maybe once every week or two. A few months after I had moved, there was a period where I hadn't really heard from her so I decided I'd give her a call and see how things have been and she was super brief in saying she couldn't really be on the phone and she'd call me later. A few days later at work she lets me know the guy doesn't like her around other dudes and threatened to kick her out on the street if he ""caught her"" speaking with any guys. I told her it didn't really sound healthy but if she ever needed anything let me know and I'd try and help, and that was it for a few months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the start of this year and I get a call from her best friend letting me know my ex has been super off lately and her friend wanted me to see if I could maybe ""Crack the shell"" so to speak and see what's been going on. So we start talking for a bit and I find out the guy has gone and beaten her pretty good a few times, at one point hitting her in the face and chipping a tooth which she told everyone she trip and fell down the front steps of their apartment. At this point I offer to send her enough to get a room and get out of their for long enough to get back on her feet but she lets me know he's held a gun to his head before and threatened to kill himself if she leaves so she feels ""stuck"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've gone back to MA a few times and when we hang out she's super on edge because she's terrified of the dude, and since that point I've offered to fly her out here to LA and just let her get on her feet. She's been planning to move out this way since when we were kids so I always get the same response of ""You know I want to, but I can't do that to him, if he does anything to himself it's on my head"" and the conversation just kinda dies from there. This has been going on for a few months and I seriously want to try doing something to help because I hate seeing her in this situation but she's basically refusing any sort of help and trapping herself in her situation.

&#x200B;

I?m in college and have had a very tough time in the relationship area of life. I have never been asked out, on a date, kissed, etc. and I suspect it might have to do with the way people interpret my personality. I guess I can come off as cold, uncaring, emotionless, a little bold, etc. even though I try to show my emotions so people don?t think that.

For me, I take relationships very seriously and I don?t catch feelings often. I usually only start liking someone after I know them as a friend.

Anyway, I have this guy friend who I have known for several years. We are not in each other?s immediate friend groups but we do hang out and see each other around fairly often. I started developing feelings for him a few months ago. I was just finished getting over a very close friend of mine who hurt me terribly (admitted feelings for each other, it was really exciting, and then he backed out on it but continued leading me on for months). So I wasn?t exactly trying to do this all over again lol.

I could spend ages trying to figure out if this guy likes me back or not but I don?t think it?s worth it to ruminate. Basically, I?m considering just ripping off the band-aid and telling him I have feelings for him. I?m afraid that if I don?t, my feelings will get worse and I?ll end up hurting more than it would if we just talked about it. I?m aware that it might risk the friendship, but my past experience tells me that it won?t hurt the friendship if it?s one worth keeping.

He is the shy, overly polite type and even if he has feelings I think he?d be extremely cautious about mentioning it. He made a joke about asking me out once last year, I shut him down and he got really upset (it was stupid of me, i know, pls dont attack me). I think that because of the kind of person he is and the great relationship we have already, it?d be stupid to pass up an opportunity that neither of us might have expected.

Anyway, is it worth it to just say something?

**1.**  **Medical Student 1**

I am a medical student and research papers are important for matching to a good residency program. One day, I met a patient that had the same issue as a friend of mine many years ago. I ended up seeing the patient, suggesting the treatment and it was decided it would be a case study. Sensing it would be a good opportunity, I agreed to do the report on the spot. The supervisor texted me that it was mine and I would be first author. While walking to class the next day, I ran into her last year?s research assistant (worked for her for a year). We weren?t friends (he?s a year ahead of me) but I was making small talk. I mentioned how I had shadowed her in clinic and she was awesome?she gave me a case report to do! Long story short? he used this information and went back to her and asked her if he could guide me through the report. He inserted himself as the middle man. He would forward me the case documents (that she would say please share this with <my name>). I was writing everything. He also sent me a cover page and listed himself as first author. I was nervous (because he was a year older and I didn?t want to seem greedy) but I tried to be cool and mentioned I was under the impression I would be first based off my conversations with the supervisor. At this point (I was made aware of this from the supervisor after) he started texting her saying he was doing all the work and asking her to confirm that he would be first. When she confirmed this, he got back to me saying she had told him he was first. That the person who writes the abstract goes first. He told me I would write this paper and he would go first and the next paper, he would write the entirety of it and then I would go first. I knew this was a lie so I finally spoke to the supervisor. Meanwhile, he was still messaging me (I was just not responding). He was telling me the supervisor asked him to send him my work. I literally screenshotted this and sent it to the supervisor. He was caught in a lie. She never said that, he cancelled the meeting, he told her he was doing everything, etc.

&#x200B;

**2.**  **Resident Student 1**

I started an innovative program at my medical school. I was having lunch with my friend?s boyfriend at the time and we were talking about my new project, the meeting for which was coming up in 3 days. He told me he was involved in some research in the field and asked if he could join the meeting.  I said sure, why not? Everyone knew this was my meeting/project. I had arranged it 3 months prior and was communicating with everyone for months. Moreover, it was based off the same program I completed elsewhere earlier in the semester. The meeting went well. Everyone was on board and wanted the project to move forward. He came to a second meeting. When the time came to recruit juniors, I told him I was going to be DIRECTOR and he would be ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. I had been working on this project for about \~6 months prior to him coming onto it. He wanted to be FOUNDER. I couldn?t give that to him because, well? he wasn?t. His point was that he would be making the inaugural curriculum with me and as such, he would be founding the program. I said that I founded the program when I arranged the meeting, and team to help me see the program out. It turned into a bitter fight. He kept harassing me to get on the phone and he just wore me down. He told me to email him that we were CO DIRECTORS and equal in everything. In the end, my supervisors got wind of this and were upset. As my supervisors, they stepped in. It was a nightmare

&#x200B;

**3.**  **Resident Student 2**

I worked at a research institute in my first summer and there was a resident who also did research there for another supervisor. We never worked together on anything but we met when his supervisor introduced us because he does research in the area of the innovative project I was creating above. After the meeting, we began texting. I expressed some concern because we both did research at the same place and I didn?t want our supervisors to find out (not that there was anything wrong with us dating but I just rather they didn?t know). Anyways, I decided to keep seeing him but he turned out to be a pretty big jerk. I decided to end it with him. I did it nicely ?It?s been great getting to know you but I think we want different things, best of luck with your applications.? He threatened me. Verbatim ?It?s just so negative. I feel like I need to tell <research institute> about it. In the future, I need to keep work and sex separate. I will likely do it this week. I will let you know. I?m sorry if it ends up affecting you, I really am.? He then asked me to speak on the phone ?I feel like we just need to speak. Just for 3 minutes J?

Anyway, these have all been horrible situations. They are all with men and I?m wondering if this is a me problem. Not speaking up for myself, etc. I?m pretty strong when pushed but I think I might be passive until that point. I know it?s not my team work skills as I ended up recruiting Jr. Coordintors for my project and had NO issue with them. My supervisor at the research institute I worked for hired me back and has called me a ?mover and shaker.? Does anyone have any outside perspective maybe about why this keeps happening to me?

185,aiaab-throwaway,[new],4,c785yr,4,"To be clear, I don?t have a problem with my brother?s sexuality. I found out he was bi a while back and support him completely. But I don?t support his relationship with his boyfriend.

First of all, there?s the age gap. I don?t feel like I have to explain this one. I wouldn?t want to date a woman 15 years older than me (except maybe Rachel McAdams, AJ Cook or Zoe Saldana, but it?s not like that would ever actually happen). Too big an age gap and it would be like dating your parent. 

Which brings us to my second point - my brother has daddy issues. 

Some background: my brother found out he was adopted when he was seventeen but even before that he believed Dad didn?t love him as much as he loved me, and that he punished him too much and scared him. Sure, he was harsh sometimes, but it was like my brother was trying to annoy him on a lot of those occasions, trying to prove him right instead of proving himself whenever he was criticised. And sure Dad was aggressive after our mother died, but he was grieving. Around this time my brother kept provoking him and things were especially tense at home. He kept insisting that no one wanted him or loved him now Mum was gone and that he was going to kill himself (he?d already attempted twice before). They must have had some kind of serious argument because I came home one day to find my brother had moved out. It wasn?t the first time - he?d run away from home twice as a teenager and both times it was only our mother who could get him to come back. He ignored my calls for a while and when he finally spoke to me, he said he was never talking to our dad again.

So basically he?s a bit of a mess. Fast forward a month or two then in comes an older man who decides he?s the best thing in the world, and suddenly my brother is a completely different person. It?s almost as if he?s changing himself for this guy - he?s started wearing more feminine clothing and stuff (like heels and nail polish), he?s put on weight (he used to be super skinny so he?s not fat, just more regular sized but it?s still weird), and he?s going to parties when he was basically a complete recluse before. I found out recently that they sometimes smoke weed together and I don?t think my brother touched any kind of drugs before getting with this guy.

He?s also never used the word abusive to describe our father before, but suddenly he?s decided he was abused. He told me this as if he expected me to agree and not defend our father, especially against an accusation from someone known to be melodramatic (seriously, he?s SO melodramatic, anything could end up being like the end of the world to him). When I did, he got all upset and acted like I was betraying him.

I wanted to be happy for him. My brother seems to really like this guy and he?s never had a serious relationship before (or at least not one where he?s introduced me). But on top of all this, I think this guy?s a dick. When I met him, he was way too affectionate with my brother (who was NEVER physically affectionate before but was practically cuddling him in the booth) and to some extent with me, way too touchy-feely, and he seems to get distracted mid conversation all the time. My brother says he?s just ?eccentric? and ?flamboyant? and that he likes it, but it pissed me off.

When I tried to talk to him about it, my brother got really pissed off. He?s got an excuse for everything (the age gap is fine because they?re both adults and dating pools for gay and bi men are smaller, the change in behaviour is because he?s ?free? and ?healthier? now, everyone experiments with drugs at some point, he really likes this guy and ?nothing else should matter?), and he insisted I?m trying to ruin his happiness ?just like our father? when I kept pushing for answers. I told him I was worried his boyfriend would take advantage of him or hurt him, and he just laughed in my face and said [boyfriends name] was the only man who had never hurt him. He accused me of being homophobic and claimed this all being about me not wanting to see him in a relationship with a man, and said that if I couldn?t accept it, he?d cut me out too. He?s always been difficult and dramatic, but this is next level. I love my brother and I don?t want to lose him to some weird guy, but it seems like he?d choose said weird guy over me if he had to. How do I handle this?

When we met, I knew he had depression, anxiety and severe mental health issues (prior suicide attempts, self-harm etc.) He's also an alcoholic and one-pack-a-day smoker. Over the course of the relationship, he's started on medication that is helping with the general depression. He still has really bad days when he spends all day in bed with a panic attack and literally can't do anything (doesn't even drink or smoke!)

He's been trying hard to manage his mental health since we've been together. I have depression and mental health issues myself, so this is something I'm willing to work together and stand by him through. I know I can never ""fix"" him and that I need to take care of myself first. He is incredibly loving and sweet, we have fun together and truly enjoy each others' company.

2 months ago, he was laid off from work due to the company down-sizing. The timing is awful since we're in the middle of moving to a new apartment. His severance helped cover his part of the deposits and rents, but we have to tighten our budget for moving costs and the future. He has tried to cut down on drinking but still spends about $600/week. He gets angry when I bring up this up and I've become very hesitant to at all. The ""bad days"" are more frequent and he will spend days in bed. He's expressed that he's lost a sense of purpose because he can't provide for us (he was making over $100k) and one day, he self-harmed. I've suggested he go to therapy but he gets angry about that. 

After a talk where we laid out our plan of actions, he successfully signed up for unemployment. But then when I try to urge him to do the next steps (COBRA and apply for ACA insurance/get on my insurance, either start looking for work or looking into career counseling because he hates his field/job) he gets angry. Over the next few weeks, I'd gently check in but it would lead to fights. Some things he's said whenever I bring it up are that he feels reluctant to do stuff because of that feeling when ""you're about to do something anyway, then someone tells you to do it and now you don't want to."" He's said that it felt like I was trying to make his problems about me or trying to start drama. When he's drunk, he says he loves me, he's afraid of losing me, that he feels so guilty that he's just sitting around doing nothing while I'm at work all day. When he's sober (which is rare now,) he says he needs help and will do anything it takes, is really receptive to plans etc but will whine/get angry when it's time to act.

Today, I realized he's running out of time to get new insurance/get on my insurance (based on the ""qualifying life event"" policy) so I asked about it, which led to a big fight, him storming off and refusing to talk to me. I'm now re-thinking putting him on my insurance and moving in at the end of July (which would be a huge disadvantage for him since his current apartment has already been rented to someone new.) I'm wondering if I should back out of moving in but try to stay together (which I don't think he'd take well) or break up outright or stay and try to make it through this rough patch? Obviously he's in a hard situation and that can make anyone unstable, let alone someone with poor mental health.

I have also talked to him a few times how important it is for him to not drink to excess again. He acknowledged it and apologized. However, since the incident there were perhaps 3~4 times of him having way too many drinks for my liking(6+ standard drinks) at parties/nights out and yesterday he went out with his friends and drank to the point of puking. 


I am just absolutely fuming and was worried to the point of unable to sleep last night. I haven't seen him since yesterday but he has kept in touch with me throughout the night and we texted breifly just now when he woke up briefly. He then went back to bed to nurse his hangover. 


I expressed disappointment breifly but I also know that it's not the time to discuss this when he's still hungover. 


Admittedly I have a fiery temper and I am just about to boil over. I just don't know how to effectively communicate it again without me blowing my top.


He has been a loving, respectful and supportive and transparent partner in other ways, and has given me no other reasons to suspect anything else, and I want a future with him. But is an ultimatum appropriate here? If yes, how do I phrase it and communicate effectively? Thank you!

191,Rez31b,[new],2,c77lay,1,"  So in mid May my wife (24f) told me she wants a divorce out of the blue after a week of almost complete silent treatment, while I was out of town for two weeks. This is the second time this has happened and both times she immediately turned around and jumped in bed with other people less than a week after telling me. Both times it ripped me to shreds.
 A few weeks after this started and I had found out that she was seeing other guys I decided to try a dating app and just kind of see what would happen. I ended up talking to a girl (29f) and we hit it off really well so we started dating officially. Early on we figured out that that our ex's actually worked together and they're really good friends. We decided to keep talking anyway and just not tell them.
  Shortly thereafter my ex and I were trying to be friends and proceeded to tell each other about our relationships. She was surprised that I had gotten a girlfriend so soon, then she figured out who my girlfriend was and that's when shit got really complicated. She started telling me about how horrible of a person my gf is and that she's engaged and living with a guy and all this other stuff. I blew off pretty much everything she said due to it being second hand information and I chalked it up to jealousy or something like that.
  I ended up confronting my gf about her being engaged about a week later which she pretty much confessed to right away, and went on to explain that he was cheating on her and other stuff but she had nowhere she could go with her kids. I told her that I felt that if that she was with him we couldn't be anymore than friends unless that changed, she brought up a point I couldn't really argue with that I'm essentially with my ex. I told her I would think about it which lasted less than a day and we we're back together. But I told my ex that we had broken up and we we're just friends.
  My ex told me that while I was seeing my gf that she wouldn't say anything to her friend (my gf's ex). So she told her friend that my gf and I had been seeing each other. According to the friend my gf's sort-of-fiancee has hurt the kid they have together in the past. Well between my ex and her friend they're saying that she left the kids with her fiancee to see me. He is also threatening to expose my gf and I relationship to her fiancee and if is planning on doing so Monday when he has their kid, which I found out about today, but I haven't told my gf about it (according to my ex who I'm on really really bad terms with now it's ""confidential information"") and I'm not sure whether to stay out of it or warn my gf. I hate almost everything about this situation the only things that give me any kind of happiness lately are my kids, my literally 3 friends, and my girlfriend. I haven't done anything more than kiss this girl and a little sexting in the 3 weeks we've been talking. I have no idea what to do at this point my head is so screwed I don't know what to do.

Tl;Dr My girlfriend and I are divorcing our ex's but they're friends with each other and I am screwed up emotionally and mentally because all of the drama that's been happening but my gf is one of 3 things that have kept me from going to a really dark place due to the divorce thing.

I found out he was waiting to dump me after we went to an event we had tickets for in a couple weeks. 
I am very sad because I still love him, but I realized how terrible I?ve been treated lately.  I would bring up how I felt unappreciated and taken for granted and he basically didn?t do anything with that. 
He put me down, belittled me and didn?t appreciate me. 
So when I found out he was going to dump me, I took matters into my own hands and broke up with him this morning. 

He was so mean. Basically said ?yeah I?m not fucking into it. I want things to be fresh and exciting? 
I would do so much for him, surprise him with things, leave him love notes, etc. 
So I said ?you don?t want to work on the relationship? and he said ?this early on? There?s no point.?

I am crushed. Heartbroken. I loved him so much but it was the right thing to do. 
Just sad now and looking for some support and advice on how I can move forward without dwelling on it. 

I keep thinking about what he?ll tell his friends and family about me. I still love him. I didn?t want to do it, but I think it was the right thing to do. 

He goes through girls quite a lot. A new girlfriend every six months. He said he wants things to be fresh and exciting, but I did ALL the work. Surprised him with tickets, left him love notes, planned fun things. He didn?t do anything. I don?t know how that?s my fault.

195,needselfcontrol26,[new],9,c779lg,2,"This is gonna be **really** **long** and **really frustrating** for some to read. Bear with me. just a disclaimer- yep, know I'm not the smartest for staying as long as I did. tl;dr for this mess at the bottom.

So, I met him in our first year of university, at a party. Pretty typical scenario- we didn't hookup or anything, but made out and danced awhile and exchanged numbers. I learned that he lived right by my university (he went to a different one, where the party was at- our area isn't too big) so it was easy to meet up. For 8 months, we hung out, were intimate, went on 'dates' (he would never call them that, and I was too scared to rock the boat). We made a lot of really good memories together. I was in a really formative period of my life (I was a late bloomer, shy as heck in high school, and was a bit of an ugly duckling until university hit) so our time together felt really meaningful, even though looking back on it, it wasn't too groundbreaking.

He never brought up the idea of being exclusive or in a relationship. And me, with my inexperience, didn't question him on it. I would ask friends if this was normal, and at first they said yes. But when 5, 6 months passed by, I realized that there was something he was clearly avoiding. In the 6th month, I finally wrung up courage to ask him- and I got the typical 'I can't commit, I don't know if I want a relationship' speech.

That being said, we still continued to hang out. and then at 7 ish months, he asked me (what I assume was a fit of random emotion) to be his girlfriend. Obviously I was elated- the guy I pined after for months finally wanted me back. It didn't last long- I don't quite remember how long, but it was bound to end. He had moved into his fraternity's house over the summer, so he was thrust into a setting of parties, drugs, alcohol, and sex at literally all hours of the day. He was struggling with school too, and downing energy drink after energy drink, smoking, taking adhd medications to focus....it was a lot. He wasn't sleeping, stressing out a ton, and taking it out on me. The day he broke up with me pretty much devastated me- for months I wondered what I had done wrong. It was really one of the worst times of my life. I had such a hard time forgetting all of our memories, and I would wake up in tears almost all of the time.

But I went on with my life, somehow. For a year, I stayed relatively single. I downloaded tinder and met a guy once, but I didn't do much dating or sleeping around. It was a good year- as affected as I still was, I went on with my life in the best way I could.

Then a year later, I ended up going to a party at his fraternity's house. Even though I tell people that I wouldn't have known if he would be there or not, I knew it was an excuse for myself. I knew he'd be there- and he was. But instead of rejecting me and ignoring me (like I thought he would), he sought me out and talked to me. We went on a walk, caught up, and then of course....I was in a taxi with him to his place and we had sex. yay! smart decisions.

And so began round 2 with this guy, which lasted about a year or so- and it was one of the worst years of my life. Again, he would ice me out. But this time, it was even worse- there was no hanging out outside of his place, I couldn't ask him certain questions (what he did for work, what classes he took, etc), no social media. But we would still have our long conversations about life, our jokes, the little things that my very very broken heart and soul attached themselves too like a lifeline. I felt addicted to him. He then became more and more emotionally cold- and at times, physically forceful. This time around I had more of a voice- I called him out when I could. But it never worked. It ended with him finally telling me to never speak to him again, to ignore him if I saw him, and I was blocked. I had an hour to cry about it, called a friend, then I quit him cold turkey. It was hard, but easier to leave him this time.

That was three years ago. I met new people, started and ended relationships, etc, and moved on with my life. While no one ever made me feel the way he did, I got close with some. This year, I felt like I finally got to a point where I could forgive myself, and forgive him.

But then, lo and behold, a month and a half ago, he texted me, and asked me to catch up. This was crazy to me, mainly because- he was never the one to text me first. Never the one to engage with me, it was always me first. And back I fell into old ways. We would meet, would hook up, then talk about the past again. He had grown and changed a bit. Then out of nowhere over text one day, he told me that someone wanted to be exclusive with him and that we should end. He called me, and my emotions were everywhere. I was hurt, and angry. Why was someone else allowed to date him, to be exclusive, to ask him things about his life and be let in, when I wasn't? What was so wrong with me, that he couldn't even tell me that? I finally ended up telling him that I was done, and that I never wanted him to speak to me again.

A week later, he texted me again. Saying that he still wanted to have me in his life. We spoke over text a bit, but I kept it short. I thought about it for a few days, and then decided that knowing he was with someone else hurt too much. Being held at arms length (we could text, but not always....we couldn't hang out, we couldn't phone call) was not something I wanted to do. So I told him over text, and he immediately (again, something he NEVER did before) called me to tell me to reconsider. He asked to see me the next day. I obliged.

I expected to just meet and talk, and tell him that this time I was fully done. That I couldn't do this. So we talked. I asked him if he thought about her when he was fucking me, and he looked at me as if I had grown a second head. He also would never say that he wouldn't be with me- but he never would say that he would. He would just say that our 'personalities clashed'. And then...he got intimate with me again. Which completely screwed things over in my mind- didn't he just say that someone wanted to be exclusive with him? It wasn't just sex though- it was holding each other for hours, it was him asking me to stay the night, it was forehead kisses and hand holding and all the things that my heart and body were addicted to for so long.

I left, and told myself this would be the last time. He asked me to hang out again, and it was the same thing. Sweet conversations, heartfelt intimacy. And now, I am torn.

I know I need to end this. He's so ingrained into my being that I feel helpless, and lost. I should know better- if I ask him to get to know me better (and not see me as the 19 year old girl he met so long ago), he wouldn't say no- he'd skirt around the question. He'd do that if I asked him to be exclusive, or to date me. Its clear that we have no future, and every part of me is addicted again, beyond belief. I feel chained. He keeps coming back and insisting that I am so insanely special to him, but here I am again- chasing a high. I'm so tired. I want a love that makes me feel like he did, with someone that wants to be with me. But I feel like I'm stuck.

Edit: I texted him to meet in person so I could end things (I didn't quite tell him that) and he replied, and now I'm losing my nerve. I don't know what's wrong with me.

&#x200B;

Also, I want to add that it feels like my brain sees him as my ideal guy- looks, personality, everything- which makes it even harder for me to quit him.  

&#x200B;

I left a lot of things out (a lot of the stuff he said) because this is a freaking insane wall of text already.

But I didn?t mind, because I was just as addicted to him as he is to me; we are very much addicted to each other. 

But sometimes he gets into those moments or phases where he turns a bit cold again, won?t really talk to me, says that our relationship is already dead and that he wants to leave... then I get all nervous and nearly beg him to stay and reconsider, and I let him know that I want to do everything I can to rekindle the passion we once had for one another. 

He?s given me hope by saying that he?s still attracted to me, and still loves me deeply and has no eyes for any other girl except me.

197,VypreStrike,[new],2,c775sf,1,"So I actually met this girl over 3 years ago, and we had a couple of pretty friendly interactions but ultimately didn't talk much. I've been following her on instagram for over a year and a half now, but again I had no interaction with her until recently, when her dad came to my school to give a presentation 2? 3? months ago.

At that time, I didn't actually know that this man was her dad, but I had the suspicion since I recognized the last name, so I shot her a DM asking if her dad was a doctor and if he gave a presentation at my school, and I managed to get a nice conversation started.

Fast forward to now, 2-3 months later, and we're still talking, but the conversation is really fecken slow. I'm always the one who has to initiate the conversations, which I've honestly gotten used to at this point from talking to other people. I always reply to her messages within a minute of receiving them, but it takes her days sometimes to reply. When she does reply, she tends to stay active for ten minutes or so, and we can have surprisingly productive dialogue that she *seems* to enjoy. But after those ten minutes, she disappears again.

We've talked about some pretty deep stuff and her answers always seem to have some amount of effort put into them, so no one word answers. I've also seen that her responses have become more casual, with more slang and emojis tossed in. I feel like that would suggest that she at least enjoys talking to me, even if she doesn't consider me to be her actual friend since we don't even go to the same school.

With that being said, while she seems to have gotten more friendly, she also seems to reply less and less often. When our conversation first started, she would reliably reply every few hours at most. As of writing this, her last reply was 2 days ago.

Assuming I haven't already been ghosted, should I ask her if she actually enjoys talking to me and is just too busy to talk, or if she's just acting friendly out of politeness and isn't answering because she wants me to leave her alone?

If anyone has had any experience with this, I really want some good advice, since I might be building up a bit of a crush on this girl and don't want to dive too deep if it's obvious that she just wants me to fuck off.

I've moved into an awesome job in an awesome new career field. I'm good at this, I love every minute of it, and doors are opening for me already. Things are good. 

I hired this woman a while back. It's an hourly position, one of many that we employ, but based on her interest and expertise she primarily works directly under me. Of course, at this point, I'm in full-blown crush mode. 

On the one hand, I can only see infinite problems with this. My employer has clear rules that would prohibit any sort of relationship between us, and I'd suffer the consequences if action was deemed necessary. The conflict of interest of a subordinate / supervisor relationship is obvious. If we started something and anything went sideways, we'd have to grapple with the impact on our professional lives too - and vice versa. Even assuming that we're both paragons of maturity, if other people knew about it, the gossip would flow, and people could get the idea that there's special treatment and cause trouble no matter how we're actually conducting ourselves. It also frankly makes me feel really scummy that I'm crushing on my employee. 

On the other hand... I think this is legit. We're the same age, have plenty in common, and she's just fucking cool as all getout. I'm as sure as I can be that she's into me too. We've each gone out of our way to end up at the same group outings once we knew the other would be there. We stay up late texting about bullshit. The friendly physical contact escalates and lingers. The more that I get to know her, the more I feel like we'd have a shot if something real if it's what we both wanted. 

I'm not just looking for a lay, I've crushed on colleagues before and know how to work through it and get back to business. This is different, at least for me. But I just can't see a way to do this right without being way too forward/presumptuous. I also think we'd have to keep it an absolute secret, which probably ain't the healthiest. I don't want to stop spending time with her, but I also am pretty damn sure that something is going to happen between us sooner or later, for better or worse.

theyve always been curious about their gender and sexuality and has also expressed, what feels like to me as gender dysphoria. i am familiar with this feeling as i went through the same thing when i questioned my own gender. the past few weeks, we have been talking a lot about their own identity and it?s obvious that they have some trouble trying to figure out if they are trans or not. i?ve been supporting them and how they feel throughout this whole thing because i know how it felt being in their position and not having any support. the thing is, i?m not too sure how to process this as well because i?m no expert in gender dysphoria. i dont know if i?m pointing them in the right direction and i dont know if i?m validating them or not. there?s just a lot of room to fuck this up, i feel. however, i?ve encouraged them to go and see a gender therapist to help them with how they feel about this just so theres an expert weighing in. they?ve followed my suggestion and has set up an appointment in a few weeks. 

i?ve told my ex that i?m always there for them, and will also support them in what they want and need. i love them with all my heart but i think between readjusting to a new place, settling down, and me trying to get over them romantically, i?m just not sure how i feel about everything. there?s just a lot of things to process and i don?t know if i?m in the right position to give advice despite my own experience with it. i really don?t want to fuck them up especially since i?m the only person that knows about what they?re going through. i just don?t know what to do and i don?t think i currently have the emotional capability of giving anyone advice but i?m the only one that they?re running to for it. plus, do i even have the right to be whiny about this? i don?t know what to tell them at this point.

tldr; my ex is questioning their gender and it?s been hard for the both of us to process. i?m the only one that knows but i?ve been going through some stuff as well so not sure how to give advice especially since i dont think im capable of giving it right now.",1561856198.0,My (18) ex partner (20) is questioning their gender and I?m not really sure how to deal with it?,1.0

I  really just want genuine feedback here.  I don't know if I'm out of  line, or if I have any right to feel a certain amount of jealousy.

I've  been in a relationship with this guy for the past year and we've had a  great relationship so far.  A little background, I come from very  horrible, abusive relationships (I'm in my mid-30's now) and haven't  ever really had a ""normal"" relationship.  I also come from serious abuse  from my childhood which causes me to have severe PTSD/social  anxiety/depression issues.  He is very aware of this and has been from  the very beginning.  I've been very open about my past as I feel it's  best to reveal this in the beginning so there's no surprises in a  relationship.  I would never want to put a guy in a relationship with me  with these issues if they weren't at a point to handle that kind of  relationship.  From the very beginning we had an immediate connection  and hit it off.  He has been nothing short of amazing, sympathetic,  compassionate, caring, and genuinely concerned for my well-being.  He  also has a little bit of background in psychology, so it helps in him  being able to ""deal"" with my issues, so to speak.

With  that being said, one of the issues we have is that we're in a  long-distance relationship.  It's been very hard for both of us and  we're currently in communication about changing that.  We're both very  serious about one another.  The problem that I'm having, aside from the  distance issue, is that he is still close with his ex girlfriend.  As  in, they still work together and hang out to some extent (like go out to  lunch and whatnot).  I knew of this dynamic from the very beginning, so  this was never a surprise to me.  They broke up a few years ago and  decided they were better off as friends.  I'm mature enough to accept  that, however, I'm starting to find myself feel extremely jealous  thinking about them spending time together.  My boyfriend is a genuinely  nice guy and struggles to see what the issue is, because in his mind  (apparently) there's nothing going on and it's just ""work stuff"".  But I  can't help but find myself getting lost in jealous and suspicious  thoughts, especially since we live so far away from one another.  I  don't have an issue with her, per say, she does seem like a nice woman  from what I gather, although never talked to her.  I just can't help but  feel exceedingly jealous at the thought of them spending time together.   I'm trying to be as rational and mature about this as possible (we're  all adults here), but at the same time I have a hard time processing  difficult things like this (like jealousy issues) and I've been cheated  on in the past.  As mature as I want to be here, I also don't want to be  naive.  Is it wrong to feel uncomfortable with them spending time  together?  Is it wrong for me to put my foot down and say I'm not okay  with it?  I brought up the abuse issues because I have problems  understanding what are ""normal"" thoughts and what are not.  I was in  relationships where men told me my thoughts were wrong on a regular  basis, so this is where I struggle here...Like I said, we've recently  had very serious conversations about changing the long-distance issue  and that would be a major move for both of us (literally and  figuratively).  I really do love him and I know he loves me too.  I'm  just really at a crossroads here...

205,mainthrowaway11,[new],5,c76qid,1,"Background: I've never been in a relationship before, and it scares me big time.  I had a ton of anxiety in high school and never even kissed a girl until after senior year. I did go to a therapist back then, and I do think it helped a bit.  Now I'm a rising junior in college.

This girl slid into my DM's in January and we started hooking up.  It was on and off, and I would go to her room as often as once or twice a week with periods of once every two or three weeks.  Early on, she wanted to go on a date, and we went on one but that was it.  My mindset in the beginning was sort of just ""fuck it, might as well"" because she was pretty insistent over DM's and quickly arranged for me to come over one night.  She kept asking me to come over, and was a bit possessive.  For example: I told her I would come over one Saturday night, but while I was at a party that night I came down with a bad cold and ended up having the stomach flu.  So I told her that I couldnt come, but she kept questioning me and when I told her I was making myself some soup, she asked me to send her a photo of it, which I immediately did.

So as you can see, this was a horrible baseline to set for the ""relationship"".  There were no boundaries, and she would push me which would cause me to push back.  We kept up pretty much this exact pattern across the course of the semester, and although we weren't exclusive, I didn't end up hooking up with anyone else so we were sort of ""quasi-exclusive"".

During the summer, the ""relationship"" sort of moved forward, but only over text.  I live in a small town where theres not much to do and not many people to talk to, so I would sort of tell her my problems and she would talk to me about them, which I appreciated a lot.  We would sext a lot and she would send me nudes and stuff, it was just casual.  However she would often say how much she missed me and how much she likes me, even saying she was ""overwhelmed"" by how much she likes me.

Constantly in the back of her mind was the fact that I'm going abroad in the fall.  She kept talking about how she wanted to ""plan ahead"" to keep my interest while I was gone.  She was also constantly telling me about these other guys who seemed to be in love with her, constantly texting her to meet up but she said she was turning them down for me, which I never asked her to do.

Finally, she moved to the location where her internship is, which is pretty near me.  Her mother somehow agreed to buy us a hotel room just for the two of us even though she had another place to live with her friends.  I was excited to see her.  But then I started talking to some of my friends, and they were kind of reminding me how possessive she has acted and all the times she would question where I was or what I was doing even though we weren't dating.  Also, the fact that I hadn't seen her in person in so long made it hard to really determine my feelings.  I just didn't know how I felt.  For the past week, I acted a bit off with her because of all that, and she would constantly say how much she liked me and cared about me but I would respond with kind of neutral answers to avoid saying things that I dont mean because I DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL.  I was really excited to spend some time with her to really determine how I feel.

Well last night everything kind of came to a head when I told her that I could spend all of saturday night with her but had to leave sunday afternoon because I have a meeting for my internship (which is true although its a skype meeting, but I have a ton of work to do before that meeting which I honestly would have kind of been blowing off in order to go see her).  However, when I really reflect on it, I was sort of looking for a way to avoid spending all of sunday there, but it may be partially due to my own anxiety/insecurities and I've never been in a relationship before so I never know what to say and how to act.  She was drunk during this conversation and began asking ""what are we"".  She kept saying how much she likes and cares about me and how she just tries to keep our relationship fun, which really tears me up because no girl has ever been this nice to me or this into me before.  This morning she started asking about tonight, and I said:

> do you still want me to come? like do you understand that i have work to do and can?t spend saturday night and all of sunday? and in terms of what even is this, I was happy to keep it going because i do like you but you?ve gotta understand that i?m not trying to get into something exclusive right before I go abroad. i was excited about visiting but it?s your call if you want me to come or not.

and she responded:

> Yeah it?s probably just better if you don?t come. There?s no point in dragging things out.

This happened this morning, and I've been absolutely devastated about it all day, which is ridiculous because it's basically what I was asking for.  The problem is, I was really looking forward to this weekend to help me figure out how I feel about her, because it's been two months since we saw each other in person and at this point I just have absolutely no idea how I feel.  I really don't see the point in getting into a relationship right before I leave to go abroad, unless I was like head over heels in love of course.  One big issue I'm having is, what if a girl is never this into me again?  I just feel like I've never been in a relationship and I'm being an idiot for passing up on a nice, pretty, athletic girl. I don't KNOW why I'm not more into her: I think part of the reason is that the whole thing started as a hookup, which makes it so hard to separate sex from actual feelings.  I really wasn't expecting her to call off the whole thing based on the message I sent.  I wanted her to say, no it's fine come anyway.

I feel so bad because I really like her as a person and I know how much she must be hurting right now.  If I feel like absolute shit, it must be ten times worse for her.  I have never felt anything like this before honestly.  That also makes me wonder ? it seems like I must have feelings for her!  It has literally taken everything in me to not text her today.  I really do want to see her.  I wish I could get over this anxiety and just fucking understand my feelings.  Is it a bad idea to text her?  If I text her and tell her I want to restart things, I think she would do it, but the problem is I am not sure if that is what I want!  Some of her behavior was kind of alarming, like freaking out about my business meeting on sunday even though I was already taking a full night off and driving an hour just to see her.  Now if I try to get her back and then don't end up wanting a relationship, I'll hurt both of us even more than I already have.  I know for a fact she wants a relationship, but I just don't think I want to start an exclusive relationship right before I leave for abroad, and also I'm having such a hard time deciding if I like her or not especially given that I haven't seen her in two months! I just wish she had waited literally one day to do this, because I really wanted to see her again to figure everything out.

I just need someone to give me advice on what to do next because I'm completely lost.  Do I text her and try to restart things?  Or do I get over it and try to learn from this situation for next time, because I think if I really wanted to be in a relationship with her I would know.  Like I have had plenty of crushes on girls and I know what that feels like, and I don't think this is it.  However, I obviously care about her due to my feelings today: I actually cried at one point.  I'm just overwhelmed and have never dealt with any of this before.  I just wish I could see her in person, but I already wasted her mom's money by not going to the hotel room she bought so at this point if I was going to try to get back with her, it would have to really be a solid effort, not just some wishy-washy ""let's see how it goes"" thing.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 10 years. I don?t want to go into too much detail but I?d say our relationship is rock-solid, or that?s what I thought.

Last year we went from living in the same city to long distance. We both cried when we said goodbye but we talked and texted every day and we made plans to reunite a couple months later.

When we finally reunited everything seemed great but I noticed something was off during sex. He couldn?t keep his hands off me, he was the one to initiate, but then he couldn?t stay hard. Please don?t get me wrong, I know this is normal but it caught me off guard because in all the time we?ve been together this has never happened before so it was completely unexpected.

I didn?t give it much thought at first, but it kept happening every single time we tried having sex in all those days we spent together. I was confused and sad, I felt like I was doing something wrong or I wasn?t attractive anymore. I tried talking to him but he wouldn?t say much. I know this can be a sensitive subject for guys so I didn?t mention it again.

Just a couple days ago we moved to the same city so no more long distance. Once again everything seemed great, he was excited to see me, I was excited to see him? but then the story repeats itself. Every time we try having sex he won?t stay hard. 

And this is when things get really weird. Today I asked him if I could use his phone to send some pictures to myself and he said sure. That?s how I found hentai/cartoon porn on my boyfriend?s phone. I?m ok with my boyfriend watching porn but those pictures were truly disturbing and something I never expected from him. It made me feel like I don't even know him.

I guess what really bothers me is I found those pictures on a texting app folder, which means either someone sent him those pictures or he was the one sending them. He is in a role-playing community (D&D kind of stuff) so I thought maybe they were using those pictures for their role-play in some weird way. He had received some pictures today so I looked through his recent conversations (I know that was wrong and I feel terrible for it and ashamed of myself, believe me) but I couldn?t find anything. I?m pretty sure he deleted whatever conversation those pictures came from.

This got me thinking and I?ve noticed this past few days we?ve been together that sometimes he will turn slightly around when using his phone so I don?t see who he is texting. I?ve also noticed he is paying more attention than ever before to his phone. But then again he is not secretive about his phone, he lets me use it without a problem and he is still loving and caring towards me so I don?t know what to make of all of this. I also believe those pictures and whatever is going on might be related to our bedroom problems.

I plan on talking to him about all my concerns but first I want to calm down and think this through and I?d appreciate some unbiased and logical advice. How would you approach this? Do you think I?m in the wrong here? Am I being overly paranoid?

- First love / husband I will refer to as DH (M/24)
- internet love i will refer as IL (M/24)
- I?m 23 and female
- English is not my first language so sorry in advance


Soo my story begins with in 2012 with 16 year old mee crazyyy falling in love for the very first time. It was crazy and all-consuming. I saw him, looked him in the eyes and just knew in my deepest heart that I will someday marry this boy before even knowing his name or anything who he is. 

So in my culture there is no such thing as boyfriend girlfriend, if you are seen out in public together you?re basically engaged. So we did everything we could to hide our relationship. We had a long-distance relationship after the first 6 months and I would say it became rough after that- because it always was. But thats another thing. 

So what had to happened, happened and we were seen together after about a year and a half into this relationship and everything was prepared for us to be engaged. I was THRILLED. NO HIDING ANYMORE. He on the other side not so much. He always said ?I?m not getting engaged at 18?. 
So, of course I know now, that he was the only rational thinking human out of all of us. But still.. 

Ok so I?ll keep this next part short because this was the worst time in my life. 
He left me. No explanation. No real goodbye. He literally just texted me ?I leave you? and blocked me everywhere. I fell deep into depression, gained 15 kg and cried myself to sleep every night. It was almost to the day 9 months after he left when I went to sleep and realized in the next day that it was the first night without crying myself to absolut dehydration. 

So after that I tried to socialize a little because I felt so incredibly lonely. So thats when I ?met? IL. (Late 2014) he lived 700 km away and was an incredible person. Very easy going, very funny. Just someone you love to know. We flirted a bit but I never was ready for more. For me it was crystal clear that I would never be able to love anyone again. 

So me and IL fought about something silly and we lost touch for a year or so before I texted him again. It was like no time had passed at all and we started talking about meeting. But I never knew where I am at with him. Was he into me? Would he consider a relationship with me ? I just felt stupid to ask and honestly I kinda waited for him to say something. 

Then my mom got sick, and I for the second time in my life lost every ground I had under my feet. I felt soo lost. He was there for me. He made me laugh when all I wanted to do was crying my heart out because I strangely even somehow missed crying after it became such a big part of my life during that black time. 

We made plans to meet up when my mom would finish her last chemo. But then something happened what I would have never expected in my life. 

DH came back. Just as unexpected as he left he came back. After fucking 4 years. I never forgot about him, but in the last months I catched myself thinking about a life with IL. IL and me had something so good even if we never talked about what we really were but unfortunately he never stood a chance. How could I not accept DH back in my life after crying and praying for years that he would come back to me. 

You?ll hate me for the next part. I texted IL that I was sorry but I just had to explore things with DH because I could never forgive myself if I didn?t. He was very disappointed but said go ahead. 
Me and DH moved in together after a month, married after 6 months after getting in touch first after this time. He saw no point in waiting. 

So. Yes I?m happy. I love my husband. I love that we got together and somehow now even appreciate him leaving me because I had 4 years on my own, to get to know myself, to know who I am and who I want to be. 

But the thing is I still think about IL A LOT. I wonder if he is okay. If he thinks about me. I wonder what my life could have been if we just had met one time before DH came back. Maybe be wouldn?t just be that stranger from the internet. Maybe we would have clicked the moment we met. Maybe he was supposed to be my great love. 

But these are all just maybes. Another maybe is that maybe nothing would have happened at all. We would have seen each other and just feel like friends. 

I know I made a mistake because of exploring things with DH I should have insisted on meeting IL first. Because everything would have been resolved by then. I just couldn?t turn down DH after praying so long to God that he comes back to me. 

So tell me. Is this normal? Is it just reminiscing or is this more? I just don?t know what to think about it.

I graduated from well-known college near my home town about a month ago. I was a commuter student and graduated a year early, so the only time where I wasn't completely living at home was my last semester which I compromised for with some other things. It was only in the last year of college where I really started making friends and having more kickbacks, and just doing more things in general. For context, I went to my first concert back in October and was allowed to go to another state for a weekend with my friends with just us. Even then, my parents liked doing random drop-ins to my apartment or when I was walking back home from class at around 8-9 pm, which honestly annoyed me because I had specifically requested they only come when I ask them to. 

I've recently moved back into my parents' house and I feel like there are two problems. First is more related to lifelong academic/career goals. I have always been someone who has been very practical in the lifelong decisions I make - I acknowledge that going to a good college, graduating early, and graduating debt-free are all amazing things, but I really regret not being able to have some more fun and time to explore non-academic interests and have more of a social life. So while my original plan was to take the LSAT, apply to law school this upcoming cycle, and then go back to school, I've been doubting if this is the route for me to take. If I get some work experience under my belt, I might have some more time to explore other interests rather than just go back to school. On the other hand, going to school may provide me the opportunity to move away from my hometown. My parents want me to do all of this all together. They want me to go with my original plan and apply to law school and then work in the year before while I wait for decisions to come in, and then want me to most likely stay in the same state if not just continue commuting from home. My parents also keep dropping hints they want me to use my savings/potential earnings to put a down payment for a house so they can rent it out and it'll basically end up with me having ""income"" to pay off student loans and the mortgage on the house.

The problem is I feel like I can't handle all of that and when I confront them they always say they haven't said I *have* to do what they say because they haven't directly told me to. I also am honestly sick and tired of not really having as much of a social circle as I'd like to because most of my friends from high school and college have moved away, and I don't really have anyone my age to really talk to. The other thing is that my mom very specifically wants me to go to law school as soon as possible so I can find a boyfriend, which is something I want to do, but it's not a primary reason for me to apply and go right now. Plus, I'm open to using dating apps once I feel a little more settled into whether I decide law school vs. work experience, but it was pretty frustrating to hear that. I'm not going to law school to become a wife, I'm going to law school to become a lawyer.

Second problem is that I've always been a great example for a goody-two shoes kid, and really the only bad thing I do is drink. My parents know I drink outside of the house and they know I drink only with people I trust and only at kickbacks. I recently went out with a group of friends from high school on a random weeknight because it was the only night where we could all meet, and I don't know when I'll next see at least two of them. We knew that we would be drinking, except I did not tell my parents, and I acknowledge that this was my fault and I should have told them. I ended up drinking 3 shots of vodka, which later my parents saw as completely unacceptable and too much to drink. I did tell them we would be out late so my mother put my sister (>18F) in charge of staying up and making sure I'm home. There was no curfew, but my father ended up texting at 3 am to know where I was. I had fallen asleep in the car because we had to drop a few people back home instead of them taking public transit, so my friend messaged my sister who told my dad I was fine. I got home at around 4:30 am.

The next morning I had a hangover and was recovering, but was still helping around the house in terms of cleaning, and worked on some stuff I had to do. Since that time however, my dad had been very passive aggressive about the fact that I did not tell them what was happening and that I was making a bad decision. My mom did not say anything. My dad also yelled at my sister for not telling him what was going on and the fact that my friend messaged my sister.

This continued for a few days until today it completely devolved into a full blown emotional discussion regarding my boundaries and decisions. I kept trying to say that I make a lot of good decisions, and even the bad ones I make are ones which I do with people I trust. My friend who was driving did not drink anything the entire night, as did another friend. We also were careful with regards to underage drinking and getting caught, which my mom says was her biggest problem, in addition to the fact that there are other dangerous drivers out there. I tried to tell them that this was my decision, albeit a bad one that I acknowledge, but it was a decision I wanted to make even after evaluating the risk. This was not the first time I had drank nor the first time I had been out this late with these specific friends who my parents know and who I have known for the past 5 years. We also talked about my idea of ""fun"" and I said that drinking is not my only idea of fun but it is one of them.

My parents and I then agreed to disagree that I can make all the bad decisions I want because in the end it is my life, and I need to learn to be more independent. For the independence thing I tried to say how bad decisions are a part of that and I make wise decisions for myself a lot as well. I acknowledge that while I am under their house I do need to follow their rules, and I broke a few last night, but being passive aggressive or just aggressive about the decisions I make just makes me feel really bad. Then my dad said to me in a raised voice how he sees the fact that I drink so much as a bad decision, and that he's fearful that I won't have kids, and that if I continue to drink like this then any South Asian husband will kick me out and that he's responsible for me until I get married. I snapped at this and told him that my one night of drinking does not mean that everything else I've done is negated. I didn't say this, but I also think that anyone I marry would be someone with similar values to me. My mom diffused the situation with my dad and I walked away. It basically ended at I know the decisions I make, but my parents will continue to impose themselves on me and I have to tell them stuff.

I honestly am at my wit's end and feel like I'm going crazy because I'm already dealing with self-imposed pressure on trying to figure out the next step in my career, while also trying to create the best life I can for myself. I started working out this past year, and have lost close to 16 pounds, which I'm very proud of. I have a list of books I want to read, and I want to learn new forms of dance. I just want to be able to live life. I think I'm still a good kid at home, I do house work like cleaning and I try to spend as much time as I can with my family. I care deeply about my parents, but I feel like they need to respect my boundaries and my decisions, regardless of what I do.

I've [39 F] been struggling lately with an almost existential crisis. Trying to figure out who I am and why I keep struggling with depression and feelings of incompleteness and inadequacy.

I have an amazing husband [37 M] who supports me in every way. He's caring and sweet and complimentary and treats me so well I can't imagine life without him. He is the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life and I will do anything to keep it that way. That's why I'm struggling so much with figuring myself out. I have everything, a beautiful family, a nice house, a great career, but I still feel like I'm missing something.

It's taken a couple of years to figure out that it's sex, at least related to sex and secual attraction. My husband is very attractive, handsome and masculine, I'm very attracted to him,we have a good sex life. However, I'm finding myself increasingly attracted to females recently.

This feeling underneath, this excitement about another woman is making me question so much. I don't know what to do now. My husband would be fine with bringing another woman in our bed, we've spoken about it before, but that makes me panic. I don't know anything but monogamy, I can't imagine anything without him, or feeling this connected to anyone but him. I am 100% in love with my husband, but this hole feels so empty. I'm experiencing more frequent spells of depression and anxiety just completely stressing this.

What do I do? How do I face this? Am I just confused or trying to find answers by glomming onto unassociated feelings? I am so overwhelmed.

**TLDR; Agreed to break-up and move out of BF's apartment due to his anxiety, depression, and work stress (according to him). Asked if we could try and work on the relationship after agreed break-up, and he said he doesn't want to decide until I move-out. Not sure if i'm just beating a dead horse.**

&#x200B;

Yes, it was a dumb choice, but 10 months ago I ended up being convinced by my BF to moving into his apartment 2 months after we got into relationship with each other. Well as you can expect, I'm currently surrounded by packed boxes of my stuff that are getting moved out tomorrow.

Here's how things went south-

About 3 months in to moving-in, I noticed that sex gradually decreased, his interest in engaging conversations with me went down, and displays of affection went away almost completely. It felt like my presence and desires of being affectionate was a constant a nuisance for him. He would also spend a lot more time alone outside the apartment and would use excuses like he's just running to the bodega and would end up being out for 3 hours in the middle of the night. Despite the fact that he could and used to work from home more often, even on weekends and outside of his typical office hours, he insisted that he just wasn't productive working at the apartment when I was home. Even how he treated me started becoming more aggressive and heated. He started calling me hurtful names and getting angry with me more often over little things.

On a side note, he's mentioned to me he was diagnosed on the autistic spectrum as a kid. He's closer to the mild/high-functioning side. Even though he's never used autism as an excuse, I could see how this aspect of him affects how harsh and aggressive he can get and how it's sometimes difficult for him to sympathize with me when he notices I'm upset. However this, couldn't explain the fact that his behavior changed so much from the time we started dating. He was super attentive, even criticized me for being the colder and less affectionate one between us, and was super-easy going. He used to make me feel so secure about our relationship and allowed me to open-up more than I ever had in my prior relationships. Now I just feel completely unwanted. As things progressively got worse, it was clear something wasn't going right. Every time I brought up the issue, he would insist he was just busy and these were problems I fabricated which needed to be dealt with on my own.

Turns out after several conversations/arguments, the explanation to the behavior change was due his episodes of anxiety attacks coming back after 3 years. He had already told me when we first started dating that in his early 20's he started developing major anxiety attacks which were pretty serious, but went away in his late 20's. He would suffer episodes of anxiety attacks multiple times a day for several months at a time. In the beginning of the relationship, I had seen him experience a few minor ones, but they didn't seem to affect him as much. They started becoming more frequent since then. Since he's learned to deal with them so well, I didn't take it as something that could have correlated with why he seemed no longer interested in me. Perhaps that was ignorant on my part, but anyone looking at him wouldn't be able to tell he had any issues. He's currently has to take meds to avoid them. In addition to his anxiety affecting him and our relationship, there has been a significant increased stress in his career. His actual free time has greatly decreased, so when there is a moment for him to decompress, he tends to rather spend it on his own.

By the time the fights started occurring more often, we decided to drop the relationship, he ended up telling me how it should have been obvious he was falling into depression as a result of the anxiety and the work-stress, so I should have been more understanding instead of making the issue about myself. The hardest part in coping with that fact is that he was never susceptible to telling me these things prior. Every time I brought the issue, he would get defensive and put the blame on me being too needy. Shortly after the break-up decision, he admitted that he was different when I met him and he had the capacity to be more present with me before. However, now that the anxiety, depression, and job-stress had taken over, he was over his limit in being able to take on my own needs as a partner. He pointed out that it was unfair for me to deal with his own issues for the sake of my own happiness, and that it would only make things worse for him knowing he's disappointing another person. He still loves me but feels that the relationship just isn't healthy to continue as is. This was something I wished I could have known prior to the break-up so we could have worked on it together. For me, it just constantly felt like he was no longer attracted/interested in me and simply got bored.

So here's the hard part- we were still stuck living with each other for 2 1/2 months up while I have been struggling to find a new place up till now ( like I said, I officially move out tomorrow). I also caved about 2 weeks into the initial break-up and asked if we could still try and work on the relationship. Maybe it's dumb, but I still really love him. After I made this clear to him, he's explained he doesn't want to make a decision until after the move-out date. So for the 2 months of us just being unclear with where we stood, it's been a rollercoaster ride of emotions. It's also clear I took the break-up harder than him, and the worst part is that I can't help but feel like he may only be stringing me along about the possibility of trying the relationship again just to keep some sort of peace while we have been living together. My fear is that he'll simply cut me off once I'm moved-out without any proper closure or communication. I've brought this up based on how he just shows no signs of being interested in working on our relationship and doesn't display any signs of attraction to me. I've assured him that if he's just not interested, I rather him be clear and upfront for my own peace of mind, but he insists he just wants to wait things out, and that he doesn't plan on cutting me out.

I guess what I'm looking for is some clarity on the matter. I can't tell if i'm just letting myself cling to a bad relationship or if there truly is something there that can be worked on.",1561851514.0,I'm (25F) moving out of my BF's (30M) apartment and don't know where to go from here,0.64

It happened the other night and last week but we had plans to just hang out (nothing serious she just works later and my weekend had started so we were just gonna watch movies and chill). She texts me when she?s about to leave so I can meet up at her house. However both these times that didn?t happen until an hour after. The first time she let me know that she was saying bye to everyone and got caught up. The second I hadn?t left yet but I was giving her some extra time to get settled

Both nights she?s been weird. The first time I met her just as she was getting home and she tasted like booze. She went to brush her teeth like twice through the night. I thought maybe she just had a shot and was being weird but when we tried to have sex it was clear she was kinda fucked up.

This week she greets me at her door and she had brushed her teeth to cover up the smell again. Things basically go the same as the last time. I ask if she?s ok because she seems off and she said ?yeah I?m ok? and then ?actually yeah I?m a little off? and she said we?d talk about it in the morning. Fast forward to that morning and I try to bring it up and she brushes it off and says we?ll talk about it later.

I don?t really know why she?s acting like this. We?ve drank together and she?s done coke around me (I don?t anymore). It?s clear she?s fucked up and coked up. I was kind of annoyed but not really bothered until she basically tried to hide it from me. She?s definitely not cheating because she?s texting me the entire time she?s doing this.

I?m kind of annoyed because I?m rolling up to her house sober expecting to hang out and have quality time with someone who I don?t get to have a ton of that with. Each was supposed to be a chill night but she comes back home fucked up and the fucked up version of her is an entirely different person.

I have been in a relationship for quite a while now >4 years. But recently my gf moved away, we did LDR throughout college, but just the summer months. Recently it's been a bit more long term - which I didn't mind. Busy with work - see her every few months etc.

She likes me, and I've made it perfectly clear that I'll never cheat. But we have been talking a lot, arguing about why I'm talking to her, tears etc.

He and I get along very well and he is a very good man and partner, but we are having a bit of a disagreement over me driving for Uber.

I?m currently five months pregnant. I have a job in retail, and my bf has a really good job of his own working for the city, but we have a lot of things to pay for and some more income would make me feel better.

My boyfriend works very hard in his job and it doesn?t seem reasonable to me to expect him to work even more, so I thought I could start driving for Uber. I know it doesn?t necessarily make a ton of money, but I could do it as my schedule allows and it?s not very physically demanding and every dime I make at it will only help.

But my boyfriend is very uncomfortable with the idea. He is worried something will happen to me going around driving people. I point out that I grew up in Seattle, so I?ve been dealing with methheads since well before I knew him, and I can take care of myself.

He tells me he knows our new city (Kansas City) better than I do and he thinks I?m being naive in thinking I?ll be able to deal with trouble here.

He told me he wouldn?t stop me from doing it, but he is very clearly opposed to it, and I?d like to find agreement. And he did buy my current car for me, so I grant that he gets a little more say over it than I might give otherwise.

222,NotAnOrdinaryGirl,Non-Romantic,1,c765go,1,"So it?s a huge story but i will try to provide as many details as I can. 
The last year I?m studying abroad and my father paid my tuition and my monthly expenses. Although, the last couple of months he has huge mental problems and even the doctors are trying to leave him. He has done horrible things in the past e.g. cheating on mum for years with my aunt, treating to her like a garbage in front of her parents etc. One week ago, he called me and he told me to fuck off, that i am a trust ( this is a routine for me not something new) and i answered to him that I haven?t done anything wrong. He told me that is my fault that he broke up with my mum and that from now on he will never send me money again and he threw out of the house my 16 years old sister. I have to mention that my father has a fortune and that he lets my mother to work as cleaner in random houses even if she is sick ( back problems). So, now my mum and sis late trying to survive and i took a loan in order to cover my expenses.

All my life my issue was my father. He is so mean with everyone and we cant do anything. I m coming from a corrupted country and he has the money to pay the best lawyers. I m so jealous of the happy families. I have major issues of self- esteem and I?m extremely pessimistic. Any of my ex-boyfriends has ever met my family. Especially now i don?t even have a house back in my country or a place to stay ( my mum and sis live in a hole , a single room with 2 beds). I?m currently dating a guy in the country that i study that he is from a very good family not only in terms or wealth and prestige but also in terms of manners, Me from the other side i only have misery, a big carriage of mental issues and no family. I am so afraid that every guy or his family will thing that i am loser, not worthy or that I will end up like my father. Also, i feel so ashamed of the financial status of my mum right now. I?m trying to hard to find a job in this new country, write my dissertation and try not to think how f** up in my life.

224,RecentPainting,Relationships,37,c761is,0,"So last year my wife and I pretty much agreed to divorce. I moved out and it was a rough few months. This was all initiated by her because according to my wife, other than in sex and ambition, she doesn't feel connected to me. I guess that's fair, my wife is very passionate and loves art, music, sensual deep stuff. I get it but o funny care for it. She felt like she lacked something and wanted to find it.

Anyway, during this time he friend Jen was really there for me. Jen was my wife's best friend but oddly lost her closeness to Jen for very similar reasons. She accused Jen of becoming too much of a career oriented dull adult.

Jen and I inevitably hooked up and it was probably the best relationship I've ever had though we ended it after only 2 months. Why?

My wife wanted to give our relationship a second chance and two Jen was also sort of casually dating someone who seemed good for her.

I know we were both extremely jealous and it was hard for us to split up after having such a close intense affair but we both hardly showed it.

I only learned how hard it was for Jen from her friend.

Anyway, my wife and I after months of trying worked things out and we're quite happy today.

Now Jen and in rarely talk. Aside from sending me memes or nice pics on Instagram, we don't really communicate.

I've noticed though, Jen has been talking to my wife a lot. My wife hadn't even told me but I overheard my wife listening to a voice note from Jen and from the sound of it they've both been talking a fair amount. Jen and my wife as far as I know have barely talked in the last year or more.

Again I should reiterate, I never told my wife about Jen and I hooking up. I hate lying to her but my marriage was in the pits and if she knew we'd be divorced today. Though, not to be all Ross about it, but we were on a break.

I do suspect my wife was with other men during this time. She wanted to explore, she's very very attractive, has a high sex drive and has a ton of guy friends. I'd be legit surprised if she didn't.

I guess you're wondering why I haven't asked her or she ask me? Well I think we're both afraid and also, I lied initially saying I was alone and missing her (implying I want with any woman) and she said she was too.

Would I care knowing the truth? Of fucking course, especially if it's a guy she's still friends with, but I'm afraid of bringing it up and afraid of the fall out of she found out about Jen. So right now, I'm avoiding it.

But back to the main issue, I'm not at all comfortable with Jen being friends with my wife and I'm oddly jealous. Why ignore me for months, yet communicate so happily with my wife,?

Really why would she? Does she miss her friendship? Is she trying to mess with me? Is she trying to get close to my wife and then tell her the truth? I'm so confused and frustrated.

It also made my realize despite seeming fine for months, I do miss Jen :(

Can anyone shed some light on what could be her motivation?

225,lonelycalliope,Breakups,2,c75xg9,1,"Back in March, I (34F) was contacted by a guy (33M) who I had met through a mutual friend almost five years ago. At the time, I didn't think he was interested in dating me; as it turns out, he had just started dating someone else, and by the time he was single, he noticed from social media that I was in another relationship. He reached out in March to figure out whether I was interested in a date, as he didn't know whether I was single or not. By this point, we had both moved out of the city where we originally met, in opposite directions--we now live 1500 miles apart.?

That didn't stop him from pursuing me from afar, and expressing repeatedly how he realized that I might be the ""one who got away,"" but now he would make damn sure I didn't ""get away"" this time. We spoke every day over text or phone, and in the course of our conversations realized we not only had a lot of interests in common, but also shared common values and were looking for the same thing (namely, a serious relationship that eventually led to marriage and children). He was supportive and kind whenever I had a tough day, and sent little gifts out of the blue to make me smile. We were able to meet up over a weekend in May for a mutual friends wedding, and spent a fantastic few days together. Our chemistry--emotional and physical--is just as strong in person as it was over phone/text. We decided we would figure out how to visit each other despite the distance and our mutually busy work schedules (neither of us has a conventional 9-5 job, which means we both work weekends). I managed to visit him for a week in late June, where I met his mom and good friends, his colleagues (all of whom said they really liked me and how happy I made the guy), and otherwise enjoyed spending quality time with him and seeing what his hometown was like.

In the few days after I get back home, I sent him texts to the effect that I missed him and such. He responded but never addressed those particular texts directly, and I assumed that he wasn't deliberately ignoring them. This past Friday, he calls me on a morning I have off and starts talking about how he's looking at his schedule and he doesn't think he'll have much time to visit me and how unfair it is that I would be doing all the traveling. His tone had changed drastically, and I start to get wary and upset. I ask if this means he doesn't want to date me. He doesn't give me a direct answer, and in the course of continuing to talk things quickly go downhill. He says he wants to give me the kind of relationship I deserve, and doesn't know if he has the mental space to do that right now, and doesn't know when he'll be able to and doesn't want to leave me hanging. He says he still has the same strong feelings for me as he did before. He asks if we can perhaps be good friends instead for now. I get even more upset and need to end the call as I became incoherent while crying.?

His last text to me: ""you are an amazing woman and I would love to try and have a friendship at this time."" It seems really bizarre that he's had this sudden 180, going from adamantly pursuing me to requesting this tepid ""friendship"" status. Some background: he was severely abused by his father as a young child, which left him with both permanent physical injuries and emotional baggage. He is very close to his mother and she is a strong, supportive, loving presence, but he often expresses his self-doubts as reflections of things his father once told him: that he'd never amount to anything, that he's worthless, not worth loving, etc. As a result (I imagine), he's never had a relationship longer than 7 months, and has never told a partner that he loved her. The 7 month relationship ended when he discovered his then-girlfriend was cheating on him with her ex, and yet before finding this out--despite never having said the L word--he was apparently ready to propose to her.?

So, redditors, I need your advice. What to do now? This isn't your typical narcissistic boyfriend story; his personality and experience suggests he wasn't just in this for the chase and then lost interest when he finally ""got the girl."" Instead, I'm wondering if he's terrified of intimacy and commitment because of his past trauma. Unfortunately, he's never sought professional therapy since a childhood experience (namely, a horrible, incompetent and unethical therapist disclosing his reports of abuse to his father, leading to more severe abuse) made him wary of therapists. He knows he needs one now. I'm wary about staying friends because I know I want a relationship, and getting a watered-down ""friendship"" version from him won't be enough. He says that he may decide he's ready for a relationship, and if I'm still interested, he would consider himself lucky. But damn, that's what he said about me last time...he felt lucky that I was single this time around and that he'd make sure I didn't actually become the ""girl who got away."" Thoughts?

P.S. I should add that comments to the effect of ""you dodged a bullet and you'll find someone better"" haven't been very helpful, as I've already gotten that from friends. I'm not dead set on being this guy's soulmate/life partner, but everything feels very unresolved right now.

EDIT:  forgot to put we?ve been together 20 years.

She had her sister buy us the crib.  That seemed like too long of a title though!  

And actually we had discussed what to do about the kid?s beds.  But the conclusion to that discussion was that we were going to wait to buy anything.  I was leaning towards converting the crib/toddler bed we already have back to a crib when our newborn was too big for a cosleeper.  And then buy a big kid bed for my toddler who would have probably been 3 by then.  She?s huge, the size of a 4 year old already.  So we?d be getting that bed soon anyway.  

Even my wife doesn?t think we needed a new crib.  She said her main motivation to let her sister buy this is because her sister wanted to buy us something and she couldn?t think of anything else in her price point.  

That is a real sore spot for me, because this sister of hers has been nasty towards me for several years now.  I?ve pointed it out to my wife many times but I am left with the impression that although she thinks her behavior is wrong that ?it?s just the way she is?, and ?she can?t help herself.?  Yet when it comes to me I am on my own to deal with it, but she expects me to always be the bigger person.  Really it feels like she just doesn?t want to rock the boat and I should just deal with the personal consequences so she doesn?t have to go into uncomfortable territory with her narcissistic sister.  

But wait, there?s more.  Our marriage has been in a rough patch for several years.  Our main problem seems to be communication.  But that problem means conflicts don?t get resolved.  So they build up and fester.  

I want to go to MC to try to turn around the ship.  But it?s been put on the back burner until we have enough money in a few months.  Sometimes it seems like we shouldn?t wait.  Like when things like this come up.  We have been working on communication ourselves, but it?s still not working.  It seems like all our arguments boil down to ?I feel like you don?t love me, respect me, like me, trust me, nor attracted to me.?  Both of us feels like that.  So I guess we can empathize with each other.  We both also feel helpless and hopeless about fixing things.  

When there is so much wrong it?s hard to fit in new betrayals.  We were talking about the sister relationship triangle in general.  I brought up the crib thing and how I felt about it, and she just glossed over it without even acknowledging how I felt, let alone apologize.  It feels like she doesn?t care how I feel and she doesn?t think she did anything wrong.

That brings me to another point.  She has a slight issue with apologizing.  She needs to be right all the time and if she?s not she often has a big cry fest.  Usually her defense is defensiveness followed by black or white thinking if that doesn?t work.  It?s awkward to argue with someone who is nothing but defensive and if I don?t let it go as another argument unresolved, then eventually she blows up and either brings up a bunch of things from the past and shames me for being a bad person or starts with the ?I guess I just can?t ever do anything right, and You must think that I?m the worst person ever? line.

227,RocketMan8561,[new],2,c75s75,1,"I've \[M - 20\] been talking to this one girl \[F - 19\] for almost two years now. We started off as friends and sometime in the middle of all that I started kinda liking her. Around April last year, she told me she liked me back, which was great. However, due to conflicting life schedules (She left to study abroad for nine months), we were unable to date straight away.

&#x200B;

Throughout that time, we kept on talking and she reassured me time and time again, she was still interested in dating. She came back and yet again reassured me. We went on our first date back in early May. We went to the movies, and after that I walked her back home. As I dropped her off, she told me she had a great time and wanted to go out again.

&#x200B;

So, I waited a couple weeks, asked her out again and she told me she was busy and all around started acting a little bit more distant, told me to ask her again the next week. I did and the answer was the same. This has been going on week after week since. 

&#x200B;

She has told me on several ocasions that she's not doing it on purpose and doesn't want to lose me, that she just doesn't have time and so keeps on postponing. At first I was ok with it, but now, almost two months since it all started, it's starting to get ridiculous considering I've told her time and time again I can work around her schedule and she just keeps on pulling excuses and postponing. 

&#x200B;

My main fear is that this will continue to go on, who knows for how long, and that perhaps I'm wasting my time when I could be focusing on other things. Should I keep on waiting and see where it takes me, or perhaps just end it all now before it gets too far and feelings get hurt?

I found out that my gf cheated on her ex. I found out through a mutual friend and I did some digging. I found a message where she stated that she had just cheated on her BF and while she admitted to her friend in the text that she felt gross doing so and it was her first time, she then goes on to brag about the size of his junk. I confronted her on it and she denied it at first until I brought up the messages. She then told me that it was an old part of her life and it was a mistake that she regretted immediately. She told the guy to take her home half way through sex Cause she felt guilty. None of them finished. She assured me it was a one time mistake and she would never do that to me cause she loves me. She claims the guy she cheated on wasn?t even in to the relationship and she felt lonely because they never got to see one another and she was already planning on leaving him prior to when she did it. The thing is they were still together as far as he knew. She broke up with him later that same day. She was crying and begging me the whole time. We are still trying to make things work but now I feel insecure. Any guy she talks to now I can?t help but feel uncomfortable. Any time she so much as laughs from a joke another guy makes, sends me in to a spiral of thoughts. For reference all this happened recently (her cheating), this was 5 months ago. A little over 1 month before we got together. I?m so conflicted. I love her but I?m having trust issues and insecurities now. She lied to me because she had told me on many occasions that she never cheated in her life since she has been cheated on and knows how that felt. She even kept in touch with the guy she cheated with. They weren?t actively talking but were still FB friends. I can?t think straight

229,sparkle1920,[new],0,c75phc,2,"I talked to him about how he seems depressed. He had depression for a long time and was close to committing suicide. He says it?s not as bad as back then and that he?s fine. He says he just has some bad days. But that?s not true. I notice how he has changed. Just because he?s not thinking about killing himself that doesn?t mean that he?s not depressed on in need of therapy. Interacting with him drains me of my energy, it makes me feel helpless. And him rejecting going to therapy makes this feeling even worse.

&#x200B;

Whenever I ask him for a decision (like ?what do you want to do today/tomorrow/whenever??, ?you wanna go to this concert??, ?wanna go get lunch at xyz??) he?ll give me answers like: ?I don?t know/care? or ?let?s talk about it next time? but next time never happens. I get anxiety when I don?t have a schedule in my head for future events and he knows that. Still he keeps doing this.

&#x200B;

He does pretty much nothing at home when he visits me. See.. I get it. When I was living with my parents I never had to help my mom with chores. It?s great when you can simply kick back and relax because you know someone will do that boring and annoying stuff. But I get up at 5:20 am to go to work. When I come back I am exhausted. I open the door, my bf might shout a ?Hi there? while still staring at the computer screen. I can see he had some breakfast some hours ago as the dishes are still on his table right next to him. Empty bottles of water lay next to him on the ground. And the kitchen looks like he didn?t even try to clean up ? simply made food and ate it. I have two cats. He might leave stuff laying around that could be bad for them and they would eat it, because at least one of my beautiful feline roommates is fucking stupid and will get in any kind of trouble that he can find. He has nothing to do while he visits. He could use the time to clean up. But instead he uses his time to play games. (Don?t get me wrong: I love games and we play together a lot. But growing up means you need to learn that there are some times that you could do better stuff than playing games. And cleaning up is no big deal when you have a lot of time. Gotta get up to go the restroom? On the way there take your dishes with you. On your way back? Clean up the kitchen.)

&#x200B;

Besides that he?ll say one thing but do something else. He always says that he doesn?t want to use so much money as he is a student who makes no money while his parents pay for everything. I told him there are several options as side jobs where he could make some money. He doesn?t feel like working. When he started going to university he didn?t really care much about finishing it and so when you look at his resume you?ll see that he has been in university for a very, very long time. No side jobs. As far as I know this is not very attractive to most employers.

&#x200B;

My bf said I?d always be able to reach out to him. But he keeps turning his phone off or will put it in flight mode. He did this when we started dating because his former phone had a dead battery and would die in just a few hours on standby. But he?s got a brand new phone now and there is absolutely no need to do this anymore.

&#x200B;

I don?t feel like he desires me. There are moments when I will enter the room, wearing a sexy lingerie and all he?ll say is ?okay? I?ll turn off my computer?. Just to slowly follow me into the bedroom. It makes me feel like he sees sex with me as a chore. Our sex is good ? but I can?t enjoy it anymore. It?s always me who initiates sex. He says it?s because he doesn?t want to pressure/bother me about it. But it feels SO bad to see him do this ?Oh well I guess we?re gonna do this now? thing?

&#x200B;

Some months ago he started saying stuff like ?I wanna be done with university so I can be with you?. And yeah, that does sound nice. But I don?t want him to feel like that. I want that he finishes university because he has a passion for the job he?s about to get when he is done with studying. He?s said some stuff like that to different topics and it gets me anxious. I don?t want him to do this for me/us. I want him to do this for himself and his own future. I want a partner that can live without me but chooses to be with me. Not a partner that feels like he does everything in life for me. This puts so much pressure on me. When we met he wasn?t like that. He was passionate about what he?d do when he?s done with studying. I miss that part of him.

&#x200B;

Yesterday he told me that he?s thinking about switching to a different university close to me. I am panicking. Right now I don?t even know if I still want to be with him. And he is thinking about moving here. Am I expecting too much of him? Or are my views reasonable? I know I can only state my own view of things, maybe he has his reasons why he acts the way he does?

 If you think someone in your life is super cheesy, Adam will give them a run for their money. Since day one, Adam has been smothering me with comments about how beautiful I am and how much he loves me and giving me a list of places he wants to kiss me (geographic locations, not places on my body :) ). It is so much worse than it sounds. I would copy paste the text messages but Adam?s friends use reddit so I can?t.  I thought it was sweet at first, but it got old real fast. I figured that maybe Adam was just doing this because he thought that this is what girls want, but I have come to learn that it is his personality and he is proud of it. He is also very apathetic about social issues because they don?t affect him directly and that is a huge turnoff for me, even just for a high school relationship. And lastly, as I much I hate to say it, I am just not in love with him anymore. Going on dates feels like a chore and I find myself waiting to get home. I feel like the shittiest person alive for this because I?m lying to him. 

The thing is, Adam thinks I?m his soulmate. He has talked about us moving in together after high school, getting married, and even told me he?d like for us to be together when we?re in our 50s. I don?t want to break his heart when he realizes those things will never happen. He also didn?t ?do anything? , so it?s not like I can reference a specific incident, like I?ve done in past relationships. He?s still a nice person and I?d love to be friends with him eventually, but I cannot be with him romantically. I?m sorry if I worded this badly, I?ll clear up stuff in the comments if anyone asks. So how can I break up with him nicely ?

But here?s my confusion, she is a bad drunk, gets super horny and touchy when she is drunk, last night they were drinking with each other. It started around 2am, and I got a message that she was going to bed around 5:45am.

I recently inherited a home out of state from where we currently live. We decided to move there as the house is paid off, and cost of living is very low. Low enough that I can support him on my income alone while he goes back to school which he has wanted to do for a long time in order to have a career change (he is currently stuck in retail hell, I work remotely)

We found a program for the career he wants to get into near our future house, he quit his job, we packed up everything, rented a truck and are literally ready to leave. We were planning on driving out TOMORROW.

His family threw a little bbq today and we went over there to say our goodbyes. My bf failed to mention to me that he had been LYING to his entire family about our move. He told them all that he got a transfer with his company and would still be working full time. I accidentally let the cat out of the bag. He then wanted to leave early.

I don't understand why he did this. We tried talking about it and he just told me that he didnt want them to pressure him not to move. That was his only explanation.

I am pretty upset about this. 1.) He is now a proven LIAR. How do I trust that he isnt lying to me if he can lie to his own mother!?! (His family dynamic is a good one.) 2.) If he was so scared that he could be talked out of moving, it seems to me he isnt as serious about our relationship as he has indicated.

Anyone have  a positive outcome from taking a break and getting some space?

Sorry it?s kinda long. 


My  BF (30 M) and I (29 F) are going through something right now. We have been together for 6 months. I feel we moved a little fast. My lease was up in my place and he suggested I stay with him during the summer. We were so great that I said yes. Well, as soon as I got all moved in that?s when the problems began.  I knew he was messy but...I didn?t realize how messy. In addition, he refuses to clean up after himself or fold his own clothes. I didn?t mind buying groceries, cooking, and cleaning shared spaces and contributing in other various ways. But I think one should be able to clean up after themselves to some degree. He says , ?folding my clothes psychologically hurts me. I hate it. And I am not going to do it.. Every woman before you had just done it because typically women like to clean and they were my girlfriend. If you?re not going to do it then it just won?t get done.? Wtf? Something about that mindset turns me all the way off. 


He thinks I should have sex with him even at times when I don?t want to. Sometimes I just not in the mood. To be fair though, that is very rare. But he will walk out of the bedroom and sleep on the couch when he doesn?t get sex. He calls me selfish when i do this. Once again, the occurrence that I dont want sex is rare. Usually right before my time of the month.  We got in HUGE fight about these things and others that ended up being physical on his part, which he regrets and has agreed to get counseling for. I?m staying with my parents after that. 

I?m not sure if it can go back to the way things were after some space.  Before I moved in things were GREAT. We were totally in sync, but now I just don?t know.

We both go to school so they?re supportive in us staying here. We help them out a lot.

just sometimes, I?m the one who compliments him first, holds his hand first, stuff like that. 

Today I wore a dress for the first time in front of him and i just became distraught later because he never really said anything about it or even when he helped me take it off to take a nap together but I?m just kind of losing some steam here.

She used to babysit me when I was younger. I have shared with her some of the best memories of my childhood. She would take care of me whenever I visited my distant family. When I was having problems she supported me through them. She invited me to her house and just... She was just there whenever I needed someone, some help, an ear, a friend. She made the life of everyone's she has met better in one way or another. I can't stress how much of a good... no amazing person she is.

She didn't want to burden me, and I'm sure she wasn't ready to face her diagnosis, so she asked my mom not to tell me about her condition.

Actualy I have spent at least 4 nights crying like a hysteric over this. Whenever someone brings up the subject Icry like a baby.

With time more people have found out. My cousin doesn't suspect that I know, so I haven't called her to check on her. I know that Iam a monster. I don't know what to say. And to be honest Iam glad she asked my mom not to tell me, because I wouldn't know what to tell her.

I can't even provide words of support for this sweet person. Honestly, if I could get sick instead of her I would take this option, just to spare her from going through the pain.

Thank god her cancer was caught early and isn't agressive, so she will finish her chimo treatment in a few months. She won't be in pain much longer.

My husband and I had a spare room so her moving in made sense. We own our home and her rent is INCREDIBLY cheap. 

Lately she (we'll call her W) has been acting like a fucking loon. She broke up with her ex (we'll call him B) a month or so ago. Then she started hanging out with an old friend of hers who has been in and out of jail for meth. I was not enthused or impressed. 

My husband talked to her 3 weeks ago about her moving out. (She's ben sort of looking for a place for at least a couple of months now.) We thought it went pretty well. She said she hasn't found anything affordable, but she would start looking harder. 

Last week I was home alone when some tweaker came to our house looking for her pal. I was incredibly uncomfortable. So I talked to her about that.  It seemingly went well. She had already talked to the dude because she was also not happy about it. It was a huge relief to me how well it went to be honest. It felt like it was an adult conversation which don't always happen with her. 

A couple of days ago B started coming around again. That made me pretty happy. He's a cool guy sends he's good for her because he knows when to disengage from her. He basically lived here for a year, so last night he hung out with my husband and I for MAYBE 10 minutes. She was pissed. Told him that we're kicking her out and who knows what other nonsense. 

This morning I got home from work (8:30 a.m.) my mom, dad, and brother are all here and she is chasing B out into the yard SCREAMING at him. She went back in the house and he tells me that she's been smacking the shit out of him. His whole upper arms were red. She tried to trap him in her room so he couldn't leave. Like psycho shit. So then she comes back out and is flipping out that he's stealing her stuff because he put something in his pocket. He brings up that she's got his tv. Arguing ensues. He says he's not going back in our house to get it and she insists he needs to. He says he will if I walk upstairs with him. By this point I'm already walking back to the house cause I don't need this crap. Then she said something about me, my mom sort of heard it, I didn't. 

B ""Why don't you say it loud enough everyone can hear?"" 

W ""I was talking TO YOU!""

B ""You sure weren't talking about me."" 

Whatever it was it was certainly derogatory. My mom and I left right after that and B was gone when we got back.

So last year after the post I (now 23 M) decided I didn't want to talk to my father (47 M). I was initially supposed to see him the following month, but opted not to. After asking a friend for some advice I decided not to talk to my father anymore. So for about a week I didn't, and it seemed to go fairly well. Then he rang one day (landline doesn't have caller ID) and completely threw me off. I was short with him, which he noticed and asked me if I was okay. I lied and said I was tired which he appeared to accept, although rather reluctantly. 

About ten minutes after I hung up, he called my mother (48 F) on her phone. He asked if there was anything wrong with me, and she explained (with my permission) that I was upset because of how he treated me during my childhood. He understood, and was apologetic for it. She also told him that I didn't want to speak to him, and that I would contact him when I was comfortable to. 

A few weeks later after no contact he rang me to apologise, and I ended up reestablishing contact with him. This continued for several months, and seemed to be going pretty well. Then he started having issues at home, and started being more distant - he'd make excuses to not have a long phone call, we'd go a few weeks to a month without any contact, that sort of thing. I realise this probably doesn't sound like much, but it was depressing not to talk to him for long periods of time.

Anyway, something happened which made me think ""he's never going to change"". He was apparently treating his girlfriend poorly, acting sullen around her and making her feel bad. This was how he used to treat me as a child, and I decided I was done. I didn't want someone like this in my life, and so I made the decision to go no-contact. I sent him an email explaining how he made me feel as a child, gave examples of things he'd done and told him I didn't want to talk to him again. It was not an easy thing to do, and part of me still wonders if I did the wrong thing. What doesn't help was his response - he was completely understanding and apologetic, and said he was still there for me if I changed my mind. I know this sounds odd, but if he'd sent me some sort of scathing reply it would have been a lot easier for me.

Hey reddit people,

I'm  now for 4 years together with my wife, married for two years. Since  then she became more and more controlling, telling me what to do and  what not, always blaming me for everything, even if I don't have  anything to do with the problem (When she was mad, she blamed that I  would've killed her grandfather, who lives on another continent and who  I've only seen twice).

She isolated me  from friends and family and because I let that happen, former friends  don't answer to me anymore. We are both students, so money is also an  issue. She doesn't have any income and expects me to work, which I do to  have something for living. But when I take a shift, she also gets mad.  We live in a 1 room apartment, which intensifies the tension between us,  since we can't really be for ourselves to calm down. We also talked  about separation, but since she broke up the contact to her family due  to bad experiences and the relationship isolated us, nobody of us has a  place to go.

We  fight now almost everyday and she abuses me emotionally and insults me  really nasty, and also threatens to destroy my stuff, so that I would  solve all her problems, which I am not able, if she resigns.

Now I don't know what to do, she also refused a therapy and because of our life situation, we are dependent from each other.

246,throowaawaay21,[new],7,c74mlv,6,"Some background: My GF and I love each other but I have been apprehensive of her situation for quite some time now. She suffers from chronic migraines and is perpetually in pain ranging from mild pain to crippling / day ending pain. This has affected her school and work life and from my point of view, totally dictates her life. Any failure in her life, (dropping classes, not doing homework, not showing up to work, basically any obligation) is because of her migraines. She does not personally take any responsibility for anything that occurs since I've met her and when I try to point this out, she shuts down and becomes irate and that I ?don?t understand? because I don?t live in ?perpetual pain?. As such, she has dropped 3 semesters in 2 years and has failed to keep a job for the entirety of our relationship.

I used to believe that it was reasonable but through many things, its become clear that she greatly overestimates just how sick she is. She is almost always ?sick?. Says she says she has a fever about once every other week, etc. She is allergic to an insane amount of things (many of which I have personally confirmed are completely factitious) and whenever I tell her, oh well you ate X because it was in Y, she plays it off, ?Oh maybe, I?m not. -- Well, I had a bad reaction before!, etc.? This combined with her inability to take responsibility for anything, made me really doubt how much pain she claims she?s in. This is also something others who don?t know her have commented on. Many of those who knew her thought she was a hypochondriac which is something she takes great offense to.

She also lies to me about various things. Such as her grades, insisting that she is doing 'well' when in reality she isn't passing a single one of her classes, I asked her to not inform my family that she came to visit me when I was out of town (my family is conservative and does not accept any level of bf/gf cohabitation before marriage) -- she told my sister, luckily she does not care (as I do not) but it was a breach of my trust, and a few other less important things.

Her family is a train wreck and honestly something I think contributes to her poor health condition (undue stress = worse migraines). Her dad apparently did some questionable things to the children. Her mother is a piece of work (leaves her to take care of the newborn and the other kids so she can have sex), spends her alimony money to buy random things instead of food for the family, doesn?t work, yells and screams at the children, is constantly gone, complains about everything, her house is unspeakably filthy (roaches, pee stains, the smell). Her parents encourage her to marry me because I have a lucrative job (>250k/yr) which also kinda scares me.

My family, my friends and basically everyone in my life told me that I should probably look elsewhere and that there were too many problems with her moving forward. This has been a huge point of contention for me and something I communicated to her because these people matter to me. I feel something is genuinely wrong if everyone says its a bad idea -- something I also told her because I feel I should be able to be completely transparent with my partner. This becomes relevant later.

All of these things aside, she is incredibly kind to me. Going out of her way to be nice to me (she is from a poor background and she spends a considerable amount of her money on thoughtful gifts for me), is patient, loving and aside from the previous, I am generally very happy with her. That said, these problems are completely life encompassing and something that caused me a lot of distress -- especially the broken trust. As such, I asked her to break up. She panicked and quite literally begged me to stay, saying no one else would love her because of her problems, etc etc. I reconsidered but these problems and how I felt about them never went away. Soon thereafter I told her I wanted to break up again. She reacted in the same way, and because I was breaking up with her for 'reasons out of her control', it made it really difficult for me to not cave when she would call hyperventilating and literally begging me to stay. We would get back together but a week or two later, I would end up in the same position. This happened like 2 more times before I eventually blocked her on my phone with the last break up. She used her siblings phone to text me, emailed me with different emails, etc. I read them all because while I knew I didn't want to be a part of the relationship any longer, I cared about her deeply. I?m not sure when during the 5-6 break ups we?ve had but she would also mention killing herself, that I was the only positive thing in her life (she hates her family), etc. etc. Eventually she settled with her being my friend and would drop hints of wanting to get back together and the like. This went on for a few weeks until she slowly stopped contact.

I was not blameless here. I made mistakes. I told her that I didn?t care for her, and that we were over, etc. etc. to push her away -- namely because she would not stop emotionally tormenting me with how miserable she was without me in her life so I figured I would try anything to help her move on. These things are obviously horrible to say to someone who is still in love with you and I regret saying these things.

Eventually, she gave me two weeks of space. I made a reddit post about the situation, had some long conversations with some friends and decided that I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and try to work through our problems. When I called her, she told me that she was ?over? me and that I was a ?bad person? and that I ?chose this?. She says that I let my family dictate the course of our relationship and that I never tried to ?change? for her. I apologized, wrote her long winded letter explaining that I was wrong to let family, friends, etc. influence (in part) my decision, that I was sorry for not trying harder and that I would like one more chance. She treated me rudely / uncaringly (basically the opposite of what I did when she was the one asking) -- something that still bugs me if I?m being honest. I know she has every right to do this but nonetheless, it was a kindness I granted her (being there for her emotionally even when we were ?broken up?), I don?t see why this couldn?t be reciprocated or faked at the very least. In the end, she ended up blocking me.

247,quietpandaa,Dating,3,c74mem,2,"Last winter I took a small group seminar at my college, and one of the guys (we'll call him Mark) was really nice and cute. We would walk back to campus from class together each week. He invited me to hang out and get dessert together twice, but unfortunately I was really deep into anorexia and made lame excuses.

I was in the hospital for my eating disorder over last summer, so we didn't talk. Then when I was back on campus in the fall, we ran into each other a couple of times walking around campus and flirted pretty openly. Mark ended up coming to my room one night and we talked and made out for a while. He said that he'd had a crush on me all of the past semester because I was really nice and funny. I was literally walking on air after that night because I never thought things could work out, and that someone who I liked could like me back.

After that we didn't get to see each other as exams came around and we were both really busy. We were talking over text one night and I mentioned I had a bad cold, and Mark offered to come over with some soup and a hug. I said no because I was embarrassed at how gross I looked, but immediately after I really regretted it.

Over winter break and the past spring semester we barely talked. I tried texting him and Snapchatting him one or two times, but Mark would either only reply once or not at all. I figured he'd lost interest and I tried to move on.

At the start of the summer I learned via mutual friends and social media that his grandfather had passed away. I reached out, saying that I knew we hadn't talked in a long time but if he needed anything I was there as a friend. Mark was really appreciative and we texted a few more times after that, but I was working on campus and he was at home and then abroad.

He also revealed that the reason he went ASAP from January to May is that he took the semester off and wasn't on his phone much. I know people take time off of school for all kinds of reasons, but I suspect it was mental health related. He's a comedian that makes a lot of mental health jokes, and when he ran for student body president it was on a mental health campaign. He's also posted jokes about having a therapist on Snapchat. Of course, if anyone understands mental health it's me, so if that's the case I don't blame him at all.

My problem is that I don't even know if I have a real chance, or if I'm just annoying Mark at this point. When we talk he's openly flirty (replying damnnn !! to a Snapchat of me and showing interest in coming to visit the dorm I'm in for the summer). But he rarely reaches out first. One of my friends said that he may be anxious or insecure and be afraid of messing things up, which is why he's waiting for me.

So should I try to send him a really clear message that I'm interested and care about him? Should I wait and hope that he texts me? Or am I just wasting my time? The problem is that he's a few states away for at least the rest of the summer, so without a concrete plan to visit we won't even have a chance to run into each other for a long time. I'm inexperienced at relationships (thanks, eating disorder) and really don't know what to do.

So she is not my sister by blood, but we grew up together. Long story short, her mom used to be married to my dad. She cheated and she got pregnant. My dad found out, they stayed together for a short while after my sister was born, until her mom just left them. My dad later married my mom, and I was born. So both of our parents are different. She does consider my mom and dad as her parents too though. 


So lately I started having these thoughts about her. Sexual thoughts. I guess I always knew it, but I started noticing just how pretty and awesome she is. We often go to the beach together and she?s wearing her bikini and she?s just... you know, gorgeous. I can?t stop staring at her. Sometimes I feel like she?s showing off to me, but I?m sure that?s not true lol. Or maybe it is? I don?t know. This thing just confuses me so much.

We have been in our current home for 5 years. There is a one family directly across the street who is always nice to our face, are PTA bigwigs so we interact there (and it?s friendly), and just always looking like they are fine with us. But they have never invited us to or into their home. When we first moved in, we would have them over for simple things and all seemed normal. Eventually, we just never got invited to things at their house so we just sort of put our efforts into making other friends. No big deal. We are adults. We had just moved to this area and they have been here for like 20 years. They likely had other friends. This is not strange to me, but this other issue is.

&#x200B;

They have a daughter the same age as ours (9) and who is our daughter?s friend. They are in the same grade in the same school, and even shared the same teacher a couple of times. We invite her over for birthday parties and even sleep overs. After school she will come over and on the weekends she will be at our house playing. She is nice enough and polite. So we don?t care.

&#x200B;

What we do find strange is that our kids have never been over to the other home. Like never, except to play in the front yard since they are across the street and they are just playing outside in general. Our kids don?t get invited to her birthday parties or other play dates (they have them cause we hear about them). But as far as going in the home or even just playing in the backyard, never. It?s very odd.

&#x200B;

I have never seen this. As a kid, my friends came over and I went over to there home. No one cared. Now as a parent I realize it was a give and take between the families. Kids played in one home while the parents got a breather to clean or make dinner and then they switched for the other parents to get stuff done. Plus, it was just fun doing different things at each home.

&#x200B;

Here though, with the neighbor girl, it?s always play time just at our house. Our kids have other friends who live a bit father away, but we do the whole play here/play there thing. If they lived across the street we wouldn?t even care if the kids went to and from all day.

&#x200B;

So we don?t know if we should just ask the other parents if our kid can come over there and play? Or maybe tell the neighbor girl if she wants to play then our kids have to go to her house since we need to get something done or some excuse like that? Or just never mind about it? I know our kids aren?t jerks because other families have them over all the time and never seem to say anything or care they are over. And our kids still get invited to parties all the time or play dates. This neighbor situation is just odd as hell since this was not how we were raised.

&#x200B;

tl:dr: Daughter's friend from across the street comes over to your house all the time, but our kids have never set foot in their home in the 5 years we have lived in the area. Weird or not?

She would always give me flirty signals and I am pretty sure she was attracted to me. 
We were texting for a month before I finally asked my crush out. I suggested a date, she offered to reschedule and we proceeded. Had a great first date. Broke the touch barrier. 

Two weeks later, we had our second date and I brought her home. Note that I had to ask her twice through text. She offered alternative timings of the day instead, but I couldn?t make it for those timings. I feel like asking twice was already a lot for me so this made feel uneasy. I swore not to ask a third time. Then she posted her schedule on her private Instagram complaining of her workload. I really felt that she was hinting to me that she wanted to go on another date. So I suggested a date replying to her post and she responded with excitement. I think my instinct was right here. I would have definitely walked off if this did not happen.  

Two weeks is also pretty long between dates so this felt questionable but nevertheless we agreed to meet. We kissed and went to second base (she said she was on her period). I developed serious feelings for her then. Everything seemed well and she seemed to enjoy herself. 

After that, she became really cold, and distanced herself from me gradually. Pretty much a slow fade. Our texts became shorter and shorter. Asked her out twice again but she said she was busy. This was when I decided to confess that I had feelings for her through text and that I would like to develop a relationship. I told her that I had a great time with her the past two dates and that I?d be disappointed if nothing happened out of this.  (Perhaps this was a mistake). She never really expressed or reciprocated her feelings for me but she did say that ?things will get there? and so I believed her. Maybe she wanted to take things slow. She was going for a week long trip and said she will meet after her trip. 

After her trip, she didn?t really get back to me. I decided not to ask her out as I had already initiated the first two dates. After 3 weeks of no contact, I decided to ask if things went too fast on the second date and i apologized if I said or did anything wrong. (She did say she was afraid of me on first impression and I think she might have an impression that I was using her for sex). I wanted to clear the air here. I added ?Do you wanna talk about that night? ?

She replied a one liner saying that ?it?s okay, don?t be sorry?.  She didn?t really open up her feelings towards me. That was where I decided to call it quits and put her in the friendzone. She agreed. At this point, my mind was all fuzzy. I knew her short replies meant that it was practically over but I felt that I still had a chance with her. We had such a good time on our dates, what went wrong? 

My stupid self couldn?t get over her and I sent a Long message saying that I actually didn?t wanna be friends and that she meant the world to me. She hasn?t replied. Obviously I?m dying to get answers as to what happened. Right now feeling like shit after this painful slow fade.

I?ll be sure to bump into her soon due to a school activity and I?m not sure how to deal with this.

252,emleigh77,[new],1,c74g69,1,"F39, M40 frequently traveled together during last 2 years, not officially dating.

History - 2 years ago I sold a house and used the money to pay off bills and travel. Male friend and I went on cruises, traveled out of state, attended concerts, and rented a beach house for a week. In general, costs were split, but not 50/50. I think I paid more, although I wasn't tracking it because I had money in the bank.

Fast forward to now - cushion of cash is gone and I have been cutting back in general to try to pay off new bills. As I had earned a certain number of points on previous cruises, I was given a ""free"" cruise, meaning the cost is only taxes, fees and gratuities. If I pay the cost of the cruise and he pays for flights and hotels, he will be paying approximately $500 more for this trip that I will. 

Is this taking advantage of him? Should we split costs equally or should we take into account how much the cruise would have cost without the points discount?

253,eevergreene,Non-Romantic,11,c74f62,44,"TL;DR: After my mom died in 2017, my dad broke emotionally and we had to essentially rebuild our relationship from scratch. My dad now has a new girlfriend [48F] and seems to constantly value her over me, does not communicate well, and is essentially making me dislike both him and her without that being his intention.


In order to try to keep this concise, this is going to just be a list of reasons as to why the title rings true.

*Alone time:* I am essentially alone at home for multiple hours a day, and get 1-2 days a week at most where my dad stays home with me. The most notable occurances of being left entirely alone with minimal notice are when he went to a town ~an hour away to watch her son play basketball. This was before I had met her. He didn't tell me what he was doing, I didn't know her name at this point, and he didn't communicate at all to me until he came home after I was alone for ~36 hours and I yelled at him. For his birthday, he told me he'd be staying in a hotel with her and would pop in the following day. He did, but on his birthday when I bought him gifts and expressed interest to do something with him, he left at noon and only came back for maybe 5-10 minutes the next day before spending another night in the hotel. I was alone for ~40-45 hours. Right now, I'm alone, and will be for at least another two hours.

*Lack of communication:* Recently, I texted my dad asking lightheartedly if he'd be home for dinner because I was hungry and wanted to know if I could eat the leftovers in the fridge. He didn't text me back for almost an hour, so I called him, a bit snappily, to say I had asked if he'd be home. He said no. 30 minutes later, he's home with his girlfriend and says he's making dinner, would I like some and seems snappy with me for having already eaten and not wanting to eat with him and his girlfriend. I promptly told my close friend and she told me I could stay at her house for a while, so we hung out instead. When he went to the other city to watch her son's basketball game, he never told me what he was doing until he got home, and also told me he'd be back in town at X time, and then didn't come home, so I called and he said he was at her house. Another time when I had a choir concert he texted me saying he was with her and would see me later tonight, implying he'd be coming to the concert I had later that evening. He didn't show up. When I called him, he was angry at me because he ""didn't know how important it was to me"" even though he had the time to go and watch her son play basketball in another city when my school is hardly 5 minutes away from the house and my concert is 2 hours long, instead of 36 hours away from home.

*Says one thing, does another:* He often leaves a lot of important details out of what he does and won't tell me what's going on so I never have the full picture and he uses it against me. I got mad at him for being out so late yesterday and he was like ""it was gf's birthday, I'm sorry"" and guilt trips me even though if I had just KNOWN I wouldn't be mad. He's told me multiple times he'll communicate with me more and let me know things but he hasn't done anything to attest to those claims. I leave to go to a camp tomorrow and he's constantly saying how he's gonna miss me and how weird it'll be to not have me around and then goes and spends his time with her. He invited her to dinner tonight, the last dinner I'm having with him for 6 weeks. I feel so worthless in his eyes. It's like I'm not worth his time if she isn't there too.

*Misc:*
- Drove my car without permission at 3am because he didn't have his because he took a cab back to the house. Didn't try calling a different cab to go somewhere. Took my keys from my bedroom while I was sleeping. Didn't tell me until I directly asked him.

- Is unemployed and borrowed money from me without telling me how much it was, and we had hardly discussed the borrowing money thing. Says time and time again he'll pay me back. I don't not believe him, but that was shitty.

- Today was the first time I've been to his gf's house, and they've been dating a few months. Also the first time I've met any of her kids.

254,Thrwaway5476,Personal issues,4,c74cuo,1,"Lately I have been wondering what is missing in my life and why sometimes I feel frustrated.

I don't have a good relationship with my parents and are not close to my family. I make friends easily because I am fairly sociable but when I move to a different place/job I usually don't keep in touch which means I don't have those typical long lasting friendships from childhood or high school. I don't know why this happens... I guess it's just life, people get busy and don't have time to meet other people.

Romantically, I never had a serious relationship and was a virgin until recently. I had two long LDRs and was really in love with my last ex because I trusted him and felt save with him but he broke that trust by abandoning me. After that breakup, I was depressed for months and became more aphatic I guess. It's very hard for me to feel attracted by someone (and this doesn't mean just physical traits, because I need more than that to feel attracted). I eventually had a brief romance with whom I lost my virginity but it didn't work out and ironically it ended in a way that reminded of the breakup with my ex.

Because of all of this, sometimes I feel like I am invisible and if I disappeared nobody would even notice it. On the other hand, I became so used to do things by myself that sometimes I have troubles accomodating others or asking for help. 

I suffer from depression but I don't feel suicidal. Lately I just feel like I am roaming around without any purpose, but I since I moved out of my parents house to a city, I started enjoying life more (things like going to the beach, trying new food, taking walks, visiting new places). Sometimes I just feel like I would want to have someone to share those things with, but when I start seeking (go to events, have tinder and okcupid) nothing happens because I just don't feel a click with anyone. 

Should I seek to have a relationship or should I just give up? If so what things should I use to be motivated in life and forget my frustrations?

When she told me this, I let her know that I thought it was a bad idea to go drinking with people she doesn't know in a city she's not familiar with.

I stressed that I didn't approve of it, and it made me uncomfortable, but I can't control her actions. She decided to go out anyway.

My [32m] mother ""Ashley"" [63f] was just punched and knocked down by her sister ""Karen"" [65f]. My mother hit her back with her cane...

The sister (Karen) has 2 adopted identical twin girls from Guatemala, ages 13. She's barely a mother to them and my mom (Ashley) does 80% of parenting. The sister (Karen) is also a big hoarder, you can barely walk in her house.

They live in a duplex together (2 houses connected by a shared wall).

My mom refuses to call the police because ""you don't call police on family"", and she would be upset if I called the police also.

I told them all it was a bad idea to adopt these girls since I knew she would be a bad mother, but I was only 20 at the time, so nobody listened to me. I think the girls would have a more stable life in Guatemala, although a poorer one.

261,momusername12234,[new],1,c73oxl,2,"Some background ... I had a dog when I used to live at home and my sister \[30F\] had that dog's brother as hers. When I moved out I left my dog at home because he had became so attached to my mom and my mom to him. Late last year, he suddenly started having seizures at 8 years old and after brain tumor diagnosis he passed away within a few months. My mom and I put him down together. I don't think I've ever seen my mom that upset since her dad passed away ten years ago. 

&#x200B;

Current situation is that my sister \[30F\] still lives at home with her dog. My mom always loved both dogs but obviously now that this one is the only one left, she's attached to him too. A month after my dog passed away, this one had seizures which again was traumatizing and all of us thought he was going to die as well. Turns out he only had a stroke and doesn't have brain tumor and is doing fine now but my mom doesn't want to leave him alone. My sister is pretty much home all day when my mom goes to work so it's not a problem usually but on occasion if we all as family (my sister, my mom, my dad and his partner) want to go out do something she says she can't come because of the dog ... ""Someone has to stay home"" she says. 

&#x200B;

It's my dad's partner's birthday and I'm throwing a party at my house. I've invited everyone. My sister said our mom said she's bringing the dog. I said no, while we love him and want him to come over, he can't. Reason is the dog actually HATES my dad (and most if not all men, my partner is an exception). He doesn't stop aggressively barking and trying to bite. At one point he bit my dad's partner as my mom handles him too gently and doesn't discipline him. Our house has a lot of rooms so one could say technically you can leave him in one room and have your party. If we do that he whines and cries constantly very loudly. Plus my house is about 40 min drive from my mom and he is very anxious in the car and again barks and screams the whole time. 

&#x200B;

I've said no also because I want my dad's partner to have a relaxing day. It's hosted at my house mostly because I didn't want him to have to do anything, just drive here and have fun and relax. I told my mom this and she says well she doesn't come. This makes me upset because I feel like I'm being mean or unwelcoming and I'm the reason she's not coming. Plus my dad's partner wants my mom there and I'm sure he'd be wondering why my mom didn't come.

Is there any compromise here? the dog is also anxious at our house a bit as he hasn't been here a lot so he doesn't consider it his ""home"".

262,lac425,Non-Romantic,51,c73odv,37,"**TL;DR:** My dad has been making hurtful comments about my weight and refuses to stop. What do I say to him? How do I stop feeling hurt because of what he is saying?



My dad started harassing me about my weight when I was 16. I was 5'7"" and 136 lbs, so I was not overweight. However, he would tell me that I needed to lose weight and would constantly try to police what I ate. I learned to hide and eat in secret. I got up to 156 lbs in college and my dad's constant nagging about my weight intensified. Every time I spoke to him he asked me if I was exercising and trying to lose weight. He encouraged me to skip meals. I once lost 14 lbs in 3 weeks and he said, ""Good. Go lose 20 more."" I avoid being photographed because he once looked at a photo of me and said that I looked ""awful."" He'll walk past me and say that I have ""turned into a fat middle aged woman.""




My dad accidentally walked in on me when I was about to take a shower. Later, he sat me down and told me that he was ""horrified"" when he saw my fat body. He insinuated that my boyfriend was no longer attracted to me and was ""too nice"" to tell me that I needed to lose weight. I told him that I had spoken to my boyfriend and he said that he was still attracted to me and he loved me the way I am. My dad responded by saying ""No"" and shaking his head. 




When I was in graduate school lost so much weight that my periods stopped, my skin was dry, my hair fell out, and I weighed 106 lbs. However, I was so tired and hungry that I binged my way to 188 lbs. He has been telling me to lose weight for 12 years but I only became overweight this year. I've asked him multiple times to stop making comments about my body. I told him that it was hurtful and inappropriate. He won't stop. He thinks he is doing me a favor because no one else will tell me that I am fat. He has told me that it is appropriate for him to tell me to lose weight because he is ""preserving my beauty"" and ""as a female"" I need to watch my weight. 





My mom is in her fifties, gave birth to three children, and has a BMI of 19. My dad told her to do crunches to flatten her stomach. I have two sisters in high school. Once they started taking antipsychotic medications, they gained weight as a side effect and my dad started harassing them too. They are not allowed to drink soda or eat sweets now but he let them eat tons of sugary foods when they were children because they were skinny. I'm genuinely confused about why he is so preoccupied about our weight when he has three unstable daughters who have all been involuntarily hospitalized at some point for mental health issues. 





I can't take this anymore. Evey time my dad sees me or walks past me he tells me that I need to lose weight. I know that I am overweight and I know how much work it takes to lose 50+ lbs. When he constantly tells me to lose weight, it does not motivate me or encourage me. It just makes me angry and hurt. He tells me that I need to lose weight more often than he asks me how I am or how my day was. 



What am I supposed to say when he says these hurtful things to me? How do I stop feeling hurt because of what he is saying? I want to avoid him but I have to see him on a regular basis at the moment.

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 10 months now. We met in College because we lived on the same floor of residence, and it was awesome. Living a few doors down from my gf was new and exciting and we had an amazing time throughout the rest of our year. We really connected and both agreed that we have something special going on.

Things were a little rocky at first as we adjusted to the whole long distance thing. Its especially hard when one of us is going out to the club or bar, it's like all of a sudden I'm feeling super jealous and nervous, and I've never really been the jealous type, neither has she. We've made it work out alright so far, but God damn is it ever difficult trying to communicate through texts/snapchats.

269,throwaway1238527,Relationships,10,c73aoi,1," Throwaway for obvious reasons.  
 I \[26F\] have been with my current boyfriend \[27M\] for about 4 years. We started our relationship as long-distance, seeing each other only on weekends or on the odd holidays.   
 When I finished college, I began looking for jobs, and after a year I decided it was time to be closer to him. So we decided that I would look for a job in his city, because he already had a job and wanted to keep his career at that company going (I was unemployed).  
 A few months ago I moved to his city. I intended to go live with him renting an apartment, but I initially stayed at his parents? house (he still lives with his parents), so I could start the new job and see if I actually fit in at the workplace before we got a place of our own.  
 That?s where the problems began: after a while, I couldn?t live at his parents? home anymore, for different reasons. They are really good to me, but they have a rocky relationship (they fought a lot, the atmosphere at home was tense all the time), and plus I didn?t have much flexibility or privacy, and I didn?t want to take advantage of their hospitality.  
 My bf often told me how he wanted to buy a house together, and that?s what I want too, but I first wanted to rent so we could see if living together could work or not. We couldn?t agree on that, so I told him I would first get my own apartment and live on my own until I got a more stable job contract, and he?d be welcome to join me. He didn?t.  
 And that?s how the fighting began: he is so bent on just buying the house, saying renting is a waste of money, he can?t accept any other option. The thing is, right now I don?t have enough savings to split the cost of a house, I just have enough to live on rent and save some money.   
 After fighting and fighting he conceded going to live on rent, but only for a few months, but it?s still not good enough for me, cause I would need more time to save the money for the house. He proposed that he?d pay my part, too, but I don?t want to feel like I owe him money. We are still living separately.  
 I just felt so confused, and angry, because I gave up my life at my city, my friends, my family to stay with him, and now he wouldn?t live with me because he?d have to pay rent.  
 All of this made me reconsider our relationship. Lately, he?s been acting really rashly, and a couple times treated me with little respect.   
 We always had trouble communicating, because he?s that kind of guy who never talks about a problem, and I always have to beg him to talk to me. Otherwise, he wouldn?t do it.   
 I feel tired, and I have doubts. Am I pretending too much? Am I exaggerating about the house? I?m really not sure right now, and I was hoping that trying to live together would clear my mind. 

TL;DR: bf wants to buy house, I want to rent first so we can test our relationship, we can?t find a way to agree on this. Also communication problems on his part.

So Dan started talking to me, casual stuff at first, but then things got a little bit weird. He started leaning on closer and closer and told me that I am the hottest girl he ever met.

I need someone to tell me this is normal and that I will get my old feelings back. I have no one to talk to that can relate to this because of his job being so peculiar.

He and I had very different ideologies, perspectives on religion, and political views. I originally said I didn?t think it would work out with us and turned him down when he asked me out. Several weeks later, I still still felt something for him so decided to try it out and we started dating. There was always that pressure looming over us in regards to the fact that it probably wouldn?t work out long term, and now I realize I never should?ve gotten into it in the first place. He seemed to have very deep feelings for me and I liked him, but didn?t want to make it work out long term and just felt like having a fun and casual relationship in the short term. He was definitely the wrong guy to do that with. I feel so terrible and like I led him on and wasn?t careful with his feelings. 

I have always had trouble feeling deeply for people in my relationships. My last relationship I lost feelings for after around a year, and looking back on it, I?m not sure if I ever loved him. I struggle to find a romantic encounter that doesn?t make me feel sick to my stomach, and I actually felt SOMETHING for this new guy so I wanted to give it a try. I am so lonely and want to find some kind of romantic relationship with somebody, but my feelings always prevent me from doing so. I am frustrated with myself that I keep hurting people and I feel selfish for just wanting something low commitment, because I really think that?s all I can give.

Background: this girl and I dated for 2 months and I cared/care about her deeply and would do anything for her. 

I got extremely close with her friends and family as well. Well last night we had dinner reservations and she texts me to cancel them and to pick her up so we can talk. 

She gets into my car and tells me how she isn?t happy rn and how that being in a relationship isn?t going to make her happy in the other facets of her life. She also said that she had only been feeling this way for an hour.

Lastly she said that since I was leaving for college she didn?t want to get too serious before I was about to leave.

Hearing this broke me because all I had ever tried to do was make her happy. 

This is also the first time I have ever cried over a girl because my prior relationships were terrible.

I told her that if her not wanting to be with me made her happy then I was for it.

We texted later on last night and I asked if we were broken up or on a break and she said we were broken up for now.

And I said so we?re on a break then. And she said yeah sure. And then I asked again cause I needed clarity and a definitive answer.

She said she doesn?t know what she wants. I told her that since she?s going to be out of town for a week she can tell me how she feels when she gets back.

He was so mean. Basically said ?yeah I?m not fucking into it. I want things to be fresh and exciting? 
I would do so much for him, surprise him with things, leave him love notes, etc.

My ex and I were together for 3 years, he was a drug addict who ended up in prison 2 weeks after we found out I was pregnant. I changed my phone number, moved, and deleted all social media to get away from him. I met my current bf at 8 months pregnant (we've been together for 7 months now). Every time I mention my ex in any regards my bf gets annoyed and initiates arguments about how I might not be over him. How do I explain my feelings of traumatic experiences that make me think about him rather than romantic feelings???



I met the father of my daughter when I was 14. He was the new guy in school which every girl desired. 2 years later after he moved away again we started talking on Facebook randomly. We met and instantly hit it off, at this point I knew nothing of his drug use. Months later he introduced marijuana to me and told me he had been doing it every day for years. After this encounter it was a slippery slope which included xanax, cocaine, lean, and lastly the ""phone call"".

The phone call I received was 2 hours after I left his place. His mother frantically begged me to drive back to the house to check on my ex and that an ambulance was on the way. At midnight the night before my senior finals (high school) I snuck out and showed up to my unconscious boyfriend who had OD'd on heroin. They were able to resuscitate him and my graduation party was in a few days. This was the first time he was going to meet my family, or so I thought.. That day I heard nothing from him. He never showed up. He never called. He never texted. The next day he called and said he was on his way to Florida for Rehab, we lived in upstate NY. 

Soon after, his ex gf sent me pictures of them in a hotel having sex the night of my grad party. This was the end of our relationship - the first time. Being young and naive this went on over and over 4 times. His rap sheet of abuse for me includes cheating too many times to count, smuggling drugs in my car, dealing in my car, uploading revenge porn of me, verbally belittling me, threatening to kill any man who cares for our child, and trying to force me to get an abortion. 

There is so much more to the story of my past relationship, I could write a book.

282,elephant_shoezzz,[new],22,c72nt5,3,"Hi! A few weeks ago I went on an okay date with a guy and was thinking about going out with him again, but he started calling me a ?bitch? as a jokey nickname. When I told him to stop calling me that, he pushed back saying it was an empowering term and meant I was a strong woman. I told him to stop calling me a bitch because it was not his place to decide that and he finally stopped.

The actual full dealbreaker was that he called me dumb when I told him I thought it was Wednesday all day but it was a Thursday. Oddly enough that bothered me more, so I said I wanted to stop communicating. He responded with walls of texts so I said ?Stop texting me? to make it 100% clear. He didn?t.

He had found me on FB without my number being tied to the account and without knowing info about me, and now he has my last name. The reason I haven?t blocked him is because I want to know if he threatens me.

After I ignored him on his personal phone, he started texting me on his work phone. Images of him in the field working (I was curious about his engineering job before he pissed me off) and asking why I won?t respond. He also blamed being from India for the ?confusion? and briefly spoke in broken English to try to explain why he had called me those things. He has a Master?s from the US and speaks English better than many native speakers. Clearly it was a manipulative technique.

I?m getting pissed. I know I can block him but I don?t feel 100% safe without knowing if he?s escalating. He hasn?t made a threat but he has not respected my request and is now saying he misses me (we met once.)

I kind of want to contact his employer and let him know he is harassing me through the phone they gave him to get him to stop, but I feel like this may make things worse. I also acknowledge that this is partially me wanting to get him back but for fuck?s sake, it?s NOT okay to do this.

Is this a not proportional response to his behavior? I want him to know you cannot pull this shit.

283,missmamsir,Relationships,11,c72i71,10,"I've been wanting my boyfriend to move in with me for quite awhile now. We've been with each for almost 4 years. In the beginning he was actually living with his folks, because he was job hunting and it was hard for him to find a graphic design job. At one point I offered him to live with me, but he refused. About a year or more later he finally got a full time job, but it was contract work for a guy who had him come in every week day, his pay wasn't consistent but he had something. We've had other fights during this time, and I've tried to let him go, but we seem to get back together weeks after. When he was finally ready to move out, he said he wanted his own apartment to experience having his own apartment, that he felt it was important to have that kind of experience. I was a bit resentful, but I tried to understand. A year later when his lease was ending,? he was unsure of us because of drama, and he ended up not ending the lease. But weeks later we got back together. He decided to move in with me, but not closing his lease and just staying with me. He had gotten a new job and it was only 14 minutes from his current place. But I guess he wanted to keep it as a backup incase I broke up with him again, given our past breakups. I didn't see it that way though. I felt bitter that he still had that place even though he was staying with me for awhile. He said it was kind of like a trial run, though it lasted 5 months. 

Since then we're still together. We were going to get a new apartment,? but he seemed unsure of it. But I'm very particular, I want the windows to be facing the sunlight, I want windows that would work for my cat, I have a cat flap thing she can use to get out in case of a fire and I want it so that she can have a way of getting down easier. I want an apartment with a washer and dryer in the unit itself. I want a second bedroom so one of us can have an extra room for computers or something. 

So now since the apartment didn't happen, I want to get a house. To be honest I'm tired of living in apartments. But I want him to be apart of that. Though, I'm seriously looking at places that are a bit farther for him... it would be over an hour drive for him and maybe 25 minutes for me, but the houses up north are so much cheaper and better looking. I'm like falling in love with these houses. He really doesn't like the distance and he acts unsure and sad about it. I've been asking him a lot, and maybe putting pressure on him, but it only makes things worse.

His deal is that he wants us to see a counselor for awhile before moving in. He wants us to build our relationship base. I rather us get a place first, and work on that while living together. But our leases are coming up and there's not much time for that. After 4 years he should know if he wants to be with me. 

He says he wants wants me to working on my ""passive aggressiveness"", but lately that mostly stems from bitterness of our situations where I think we should be by now. Also anger issues, which I think I've gotten a lot better on personally. He says I'm manipulative... but I don't really see it. He doesn't like that gift giving is kind of my love language, or acts of service, he's more on the touch and words spectrum of that. He says I can get impatient.He says that I speak cryptically, and wants me to work on that. He doesn't like my level of ethics... I get a bit mad if he kills a bug, and how I talk about plastic bags and plastic waste all the time, he gets annoyed with that. He says I lie often... but they're mostly just white lies to save someone from feeling bad. Also I guess he wishes I were more into video games so he can play with me, an I'm more into reading. I wish he were more into reading, personally... but I'm fine with the fact that is isn't. 

The living situation has been hard for us and we feel a bit stressed out and not sure what to do. I've asked others what I should do, and they just say to do what makes me happy. But I feel either decision will make me sad, either having to leave him again or getting my own house.


Tl;dr: boyfriend and I have broken up now and then through the years. We're still together and I want a house. I want him to be a part of it, but the location I'm looking at is a bit far from his new job that pays well. About 25 minutes for me, about an hour or more for him.

My parents are divorced and my sister (also 20F now) and I would spend every weekend and some weeknights with them. Annie didn?t have a job and was much younger than my dad; part of the reason she started dating him is because he earns a decent amount of money and she wanted to live a certain lifestyle. She also was the definition of crazy. She would be manipulative, turning my father against us by lying about bad things we did or demonizing us for no reason. I think she had mental health issues and exhibited paranoid schizophrenic symptoms where she would frequently lash out at us for things we never even said or did. My dad and her would constantly fight and I think they were physically and emotionally abusive to each other as well. At the time, things were so bad that they both turned to alcohol and would get black out drunk every single night and fight. Also it?s important to note that Annie would target my sister (who has a disability, making her an easy target) in particular and would harass and make fun of her for her disability. Once she locked her in her room for hours and refused to give her food or water, telling my dad she deserved it because she apparently stole her clothes (she did not, she was like 12 years old for God?s sake).  Annie also was anorexic and tried to dictate what me and my sister ate by purposefully making us unhealthy food so she would feel better about herself, contributing to some disordered eating patterns, especially in my sister. I know my father isn?t perfect and definitely contributed to the toxic environment at times, but I feel that his relationship with Annie was the main issue here. 

As a whole, the whole situation was abusive and toxic growing up, and my sister has been diagnosed with PTSD from the abuse (my dad doesn?t know this - he is in denial about the effect that this had on us). He eventually broke up with her when I became very depressed and refused to ever see him again unless he broke up with her. After breaking up with her, he told me he felt much better and was happier. He?s been trying to repair our relationship since then and I have forgiven him for the most part. My sister, however, barely talks to him. 

Yesterday he texted me that he is back together with her. I?m feeling so many emotions and I can?t believe he would get back together with the woman who made my life a living hell when I was just a vulnerable kid. Who turned him into an abusive alcoholic because shes psychotic, manipulative, and unstable. When I told my sister, she started crying hysterically after I even mentioned Annie?s name. I know that he?s an adult who can make his own decisions and that he is probably lonely, but I don?t want to relieve my traumatic childhood. I never want to see Annie again. 

I don?t know how to handle this situation. Should I cut him off? Do I set boundaries? How do I stop feeling like he is betraying me and my sister? How can I make him understand how awful she was to my sister and me so many years ago?

285,Throawaydnenej22,Relationships,2,c72h5c,1,"So long story short, I met my girlfriend through one of my friends that I used to work with while we were hanging out in his apartment one day. Though she?s a lot younger, I couldn?t tell that there was an obvious maturity gap and that she had many issues.

He warned me as well as our mutual friend that she has problems, gets attached very easily, and is crazy. For some dumb reason I still proceeded to pursue her.

She has bipolar II, panic disorder, ptsd. depression, and anxiety. 

I first knew something was wrong when we went out to dinner for the first time with my parents so she could meet them. After not even 10 minutes into meeting my parents, she?s telling them all the mental issues she has and is being an open book about her whole life. My dad and I both gave each other a look because she was being too open about everything.

As a few months went on, I saw all of her mental problems come out whether it was from switching from being lovey to very distant and quiet due to the bipolar, having panic attacks regularly, crying 3x per week at night saying she just wants to kill herself, cutting herself, etc.. way too much for me to handle.

A month ago we went on a road trip and I made the decision last minute to pick up my friend and his girlfriend so they could come, which my girlfriend was perfectly fine with. We went out to a restaurant in the town that night and she said she wanted to go back to the hotel to sleep afterwards. My friends and I were still wide awake and my friend?s girlfriend asked if it would be okay if we dropped her off at the hotel so we could go dancing at a club. My girlfriend flipped out and threw a 3 year old-like tantrum in the restaurant, saying they weren?t even supposed to come and was bawling her eyes out. It was so ridiculous my best friend, who is incredibly laid back, spoke up and told her she needed to quiet down because she was being incredibly rude and disrespectful. We all went hiking the next day and she kept stopping so we had to wait up for her and had her arms crossed the whole time being miserable.

Since I?m 22, I have a few old friends from college who I have hooked up with in the past, usually a one time kind of thing and just stayed friends after for 3-4 years now. My girlfriend is incredibly rude to them and told them that they can?t hug me when they see me since we had sex and can only shake my hand when I see them. I forgot to comply to her ?rule? one time with my friend since she was going on a trip for 4 months and hugged her, and my girlfriend threw a fit on the way home bawling her eyes out saying I?m an asshole who doesn?t care and called her mom telling her mom how much of an asshole I am.

Things have only been getting worse. There?s some good aspects to our relationship and I do care about her a bunch, but the love is gone out the window. She cares about me a ton and helps me the best I can but her mental illnesses get in the way a bunch and she wants to kill herself because she knows that they are the reason that people leave her.

She?s been very suicidal the past week and cried her eyes out the other night saying that she didn?t want me to leave her and that she just wanted to die which really broke my heart into pieces. She always says she wishes she wasn?t so fucked up and I saw that she saved an article on her phone that was titled ?Can you be loved if you have bipolar disorder?? which killed me inside since I felt so bad.

I don?t know what to do. I?m miserable half the time and happy the other half and I know it?s not entirely her fault. None of my friends like her and though my family does, they know she?s extremely fucked up mentally. I feel like if I do decide to leave she?ll kill herself for sure.

287,snoopy0987,Dating,10,c72evv,1,"Hi everyone,

I (27F) met a guy (30M) online almost 3 months ago on Tinder. Things have been going ok, due to his trading projects and living an hour away, we just meet once a week. We would stay in touch by sending a text here or there everyday. We've been sleeping together for a month (no condom if that's relevant) but haven't discussed exclusivity (I know...). I haven't really met his friends but he's met mine and they get on really well. My friends seem to like him.

I really like the guy because up until I met him, I had been single for 3 years and burned in the last relationship. I don't like anyone I know in person and I wouldn't progress most first dates due to a lack of spark. I don't feel like dating others at this point and tbh I tend to only date one person at a time. Talking about previous partners, he didn't  come across as someone into casual hookups but maybe a bit oblivious.

The problem is that I knew from the very beginning he would be going away for a month. He is currently away and we never discussed communicating whilst on holidays. Even then  he did send me a text here and there, and I know he has met other travellers (mostly women his age) that he's hanging out with. All of a sudden, he has stopped replying even though he has been online. It's been 4 days.

I know it's unreasonable to expect him to send me a text on holiday but the break in pattern has made me really nervous. Partly, I'm also annoyed at myself because I've been cheated on before and I feel the same sort of anxiety which doesn't make sense at this stage anyway :(

So I'm after some advise; I don't plan on texting him until he does (if ever) and will go online to date or keep myself busy. Do you think I'm being irrational or this is his way of distancing himself or meeting other women on holiday and reconnecting when he's back?

First you need to know that there are four main people in this: me(16M), my best friend(16M), the girl I love(will call her A)(16F) and her best friend (will call her L)(16F).

From 5 to 8 years old I was friend with this girl(A) at school. From that moment I had not talked to her until recently. 

My best friend who is 16 years old knows me since 4-5 years. Recently me and many of my friends(including my best friend) started being friends with the girl I was friend with a few years ago. So we became friends for the past 3 months, the girl recently introduced us to her best friend. About a month ago we learned that (A) was in love with my best friend but he soon told her that he did not love. She accepted it and they stayed friends. 

About two weeks ago, we started having parties all together since school year was done. So my best friend started loving the girl I love's best friend. L and my best friend started loving each other recently. 

Now about the girl I love... I realize more and more how I love her since around three weeks. I talked to her a lot. She talked to me a lot about how she felt stressed and eveything because her best friend was with my best friend. She really doesn't want it to ruin her friendship with both of them. She told me that she did not love my best friend anymore and that she was not jealous but I believe that is not completely true seing how depressed she is recently. 

The girl I love just seems perfect  to me. The most impressing I realized is that I didn't fall in love with her because of her beauty but because of her personnality and how kind and intelligent she is. Since that moment I can't stop thinking about her. I told it to one of my other friends. I really can't know if she loves me too. We recently talked a lot about when we were young and both looked at pictures from our childhood. I only hugged her once one night at a party but for a few seconds. I went to sleep at her house with other friends yesterday. You need to know that she is very easily anxious about things. That night we all went outside to walk and me and one friend went away running from them(it was just a joke and I knew how to back to her house). So me and one friend in the streets for about 15 mins and they were searching for us. After some time they came back to her house and she was so shocked that she almost cried, we both came back to her feeling bad. I was then able to apologize to her and I believe she accepted my apologies. 

The other day I also went shopping with her and her best friend(two girls and me). I bought some clothes that they helped me choose. 

Another thing is that she is leaving in two days and yesterday was the last time I would see her for a while. She goes on a group trip for a bit more than a month, I find it really hard to not see her anymore for so long. I also don't want to stop talking to her during that time. 

The last thing is that next year all my friends go to different schools. Two of my friends go study in other town and the rest of them splits in two main schools. Of course I'm going to another school where none of them go, even the girl I love. I don't know how to interpret that but sur recently told me that she regretted not coming there too. So we are not going to be in the same school next year which means less chances of talking. At least her school is about ten minutes walk from where I will be, so hopefully we can stil meet sometimes.

I recently thought a lot and came very close to telling her that I'm in love with her. But I don't want to make her stress more or make her feelon't forced to love me.

Thanks if you read all that and sorry if it was hard to understand, I'm not normaly speaking english.

TL;DR  
I love a girl who a few weeks ago, love my best friend. She leaves soon for a month and I will not be at the same school as her next year. Please answer my questions or give me advice.

Now I have a few questions (any answer could help me):
-Should I completely forget the girl I love?
-Should I simply tell her my feelings? If so then should I wait for her to come back from her trip? 
-Is there any chance that she loves me?
-Should I ask one of my friends what to do?
-Any other advice is welcome",1561830906.0,Need advice on my relationship with a girl I love but don't know if she loves me,0.99
289,misspeachesz,[new],18,c72aws,28,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years and we have a very happy marriage. He started working at a new job two months ago and a coworker developed a crush on him. She expressed her interest. He told me that he told her he was in a happy marriage and he couldn't return her feelings. 

Last night I read some texts between them that made me not only trust her, but also how he feels about her. He told her she was cute. He added that he can't like her back because he's married and she has a boyfriend, but if they had met at another time in life he would honestly give her a shot. Why did he have to say this? Another thing I picked up is before she admitted her feelings they were hugging each other on a constant basis!! He just told her that they need to stop because he doesn't want to overstep his boundaries and give people the wrong idea.

I understand that he did the good thing in drawing the line, but I feel like she is going to keep pushing. I also feel like he was giving her hope and didn't reject her properly. He doesn't know that I know about these texts so I don't know how to confront him.

290,terrordactyl20,[new],48,c729m8,50," I'm a fairly regular customer at this place and we've been flirting for weeks. Last week he offered to let me borrow a personal copy of his book. I didn't accept but I started reading it online this week at work out of boredom. So I mentioned this to him last night and he offered again to let me borrow his copy, so I said yes, if he didn't mind.

We spend the rest of the time talking and he even brings up the fact that he's single. Constant flirting and always poking fun at me and teasing me. When I pay out, I look at him and say ""SO, when do I get my book?"" At this point, the bar had gotten a little more crowded, so he looked at my phone and I gave it to me and he put his number in. But then he says ""Text me and let me know when you'll be here, I work these days."" He already knows that I know when he works and he could have just said come by and pick it up Tuesday but instead voluntarily put his number in my phone without me asking and this was after he told me he was a really private person. He also had friends at the bar as well that were sitting next to me so I'm thinking he was just playing it cool. Thoughts? When should I text him? I have a major crush on him and would actually like to hang out at some point but I don't want to cross any boundaries.

291,pomegranatecoffee,Relationships,9,c728zn,1,"Maybe not the shortest story but here we go. Starting from the very beginning I was dating a guy (m23) for a year when I went to study abroad for four months. Things were pretty bad for us already and I kinda knew we would just break up eventually but I kept trying. After a month away I started to talk to ?Mike? (21) that was also there for the same program and I had no hidden intentions I swear he was just pure and very nice to talk to. Second month Mike kissed me and I found myself falling for him. Told my now ex to which he responded if I wanted to make him jealous I had to try harder... I didn?t start a full relationship with Mike but, yeah, i definitely didn?t turn him down either. 

I got very mad at my now ex actually and at that time me and Mike were in a group of friends and they introduced us to some new people. We met them few times and I became very friendly with ?Brad? (22). He was telling me about his gf and I felt okay telling him all about my relationships. Though one night when we were all together things got very tense with Mike and he left the whole group. I felt confused bc he never acted anywhere near this and honestly the whole situation was already messed up. We were also drinking a bunch and I ended up kissing Brad and we made out (no sex). Yes, I regret that a lot. And honestly I was a bitch. 

Anyways, I told Mike that I kissed that dude and he just broke down. Hardly talked, almost didn?t eat for days. After that I just couldn?t bring myself to tell him the rest. Which ofc I should have. 

Month three and my now ex almost never texted me first and I was pretty sure he had cheated again (yup),  STILL I came to Mike and told him that I wanted to stay with that guy. He said okay but, well, we weren?t able to stop talking. 

So month four I was finally able to put an end to that comedy of a relationship. Didn?t believe we would continue dating with Mike after we came back home (he?s from USA, I?m from Europe) but I decided even if it was few days it?d be worth much more than a year with my ex. Took me quite long to realize. Well, 6 months of long distance and we?re still together. Or at least I think so. 

All January and February were like a fairytale. I could never imagine a guy more perfect. I fell so hard for him. In March he came to visit, met my family and we were also very touchy. Things got pretty bad in April when he couldn?t stop thinking about how long it took me to let go of my ex and how I cheated on him with Brad. I told him it was a mistake and that I was drunk and messed up but I know these are no excuses. He spent few weeks trying to hurt me, called me a slut and other names, said he regretted coming and just was very mean. But when I cried it wasn?t only bc I got hurt. It was also bc he was hurting me bc he himself was hurt. It sucked. 

In May I was trying to calm him down and make him understand that I truly cared about him and loved him. He started saying I love you back. Then in June he came again. Things got better since we were close to each other again but then he learned the whole truth about Brad. He broke down into pieces again, cried his soul out, I cried next to him bc I saw how much he was hurting. Then he punched me and started to hurt himself. After he calmed down a bit I told him ?go on, break up with me now?. He burst into tears again and said he would but he just couldn?t. Both his stays we also had a lot of good sex which also completes he story. 

That day he told me he had cheated on me in April with the girl I?ve been jealous of. Full time. He also said it was ?very hard to do? since he only did it to hurt me. Success. 

I was kind of happy I got the burden off my chest and that I don?t hide anything from Mike now but he says he can?t believe anything I say. Can?t blame him. I?m also mad that I can?t let go of him. Every time the word ?breakup? comes up I start crying and I shake a lot. 

I?m supposed to go to him for two months but I?m scared and I think he doesn?t want me to come. Yet he keeps on making plans with me. I do truly adore him and I think he does love me but maybe too much damage has been done. Idk. I feel terrible for still wanting him after what I have done to him. But we still have feelings for one another and I want to go and be with him no matter the cost. 

I know it?s fucked up. I know you?re all going to tell me I have no right to be with him. What I?m looking for is an advice how to make this hurt less. Is it okay if I want to go? If anything I want to talk things through in person. This LDR is not making it any easier. 

I probably missed a lot of stuff here. If anyone was brave enough to read all the way here and maybe leave me an opinion, please don?t assume anything that was not stated. I?d appreciate any type of non insulting comments but those are also opinions so.. Thank you.

292,Rainforestcafeno1fan,Relationships,11,c7266v,3,"I?m having a really hard time getting over this. This guy i was seeing for a few months, he?s all of my firsts, he was really into it at the start but then his interest started to wane and would only return when I seemed disinterested. A few weeks ago he told me he never really sees himself being with me. I was upset about that for a few weeks but I know that he does really like me and he goes to therapy for anxiety that has something to do with me. A few nights ago I accused him of using me as a rebound for a girl that he never dated but felt he was in love with for two years; she had rejected him only a month before we started talking. He wasn?t really sure of what a rebound was or felt like so he denied it, but then he went on to tell me that he still really likes her, he?s not over, and that the more he talked about her the more he wanted to message her. He told me that he doesn?t really know her ?privately? as he?s only interacted with her in groups of people or on Snapchat, and said that he has a theory that he wouldn?t like her if he tried to date her because he didn?t know her in that sense and her behavior was ?questionable.? I think he was starting to warm up to the idea that I was just his rebound at this point because he tells me that he?s still not over her but that he?ll deal with his emotions however he pleases. Which I was thinking that meant he acknowledges he used me as a receptacle for whatever leftovers emotions he had for this girl and then he got bored with me and realized I?m not her, not what he really wanted, and he was able to move on really quickly because of it?

I kept telling him over and over that I still really like him and want to be with him and that I would wait out whatever issues he has, and he kept being really cold and comparing my situation with him to how he felt about her, when he used to give me reassurance that he would come back to me. When I said I really liked him and just want him to like me back he would say ?I know how you feel? ?don?t wait on me...I did for her...and it didn?t work? and it just really hurts because even as early as last week he was saying that he still likes me and has the capacity to love me but that he just needs time. And then a few days ago it changed to him saying we should part ways and not talk to each other anymore, and if we do it should only be to ?catch up as if we?re old friends.? 
Through me being super emotional during this conversation he kept bringing up how he masturbated to one of my pictures and how he really wants to have a three way with my best friend and I. He then proceeds to tell me that he could never get himself off to that girl he really liked for two years and I was wondering why was there such a stark difference? Like how can he get himself off to one of my pictures but absolutely can?t to one of hers?

And then another point of the conversation that really hurts me is when I asked if he still liked her and he said he still really likes her but not at the deep level that he used to, but that he was sure if he started talking to her again he could get to that point. I asked him if he was in love with her and he said he didn?t know. I asked him if he still liked me and he said ?it depends on what you mean by that? and I said in the same way you liked her and he said no but he wasn?t sure of how to articulate the difference in how he liked me versus her. 
He kept trying to convince me that he?s a nice person with no intention to ever hurt me before this whole conversation, and then all of a sudden throughout the whole thing he was saying ?I?m a bad person? ?you dodged a bullet? ?you don?t deserve me? and showing me his tinder profile all while I?m trying to tell him that I still like him and trying to remind him of the times when he would beg me to stay with him, beg me to tell him tell him more about myself, beg me to make him put effort into our relationship. It just hurts and confuses me that he?s still hung up on a girl that he doesn?t know privately very well and doesn?t like him. It hurts that he still likes her after three months of yanking on my emotions while I tried to do my best for him and us, all while he was still fixed on this other girl.

293,PalmsAreSweaty15,[new],2,c7259a,1,"I?m 26f and I?m finally realizing that my mom?s (56f) toxic attitude played a very crucial role in my development, my confidence and what not. 

I always keep second guessing every single thing in my life. I?ve got terrible anxiety and it all has something to do with the way I was treated as a child. 

I vividly remember how excited I was about an event in dance school. My teacher had asked all her students to let our parents know they they?d need to reach out to her for passes for the event. I messed up the name of the event and when my mom reached out for the wrong event, my dance teacher snapped at her saying ?oh that?s an exclusive event and I doubt you?re invited to that. But perhaps your daughter meant this other event , and yes , I?ll send you the passes for it? and blah blah. Anyway, my mom was so embarrassed about it that, she made me feeel so bad for messing up the name of the event and yelled at me. She looked at me in a very disgusting way and I?ll never forget how I felt about myself after it - I was just disgusted with myself. Looking back, I wish my mom had just stood up to my teacher for her nasty attitude by saying ?oh she messed up the name of the event, she?s just a child. But yes, we didn?t mean to beg for an invitation to your exclusive event, we just want passes for the other one?. 

This is just ONE of many incidents where i was gaslighted. My mom would constantly ridicule my face for all the acne it carried and I?d retaliate by crying and begging her to take me to a skin doctor. I still remember our first visit to the skin doctor. The doctor said ?but she has very little to no acne, she?s got beautiful skin. Let?s not take any medication for this, it will clear up naturally as she ages?. 

She was extremely nosy; we lived in India for a bit where we employed a driver and my mom would constantly ask me if I had an affair with him. She would ask why I d suddenly started dressing up after the new driver was employed. My answer? I?m fucking 15 I want to feel beautiful! 


Anyway, growing up with a highly insecure and toxic mom didn?t do me any good with my confidence! I feared being judged constantly. 
My brother had it worse - he was a nerd who didn?t make any friends and my mom made a big deal out of it. She?d constantly cry to all my family about how she suspects he?s an abnormal child and she worries he has no friends. She?d do this in front of my brother and I can only imagine how such a little boy would feel - watching his mom cry over him, causing a scene, wondering to every member of the family if he is an abnormal child or not. (Don?t worry, the man is doing so great in his career and has plenty of friends, investors and what not. )

As for me, I got lucky! Moved out, lived alone, met wonderful people and finally, got smart enough to realize that I?d been gaslighted. Problem is, anxiety still gets to me and I still second guess myself. I can?t get my moms critical voice out of my head but i know that if I do, it will unleash a side of me that I?d fall in love with. I want to get my moms voice out of my head. 

Bigger problem: she wants to live with me for 3 months and whenever she does, she constantly judges me, gets nosy about my relationship and is a mean person! 
When I told her about my current boyfriend she demanded to know our love story. When I told her I asked him out, she was so disgusted. She said it was so desperate for a woman to ask a man out. 

Today, I told her about how I was so happy that my boyfriend?s mom donated to a fundraising campaign on Facebook for my birthday. She judged me instantly by saying ?it is so desperate that you?d ask for people to donate money in your name for your birthday?(it was not in my name. I simply shared a Facebook campaign hoping people would donate)

Long story short, I feel like I need to get her out of my life. I would just be so much happier. Yet, it?s hard to do because she?s my mom and she has had a very bad history which makes her insecure, and I emphasize with it. But she feels that because her past wasn?t good, she has every right to be a bitch. 

TL;DR: My mom has gaslighted me my whole life. She?s judgemental towards me and uses very harsh language. This has caused me to be very critical of myself, causes anxiety, I always second guess myself and I?m not as confident as I want to be. In order to get her voice out of my head, I feel like I need to phase her out of my life. But, I understand why she?s who she is. She hasn?t had a great past.

294,srkate,[new],26,c722s5,4,"We?ve been seeing each other a little under 10 months now. Things are good, we have our little things like any couple but nothing big at all. Last weekend he wanted me to go to this party with him, I wasn?t super into it because he would be the only one I knew but I went and it was fine. We were on a boat with a bunch of guys aged 20-23max and a bunch of them were drinking. This one kid starts bragging about how he went to a strip club and got a strippers number and my boyfriend decided that would be a good time to ask me if I?d be cool with him going to one. And I said ?absolutely not 100% no way. I?d break up with you? I made it real clear. Did not sugar coat at all. And he was all shocked I said no. Thought I wouldn?t care whatever. I?m not the jealous type at all. He hangs out with girls often. He snaps and texts other girls. I literally do not care about that. But what girl would be cool with her boyfriend going to a strip club? Aside from the fact that obviously I?d be jealous I just think it?s scummy. If you?re a single guy then sure go for it, I personally think it?s still kind of gross but that?s just my opinion. To each their own. But if you?re in a committed relationship and you go to a strip club that shows me that first of all you have no respect whatsoever for the relationship you?re in. And I also just think that?s a scummy piece of shit thing to do. I think it makes you a shitty person and I don?t want those kinds of people in my life sorry. He said ?it?s an experience I want to have at some point because all guys have it? which isn?t true at all. Many many many guys I know have never and would never go to a strip club. He was bugged I said I wouldn?t be cool with it and I said ?if you want me to lie to you and tell you I?m cool with it I can do that... and then the next time I see you I can lie to you and tell you I?m breaking up with you for some bullshit reason too? I thought about it all week because it honestly bothered me so much that he even would want to do that. And he just mentioned it again. And honestly it hurts when he mentions it. I feel like I?m not enough for him or the relationship isn?t important enough for him if he feels the need to go watch half naked girls dance for money. I asked him if he?d be cool if I went to a male strip club and was sticking dollars in some dudes c*ck sock and he said if it was a bauchelorerte party he wouldn?t care. I just want to lay in bed and cry every time he mentions it. He knows I?m very very against it and a lot of times I show my sadness through anger or agitation so I think he feels like it would just make me angry. He doesn?t realize that it actually makes me so sad. Honestly the fact he even argued with me about wanting to go to one makes me feel like he?s not as good of a man as I thought he was and a little bit makes me want to end the relationship. I?m not going to but it?s definitely a big big step in that direction. If he feels like he?s missing out on important experiences because of our relationship then maybe we shouldn?t be in a relationship to begin with. Of course I?d be upset if things ended because he felt like he was missing out on too much but I?d be more upset biting my tongue and acting like I?m okay when I?m not. Even if he only did it once. I want to end this off by saying I have absolutely nothing against anyone working in the sex industry. I know many many people find it empowering and make great money through it. My issue is not with these people at all, my issue is with people in committed relationships doing these types of things because my personal opinion is that it is disrespectful to the relationship you?re in.

295,weirdestpotato,Dating,4,c722eb,1,"Here's a tl;dr because this is very long and I apologize.

\-> me and bf fight, he tells me he wants to breakup and calls me names my father used to when he verbally abused me. when we don't fight, he tells me he wants a family with me and to marry me.  Is it all my fault for being moody and depressed, or is it him too for seemingly being bipolar? 

&#x200B;

Hey all. I've posted here a few times already, and I really do feel stuck. As a bit of backstory, I (18f) have been with my bf (21m) for just over 7 months. I have past trauma I am really trying to work through. I was verbally and physically abused by my father (30s m). My mother never did anything to prevent it. I was not treated for depression or anxiety, but I was just put on anti anxiety meds, nothing for depression yet. I moved out of my folks house in february, to get away from my father, and moved into my bf's place. Now, I feel he's a bit bipolar, and the way he puts it, he makes it seem like it's my fault he's this way. I've been really depressed this past week, and I can't really help it. He's told me multiple times to just ""be happy for once in your goddamn life."" He's also told me I have no reason to be depressed, besides the fact that we have to move in a few weeks. Just yesterday we got in a fight because we tried to resolve some of his legal problems, and we couldn't. He got really frustrated, and started ranting. I told him, in a very calm voice, to please calm down. He got even more mad at me that he couldn't rant. He ended up punching his clipboard he had in his lap. This obviously scared me a lot, as my dad would hit me when he was very angry at me. We then stopped for food, where I told him I wasn't hungry. He got even more mad at me for not being hungry. When we got home, he told me if I left, I wasn't to come back. He continued to call me names, some of the same things my father would say to me. He told me that sometimes he wants to hurt me, but he never would because it's against his morals. After he was done ranting, we calmly talked about the situation. He hugged me, and I burst into tears, and almost hyperventilated because of crying so hard. Some days he's telling me he wants to marry me, and others he tells me he wants to breakup, especially right after a fight. I'm tired of these mixed signals, and my therapist suggested I bring him in again (we went in before to talk about the fights) to see if maybe we can work this out. I love him a lot, and when it's good, it's great. But when it's bad, it's bad. I don't really know if this is all my fault, which is what I tell myself because I've always done that, or if it's also him. Is it all my fault for being moody and depressed, or is it him too for seemingly being bipolar is the great question I'm asking today.",1561829288.0,Mixed signals,1.0

To give you a brief background--perhaps I will elaborate more in a different thread--but I have a friend who is ignoring my texts. I've since stopped texting her except for a birthday message, which also got ignored. 

Should I stop letting her borrow my Quizlet account? She wanted to share/use my Quizlet account since I had a Quizlet Plus subscription plan on it that lasts for three years (2016-2019). This was one of my questions/thoughts that I had to myself. The Quizlet was connected to my Gmail, so she also had access to my Gmail for that account. I've modified the Quizlet and Gmail to be separate now--one can access the Quizlet account via its own username and password and the Gmail account I've changed the password as well. Should I continue to let her share my Quizlet account and let her know of the changes, or just keep on going with my life? If she wants to reach out to me again, sure, maybe--I'll deal with that part if that ever happens. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr -- A friend is ignoring me, should I update her on the account details of the Quizlet Plus account that was under my Gmail/payment that I let her use as well?

298,voidantis,Relationships,4,c71vyo,1," So my (20F) boyfriend (20M) of six months hasn't been talking to me as much lately since the semester ended. I really don't know why. When school was in session, we were both busy but talked daily and tried to make plans at least once every two weeks to hang out. Since summer started, that's gradually gone down and down and I don't know why. I feel like all of a sudden I'm initiating everything. It's really fucking with my mind because I had an ex who literally purposely ignored me to ""see how I would react to it"" for months. My current boyfriend doesn't know about this because I didn't feel the need to bring it up and I didn't want to seem like I was complaining about an ex.

I know that he's currently working on a robotics project for his school and he has a pretty big role in it, but I still feel like he's ignoring me. I really can't tell if he is or not and I feel like my mind is trying to compare him to my ex, or maybe my mind is reacting to it so hard simply because the situation is reminding me of what my ex did. I don't know how to bring this up with him because I don't want to seem clingy or like a crazy girlfriend or like I'm demanding too much of his time. I knowwwww he's busy with his robotics project and applying for jobs and internships and scholarships and I don't want to bother him. Sometimes when we do hang out, he's only free for like three hours or so before he has to get back to work.

Another problem: he isn't the cause of my anxiety. I'm having a horrible family situation (don't want to explain it here, if you're curious look at my post history.) and I'm having massive anxiety attacks from it. I haven't told him about it yet; in fact, I've only told one friend, and I told her literally last week. I clearly have big issues with talking to ANYONE about problems in my life and I'm trying really hard to work through it. But I would feel horrible telling him about my family's predicament and stressing him out right now when he's already stressing about other things.

I just... want to talk to him. I need to tell him about this really bad because I feel like I'm hiding something. I want to hang out with him again without feeling like a burden. I love him so much and our relationship is/was amazing. What do I do?

299,hexgirll,Breakups,2,c71val,1,"Before going into things I just wanted to state that I am a woman (19) also just asking others for their opinion on the situation as I don?t have a lot of experience..! Basically, I woke up this morning to my ex(17,M) adding me on Instagram. We broke up almost a year ago and we had a really difficult break up. Granted he?s two years younger than me and when I went to college of course we were going to break up. There was no closure and I was very unhappy with the way things ended. However as time went on I realized I needed to work on myself and focus on myself and since then I have been such a better person. I blocked him when we broke up and recently I felt that I had enough closure to unblock him. I didn't feel extremely hurt anymore so I found it was unnecessary and petty from my perspective to keep him blocked. Looking back this was an adolescent relationship. After all, we grew up together and had many of the same mutual friends. 

Turns out he also recently broke up with his new girlfriend (who I think was a rebound, as it was so sudden and she was a freshman in high school...). I?m not even really interested in trying to get back together with him I know there?s always that possibility, but I?m really just focused on me and it?s so unrealistic to me as I?m in college and he is a senior in high school. I just have no idea what he wants from following me!!! We haven?t even talked since we broke up, at all, nothing!! I?ve had enough closure and really really worked on investing in me and my future. I?m not petty about the situation anymore so if he really wants to lurk on me he can see me living my best life... I?m just an inexperienced young woman and would like some other insight to this strange add on social media, what?s it even mean!?? Should I expect a DM or something from him within a few hours? I'm just confused...!

And what if I'm the rebound... I can't be... I was the original...?

You forgave her and all was good for a while, She had to go back home to your native country due to visa issues you thought about a long distance relationship and went through with it as she was worth it. You worked hard earned money so you can buy a ticket and visit her to make both of you happy. This went on for years, going home for a couple of months then going back you were young and had no responsibilities you weren't the best boyfriend but you made sure to see her and talk to her all the time. Then one night she tells you the truth, Those times you werent there with her she was fucking other people not just one but several. It looked as if she was trying to have a relationship with others but it wasnt working so she falls back to you. She apologizes and seemed truly sorry so you forgave her as you were more worried about how she saw herself and how hurt she was for hurting you. You wanted to stupidly be there for her even though she wronged you. You loved her that much. 6months later you went back to be with her you went on vacations and truly had a great time. You proposed to her as you thought that after everything that has happened she seemed to truly love you and has changed.  She goes to a different country with her family you were happy for her. At this point you are struggling you find out your probably going to be deported alongside with your parents and siblings soon due to visa issues. Your dad gets into drugs hard and you saw him try to kill himself. You are now the breadwinner of the family. It fucks you up but you dont tell her yet, You dont want to fuck her up too so you try your best to pretend everything is ok. After several attempts of her trying to make you open up, You finally do. you tell her everything and she was supportive initially. At this point she was also struggling thinking about how she hasnt finished any studies not even graduated college or anything for that matter. She finds a job but she absolutely hate it. She also seemed down but shes trying. Months later you feel worst you were probably more distant and gloomy and it affected her, It eats you up bit by bit how everything seemed to be slowly collapsing on to you. The only pillar of joy left in your life is her but you take that for granted, Unable to snap out from the shitty hand that was dealt to you, You feel worst and worst more distant probably. She probably felt alone too, as you were never there for her at the time. Months later she tells you she needs to talk about something important, She wants to have a break. At this point you felt an Indescribable pain in your chest like you were suffocating. You panic, begging and pleading but she was adamant to have this break. You try to give her space but everyday you call and ask why she did this. she doesnt answer yet. You feel like you are in an enclosed box suffocating slowly being laid into an endless bottomless ocean.  She finally tells you why, you havent been there for her. That proposal you made seemed pointless she says. You havent even planned anything she says. Are we just going to do this forever be away from one another she says. You have so many things going on with your life im not your priority she says. Knowing fully about your current situation and how you cant even get out of the country let alone go and live with her for good she tells you she doesnt want you. She then tells you shes been talking to another guy, She says she feels happy when shes with him. Theres no drama or problems just happy. She tells you she hasnt slept with him or even kissed him. You feel worst knowing that. At this point you have a mental breakdown. Working, sleeping, eating or anything that matters was extremely difficult you lost about 15 kilos within 6 weeks and nearly lost your job. Your only focus is to see her to talk to her person to person. You finally do it, You fixed everything you have a passport and a visa for good. You tell her youll see her, she reluctantly says yes which at this point is understable. You go to see her and she and her family welcomes you. You try your best to explain your side and admit your mistakes. It works for a while until you found out that she was secretly calling and texting the guy she initially left you for. It hurts but you suck it up you realize that shes been patient with you. she didnt have to do this, she didnt have to welcome you let alone talk to you, She had every right to leave you. You go back home your together again long distance, you felt as if you robbed her of her happiness.  You prioritize her in everything you do.  Everything was in order your father stops doing drugs and starts working again you fix your families visa issues.  Deep down inside you know she doesnt truly love you anymore and that shes only staying for you and not for her. You go to see her again everything seemed fine you plan things with her and tell her the next time you see her youll be there for good you as you finally have a concrete way of being together for good. Before you left to board the plane she starts crying and seemed truly upset she tells you shes sorry for everything and to come back and stay for good. You feel extremely sad and happy at the same time knowing that she does love you. Youre back home but it doesnt feel right again, She seemed more distant at this point its understable you just spent months together and youre now apart again. You start to argue more and one night she tells you not to go see her again or stay there but doesnt break up with you. She tells you she needs time. You obliged and at this point she returns back to being cold, distant and hurtful. She doesnt seem to care about anything that you do she belittles everything that you do and tells you about how youll be a terrible husband or a father for no reason other than to hurt you she knows thats all you really wanted to be a dad and a good husband. She calls you like old times but it feels as if its just a chore to shut you up so wont argue anymore, Every call is the same pattern, you ask her about her day she coldly tells you about it then silence. Everytime you tell her about yours shes not listening she doesnt care. You then realize that you ruined her life, You should of just let go back then. Now you feel worst, you want to end it for her sake but feel as if your doing the wrong thing you feel like your abandoning her because at this point she seemed trully lost and depressed. You tell yourself you are selfish and evil for taking away a possibility of a clean start and happiness with that person she left you for initially. 

You are a monster.

(TLDR) 9 years we have been together, 7 years of long distance and every year i go and see her. She left me before but i selfishly pushed myself to her and now i may have fucked both of us. I know i have to end it. I know i am selfish, I know i am stupid. But honestly the thought of leaving her has conflicted me. I truly feel like im abandoning her by leaving now Please dont judge me, i think we all make selfish mistakes at one point in our lives. Am i truly a monster? I just feel awful.

301,ParkertheEagle,Relationships,27,c71lcc,0,"My fianc?e and I have been dating for about a year and a half. We started dating in grad school and then she took a job in Canada, where she is from, and I took a job in the Southwest, where I am from. We have maintained our relationship, and have frequently flown out to see each other. We recently became engaged, and I moved up to Canada to live with her.  
She has a cat that she loves and adores. I am allergic to cats. This has always been a bit of an issue when I have visited before, but since I was only visiting, we didn't discuss it too much. Well, I moved in a little over a week ago, and my allergies have been awful. I have not slept well at all in the last week, and I constantly stuffy. It is just miserable.  
I have brought it up a few times, and she always just tells me to get allergy medication. I have asked her if we can at least keep the cat out of the bedroom, so I can sleep. She won't do that because she thinks the living room is too hot for the cat to sleep at night. Last night I slept on the couch because the cat was in the bedroom. She called out to me and asked if I wanted the bed, and she would sleep on the couch. I replied that I wanted the cat out of the bedroom, and she didn't respond.  
As much as I would love for the cat to be gone entirely, I am not asking that of her. I just want it out of the bedroom, so we can vacuum all the hair, and I can at least get some sleep. These allergies make me feel miserable, and I never want to be in the house during the day. Her solution is allergy medication. I personally think that is unreasonable because I would need to take it every day for years to come (the cat is young), and I don't feel like that is fair to ask of me. I think allergy medication is something that should be taken seasonally, or temporarily for certain situations, like visiting a relative who has a cat. I shouldn't have to take it every day just to maintain a better quality of life, because of a cat allergy.  
Am I being unreasonable? Seeking any advice on the best way to approach this situation. Fianc?e is very defensive about the cat.

This is because they often have petty drama and I think a lot of them are immature. The guys in the classroom find it funny but I think some of the girls feel insulted that I deliberately avoid them. Frankly I don't care, if I want to sit away from someone that is my business. I am entitled to my personal space. You wouldn't complain about someone sitting far away from you on a bus so why would you complain about someone sitting away from you in a classroom? If I don't want to sit by you that is my business. The teacher has no problem with me doing it.

Anyway so I go to take my seat in the class and a girl makes a lewd comment something along the lines of ""why you moving your chair away baby, i'll take care of you"". I responded by calling her a degenerate. I didn't think much of it but she seemed a bit upset by that. I am sorry if she felt that way. I don't dislike her as a person in fact she is quite a sweet friendly thing but I come to school to learn not to socialize much.  Should I say sorry to her?

One of my previous girlfriend's was abusive towards me and so I can be somewhat distrustful of women.

Main things to know:

1.  I broke up with my long distance boyfriend two weeks ago. We tried to make it work for months before it ended (together a little under a year, almost all long distance with visits every couple of months). We met a week before I moved for school, I felt a good connection (particularly compared to the 6+ months of mediocre dates I had been on), did long distance for 9 months, and after a couple months in the same city it was clear that he would never quite be what I was looking for. I cried on the day of the breakup and in the weeks leading up to it while we tried to ""fix things"", but have been feeling great ever since. Since we were long distance (mostly) and my ex's communication was poor, my life hasn't really changed.

2. I'm moving back to school in two days, a 4 hour and $150 trip away. I'm back home about once a month and only have a year left.

On to the infatuation part... I used to have a very cute, smart, and kind class friend in college. The kind of person who makes you feel safe and at ease right away. There was chemistry, but neither of us was single at the same time and it never went beyond class friends. Over the years since college we ran into each other at parties and on Facebook, had some nice interactions, but otherwise didn't speak. Last night we ran into each other at a mutual friends birthday. Both single for once. We ended up talking for two hours, and slept together.

Maybe it's because I just got out of an unsatisfying relationship or because I always had a bit of a crush on him in class, but I'm deep in infatuation. Haven't felt this way in years kind of butterflies. And he wants to take me on a date before I leave. Now, it might lead nowhere and that's fine... But if he's interested, I don't know if I'm ready to jump into the same thing that I did with my ex less than a month after ending things. Enjoying a new city is often easiest done single or dating locally. Why should I tie myself down after just getting free?

But this guy is a dime. He's only gotten more handsome in recent years, great job, empathetic, advocate for social justice, good social skills but introverted, etc.. This isn't just my own observations, but supported by our close mutual friend. If he has any interest in keeping in touch, I feel like I should take it.

&#x200B;

Quick background. My fiance and I have been together for almost 6 years and are getting married Spring 2020. We met because my brother was best friends with him and as my fiance came around we got to know each other and fell in love, started dating a year later. Throughout all of this my fiance and brother remained friends but they would fight every so often about different little things (they actually fight more than my fiance and I do). My mom also took in my fiance as a ""second son"" and just really being a people pleaser to him.

&#x200B;

More recently. About 5 months ago my brother and fiance went to dinner together as friends. My fiance had 3 beers with dinner at a regular restaurant and my brother said he felt like my fiance was choosing drinking over him and he was being used as a DD. My brother left my fiance with no notice at the restaurant and drove back to his apartment. My fiance then paid for the entire dinner and bought an uber home. However, this pissed my fiance OFF. He has a big thing with being abandoned which he felt like he was by my brother. So he cut my brother off.

&#x200B;

A month after the incident my mom gets involved and wants them to ""patch things up"" and return to being best buddies.  Mom also says she's mad at my fiance for going to far with punishing my brother and he needs to get over it and man up. Anyway, fiance and brother have a small talk and basically my fiance is done being his friend because they always fight over things like this and my fiance has pretty much outgrown my brother. 

&#x200B;

So today we are at a point where my fiance is not mad at my mom or brother, just neutral. He is fine going to family events and talking with them, but he no longer wants to be the over buddy family son. Basically, he just wants to have a normal family relationship where you get along and see each other but no longer rainbows and sunshine perfect world where everyone lives together type of thing. But NOW my mom is being persistent that he's being rude and an ass for not talking it out and basically going back to how it was a long time ago with best friends and being really close. Her main bother being that my brother would've been best man and now no longer is since that event.

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to do or how to get this fixed. Like I said my fiance is fine and not mad at anyone. But he just wants to be cordial and see them here and there, not everyday like it used to be. I don't know how to approach my mom to tell her to back off.

I found out he was waiting to dump me after we went to an event we had tickets for in a couple weeks. 
I am very sad because I still love him, but I realized how terrible I?ve been treated lately.  I would bring up how I felt unappreciated and taken for granted and he basically didn?t do anything with that. 
He put me down, belittled me and gaslighted me. So when I found out he was going to dump me, I took matters into my own hands and broke up with him this morning. 

He was so mean. Basically said ?yeah I?m not fucking into it. I want things to be fresh and exciting? 
I would do so much for him, surprise him with things, leave him love notes, etc. 
So I said ?you don?t want to work on the relationship? and he said ?this early on? There?s no point.?

306,WhatTheFuckSam,Dating,33,c715p0,70,"So some context. We've been dating for 10 months, met at a local church and we immediately clicked. We started becoming more and more intertwined into each other's lives (+1 at weddings, meeting parents, serve together at church, planned a 2-week trip together later this summer) and I've been head over heels for her since we started dating. Our relationship seems to be #goals when it's going great and at those moments I want to spend the rest of my life with her. When she's mad at me, it feels terrible, like I can't even breathe in our relationship and I'm constantly walking on glass to please her or make her not mad at me anymore.

I may/may not be the source of the problem in our relationship...well sorta. I have attention problems but it's more of an ""I can't multitask problem"". When I am working on something, I will finish it, then move onto the next thing. Multitasking just doesn't work for me and I've accepted that is a part of who I am. So sometimes, I'm cooking us dinner and she asks me something. I finish whatever I'm doing which takes 2-5 seconds, then I respond. To her, I am willfully ignoring her and she gets extremely mad at me. Our entire day together could be going great so far (went to watch a movie, picked up groceries to make a fancy dinner, played sports together, etc), but once that 2-5 second pause happens it all goes down the drain.

Some example of times she's gotten extremely upset because I took 2-5 seconds to respond or pointed something relevant out and tried going back to the conversation.  
\- We were in the subway with friends from out of state. While in conversation with her, I point out that we get off at the next stop because one of our friends look confused. She got mad at me because I was ignoring her when I was listening and could recite back everything she said.

\- We grabbed coffee/pastries from a fancy coffee shop and are walking to the movie theater to watch Avengers. She asks me something, and I don't know if she was finished asking the question, so I wait thinking there's a second part to the question. She gets mad at me because I wasn't paying attention to her and I ended up skipping the movies.

\-I work 9 to 5, so sometimes I get pulled into meetings or I'm suddenly unavailable (she also works 9 to 5). So one time I was messaging her during working hours, then got pulled into something that lasted a couple of hours with my boss and left her on read in messenger. I didn't think it was that big of a deal because I was seeing her after work anyway and it wasn't anything urgent. It was a big deal to her and she was upset with me the rest of the day until I apologized to her saying it was my fault.

I know I am partially at fault here, and I understand it's frustrating being ignored (she would go hours not talking to me to 'show me what it feels like to be ignored', even though it only took me 4 seconds to respond on more than one occasion) but I don't think I'm actually ignoring her. Maybe I am? Am I the asshole??

For the past few time we've spent time together, I tried extremely hard to not ""ignore"" her. Stop whatever I'm doing and respond immediately so she won't feel ignored and won't get mad at me. But after a few days of doing that, I feel so on edge. Like I'm constantly scared if I miss something she says or I don't respond fast enough, BAM I ignored her again and she's mad at me/won't talk to me anymore. I feel so scared that I upset her, that when she says, ""Babe"" when we're walking together and everything is going great, my first thought is ""what did I mess up this time?? I was so attentive to her, etc"" and then she says that she wants ice cream.

When things are going great, I honestly do what to be with her forever. She makes me feel loved, wanted, and she just gets me in a way other people don't. But I don't want to constantly feel scared that I messed up when I'm around her. Sometimes it feels like what she wants me to be is a servant that is at her call, and immediately drop everything to attend to her. I don't want to feel like that, I believe that we should be equal partners and should be treated as such. And I feel that yes, it's an issue that she feels ignored and I don't want her to feel like that so I understand why she gets mad. But I also think her response to my actions is a part of it too. She is extremely quick to anger while I've always forgiven her even for things that I deem as red flags (hitting me when she's upset). Recently she hit me because I was ignoring her again and didn't apologize because she felt justified in hitting me because I was ignoring her. I even asked for an apology and she said I'm not getting one because I deserve it for ignoring her.

Today, I woke up early to make us breakfast, went out to the grocery store and pick up some fresh fruit to make lemon-caramel apple filled crepes. While cooking everything, she asks me something while I'm squeezing the lemon into the caramel-apples (in a hella hot pan so I'm being careful to not burn myself). I respond in 3 seconds after I finish the task, and she gets super upset at me for ignoring her when I was just worried not to burn myself. She was so upset she didn't want to eat breakfast that took me an hour to make. That was a few hours ago. I just left her place and went back to mine, we'll see what happens.

But am I the asshole here? Am I actually ignoring her and am in the wrong? I don't want us to break up but I don't want us to continue like this.

Any advice for how we can get through this together or some other perspective that I'm missing would be greatly appreciated.

Problem is a few months ago I started getting involuntary thoughts and feelings of wanting other women. It got so bad I'd dream about being with other women. I thought it would go away but they didn't, so I came clean and communicated my issue to my girlfriend. It was hard, but it's not fair that I continue to act like everything is okay, not to her or me. I asked for a break and after talking for awhile she granted me one. I told her I would be talking to other girls and potentially more. I know this is weird but me and my girlfriend have a relationship where we are bluntly honest with each other. Problem is once I got the break I dont feel like pulling through with it anymore. I'm on tinder now talking to girls and it's super fun I wont lie, I might meet some of them. But when I think about my girlfriend, I just feel super horrible. What's your advice? We were each other's first and are high school sweethearts, and we have gotten to a point where we see each other almost every day. Maybe I just need space, but the thought of being with other women is very strong and not like before. If some of the advice could include things that we can work on collectively together and things I can do to get rid of these thoughts, thatd be great! Thanks for all the help!

my only issue is that we?ve been best friends for a long time now, but even though we?re dating, we still talk how we did when just friends and it makes me feel awkward if i were to try do anything like kiss her

we met up a day after i told her how i felt and it was literally just like when you meet up with friends, i?m not very confident so i didn?t really try do anything like hug or kiss because it would be weird to do it randomly and here comes the issue, we don?t have conversations where it would be normal to do this

will this solve itself after being with her for a while? this is my first relationship might i add, we?re both 17

310,darnellstevensonIII,Breakups,1,c70glx,1,"I am currently studying abroad in Europe, about 2 weeks into an 8 week program. My girlfriend and I began dating my senior year of high school/her junior year. We shared 3 years of a genuinely incredible relationship and ended up at the same college last year.

She had a turbulent freshman year of college while dealing with an anxiety disorder (being away from her family, other personal issues likely exacerbating this). About 3/4 of the way through the year she decided to leave school and go home. She told me this the night before leaving and I was blindsided. She thanked me for helping her while she was struggling, as I often cooked her meals and tried my best to make her comfortable at my house. She didn't want to breakup and believed that we could get through a period of long distance.

Selfishly, that night, I proposed that we break up for the time being. I was anticipating studying abroad and naively thought that we could just take a break to work on ourselves and then get back together when I get home. I regret this, immensely. In hindsight, I should've been completely supportive during this and assured her that we could get through it. Instead, I immaturely tried to protect myself from pain that wound up being inevitable.

We continued to talk after this and visited each other a few times. But as my departure for Europe got closer and it began to set in, our communication began to take a turn. She said that we both should take some space for ourselves, not to count on getting back together when I get home, and that I should focus on having fun this summer and being present in this experience.

We've been respecting each other's space and not communicating, but I miss her beyond words and have been persistently sad. I still love her deeply and can see a future with her, and I don't think this is because of the 'rose-tinted glasses'

In the mean time, I've been trying to work on myself. Meditating, working out, and embracing my emotions. I think one of my main flaws in our relationship was that I was often emotionally absent, and I'm trying to use this time to address that. I want to respect her space and allow us both to reflect/work on ourselves, but I don't want to jeopardize a potential future together by making her think that I've moved on.

She is an amazing woman that I was fortunate to have in my life.

Can any communication between us be beneficial? The online ""relationship gurus"" all suggest no-contact and to make her think that you are better off without her, but that strikes me as manipulative bullshit. How can I convey how I feel without pushing her further away?

I met my flatmate about 10 months ago and we hit it off from the beginning. Both of us where in the same department (different courses), had been allocated to the same flat and liked the same things. In these months we have experienced so many beautiful things and developed a relationship full of trust and support. He helped me thought my break up of a long distance relationship and I helped him with struggles of hard life choices and what to do in the future. We had countless dinners, movie nights, parties, study sessions, being with him really feels like family.

He is the person I trust the most right now, and I felt grateful and happy to have him in my life. The last couple weeks I had felt him very distant, I had keep pressing him about what was wrong but he wouldn?t bulge and would always say he was tired / upset about something else.

But yesterday he blurted out that for the past month he had developed strong feelings for me, and that he just needed to tell me just in case I felt the same. I felt all those months of trust and support come crashing down. 

I?m a very insecure person but I also know I?m very attractive. This is not the first time this year that a friend has asked me out / said they are interested in me and I?ve had to distance myself, sacrificing the friendship. I know the Business School environment can be very wild, and the ratio of girls to guys doesn?t help. With a high pressure environment, trips abroad and tons of alcohol involved, everyone seems to be looking to date / sleep with someone. 

I feel I?m loosing the person I trust the most here. He said he would distance himself, as I didn?t feel the same and pretending that nothing happen would still make him overthink every situation. We used to spend so much time together and I can now only think it was because he was interested in me romantically and not because he actually enjoyed my friendship. I thought I had made a friend for life, someone to keep in touch for the rest of my life, and I?m terribly sad that I need to let go.

I don't even know *why* but I just don't feel loved anymore. It's difficult to explain, but his touch doesn't feel like it's filled with love, we hardly ever have sex anymore (because ""he's tired""), and if we do he goes soft half-way in and blames it on a number of things (too hot, too tired, etc).

  


He's been feeling a bit depressed lately, so I'm willing to stick the blame on that for the lack of physical intimacy, but the overall feeling of ""not being loved"" I'm a bit more reluctant to blame on him being depressed.

  


I also want to be there for him in this, but because of this fear I have about us I find it hard to be strong enough to help him. I don't even know if I *can* help him. Whenever I ask he just tells me not to worry, and that he's fine, but I want to help.

  


All of this is just making me feel so sad and frustrated, I'm commited to this relationship and I definately don't want to call quits on it anytime soon. Just a month ago we were talking about how we could see a future where we could be married... And now I just feel so helpless. I don't even know how to bring this all up to him, because knowing him he'll just blame himself and be even more distant and down. I don't want him to feel like he's at fault for what I'm feeling, because that's not how I see it.

  


I don't know, I guess I just want advice from people who might know what I should do because I'm at a loss here, honestly. I feel so sad, frustrated, unattractive and so so lonely in this all and I just want some help.

I'm on mobile so formatting. 

Also you all might think this is obvious but my husband gets mad at me so often for this that I just don't know anymore and I'm majorly confused. 

My husband and I married young about 2 ? years ago after dating for just over a year. I noticed shortly after that we likely weren't overly compatible. We decided to do our best and work on our marriage and have been going to counseling to help us communicate better and to deal with my trust issues from being cheated on in past relationships a few times.

He's a gaming addict first and foremost. Sometimes he can be off for like a day but then he immediately gets stressed and snappy and has to play the next day. If he isn't gaming, he is on YouTube 24/7. We've fought about this so many times. 

Last night the same thing happened again. It was almost 5 and I asked if we could hang out tonight. He's been gaming every day and night for the last week. I figured it would be okay to spend some time together. It wasn't.

We decided he would play until 7:30. A good 2 ? hours. Then he would pick up some beer and we'd hang out, have a bath together, be couple-y, all that stuff. 

7:30 hits and he's still playing but finishing something up. I'm cool with that. He gets up to go. I start filling the tub. He comes back and starts playing again. 8:15 rolls around and I nervously ask him what's up. He says he needs to finish the boss level. I tell him we agreed to 7:30 and it's not okay to do this again. He shrugs. I ask him why. He says ""I don't really care. I told you I have to finish something."" I said I had the tub ready for the last while and the water would get cold. He tells me I can go off and take the bath by myself.

I went and cried the whole time. I ended up just going to the bedroom after. He never checked up on me, he never came to say goodnight. He slept on the couch and when he got up to leave this morning, he didn't even come into the bedroom. 

This happens often. I'm usually ignored, left alone, and honestly I know he probably doesn't want me. We have the same talk about it every time. Eventually after he gets angry, he'll apologize to me and say ""I'll work on it."" But it's the same thing every time.

319,Nirvanagood,[new],0,c6ztn9,1,"Thanks for helping me however you can. I'm going to ask my questions after telling the story.

First you need to know that there are four main people in this: me(16M), my best friend(16M), the girl I love(will call her A)(16F) and her best friend (will call her L)(16F).

From 5 to 8 years old I was friend with this girl(A) at school. From that moment I had not talked to her until recently. 

My best friend who is 16 years old knows me since 4-5 years. Recently me and many of my friends(including my best friend) started being friends with the girl I was friend with a few years ago. So we became friends for the past 3 months, the girl recently introduced us to her best friend. About a month ago we learned that (A) was in love with my best friend but he soon told her that he did not love. She accepted it and they stayed friends. 

About two weeks ago, we started having parties all together since school year was done. So my best friend started loving the girl I love's best friend. L and my best friend started loving each other recently. 

Now about the girl I love... I realize more and more how I love her since around three weeks. I talked to her a lot. She talked to me a lot about how she felt stressed and eveything because her best friend was with my best friend. She really doesn't want it to ruin her friendship with both of them. She told me that she did not love my best friend anymore and that she was not jealous but I believe that is not completely true seing how depressed she is recently. 

The girl I love just seems perfect  to me. The most impressing I realized is that I didn't fall in love with her because of her beauty but because of her personnality and how kind and intelligent she is. Since that moment I can't stop thinking about her. I told it to one of my other friends. I really can't know if she loves me too. We recently talked a lot about when we were young and both looked at pictures from our childhood. I only hugged her once one night at a party but for a few seconds. I went to sleep at her house with other friends yesterday. You need to know that she is very easily anxious about things. That night we all went outside to walk and me and one friend went away running from them(it was just a joke and I knew how to back to her house). So me and one friend in the streets for about 15 mins and they were searching for us. After some time they came back to her house and she was so shocked that she almost cried, we both came back to her feeling bad. I was then able to apologize to her and I believe she accepted my apologies. 

The other day I also went shopping with her and her best friend(two girls and me). I bought some clothes that they helped me choose. 

Another thing is that she is leaving in two days and yesterday was the last time I would see her for a while. She goes on a group trip for a bit more than a month, I find it really hard to not see her anymore for so long. I also don't want to stop talking to her during that time. 

The last thing is that next year all my friends go to different schools. Two of my friends go study in other town and the rest of them splits in two main schools. Of course I'm going to another school where none of them go, even the girl I love. I don't know how to interpret that but sur recently told me that she regretted not coming there too. So we are not going to be in the same school next year which means less chances of talking. At least her school is about ten minutes walk from where I will be, so hopefully we can stil meet sometimes.

I recently thought a lot and came very close to telling her that I'm in love with her. But I don't want to make her stress more or make her feelon't forced to love me.

Thanks if you read all that and sorry if it was hard to understand, I'm not normaly speaking english.

TL;DR  
I love a girl who a few weeks ago, love my best friend. She leaves soon for a month and I will not be at the same school as her next year. Please answer my questions or give me advice.

Now I have a few questions (any answer could help me):
-Should I completely forget the girl I love?
-Should I simply tell her my feelings? If so then should I wait for her to come back from her trip? 
-Is there any chance that she loves me?
-Should I ask one of my friends what to do?

320,commonholly,Non-Romantic,13,c6zmlp,4,"My brother has been unemployed essentially since he graduated high school a couple years ago. He tried working at a couple places, but nothing lasted for longer than a couple of months. He tried going to community college but failed out because he stopped going to class. He claimed that all of his classmates were idiots and assholes. 

&#x200B;

He showed interest in joining the military and even spoke to a recruiter but then when the drug test came around, my brother bailed. I also know that he has experimented with harder drugs like cocaine although I don't think he is addicted to them. He for sure is dependent on weed, though. When I go visit him, our entire conversations revolve around pot or alcohol, and the last time I saw him he got so high he was unable to speak to me. He does not see weed as an issue. I have smoked myself but stopped due to not knowing the consequences of weed on a developing brain. I don't visit very often, for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

I live alone a couple thousand miles away from him, am a college graduate and gainfully employed. He lives with our dad, which is how he is able to survive. I don't understand what I can do to help my brother's situation. Mostly I just try to avoid it. I invited him to come to where I am and live with me for a little bit just so he could get a change of pace with the condition that he got a job and paid his fair share of rent. Although he was initially open to that idea, he never ended up coming (now I am looking to move and am finding different roommates). 

&#x200B;

We didn't have a terrible childhood although our mother was an alcoholic who neglected us from the time he was about six and I was eight. She spent most of the day sleeping in bed. When she was not asleep she would fight with anyone who crossed her. I avoided her, mostly. To cope, my brother played video games all the time. I did tasks such as cook for him and drive him home from school. My dad worked full time and had a bout of unemployment. My parents fought a lot and eventually got divorced when I was in college and my brother still lived at home. I wanted to suggest to him to go see a therapist because that's what helped me cope with our childhood, but he's not interested in that idea.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I don't want to completely ignore him and write the situation off forever, but that seems what I might have to do given that I have no control over him and his life. It just feels bad to sit here and watch him fail, though. It's not like money would be an issue. My grandmother is loaded and would be able to pay for years of therapy for him out-of-pocket.

I?m 24 years old male, studying in university, living at my parents? house.

I?ve never had my own room, always sharing it with my little brother.

My parents are the happy, very loud. need-to-invade-your-space kind. They?re very nice to us, very helping and kind.

As I love to be alone, being for 5 mins in the same room as them, is very very exhausting for me. I feel like I have no rest.

My mother is the ?can?t waste time? kind, so when you?re chilling, reading a book, playing games, watching TV, doing nothing, she?ll always come to you and tell you to do stuff, or ask you about stuff you haven?t yet done and remind you that you must do this and that. She?s also very controlling, she must know everything, and everything must be her way. She even tells me when to go or not to sleep, and everytime I go out we always have an argument about what t-shirt I should wear. E.g. I?m wearing a t-shirt, she yells at me to wear the other one. I tell her to leave me be, she doesn?t.

I?m very happy when they go out and leave the home just for me and my brother. When they?re at home, they?re constantly asking us to do stuff, asking questions, speaking very loudly, and they?re in all rooms at the same time => impossible to avoid them.

They also feel like I don?t love them (which is wrong), and often make me feel guilty. 

For 4 consecutive summers I worked full time and couldn?t go with them on vacation. Best 4 summers in my life, simply because I was on my own for 2 weeks periods. I could simply sit, and listen to the silence. 

Now, that I have a part time job along with my studies, they didn?t even ask me, they just told me ?we?ve made the reservation for this date, and you?re going with us on vacation?. They know I hate going with them on vacation, not because I don?t love them, but because I love to be alone at home. They also go by car, the trip is 24h long. They know I hate long car trips. I really don?t wanna go. I feel like I?m choking. I feel like I don?t rest. I wanna cry. 

They insist that they?re extremely happy that I?m coming with them on vacation.

Me (F) and my SO (M) both almost 30. We have known each other since school. We are 14 years together.

We are not married. We do not live together. We exchanged the keys of our apartments a few years ago. We are both kinda lazy in our free time. We both work full time (8 hours / 5 days a week) with no real other obligations. So we have all the time after work, but we both play videogames pretty heavy. So we both enjoy time alone too. We see us most times 2 times or 3 a week at the moment (it was way more once). After about 2 years of relationship (both pretty young at the time) we split for 1 1/2 years. I met 2 other men in that time, but they turned out not as nice as him. He stayed alone all the time, telling me he just had one date (blind via net) that went kinda akward. He said he just wished it was me the whole time during the date. He is very shy - not the type to talk a lot. Of course I tell him he can be honest with me but he just does not like to share. If he does, his statements hurt me more often, especially in the last few months.

&#x200B;

He recently told me (in the midst of an intimate moment), when I was talking about our future, that one side of him wants to be with me to the end and the other wants to experiment ... with others. Of course, after that I did not feel like having sex anymore. The next time I mentioned that we have not had sex for some time now, he immediately recognized this but answered that he tried it that day but suddenly I did not feel like it anymore. Then I addressed that statement and he says it was not meant that way. He immediately thought that the statement was crap, but he does not apologize or anything like that. Such statements make me think he only holds me until a better one comes. I asked him, would he be more happy if we open up the relationship (even tho I dont want to and I would probably just game and be misserable knowing maybe he would bang some one), so he told me that he knows that, if we ever split, I would have admirers way faster than him and couldnt stand the thought of ""giving me away"" (kinda hurt too, cause sounds like I am a thing). But I did not argue anymore - it is at least good to know he thinks in some way about me. But I guess those statements made me pretty angry so this post is now here. 

&#x200B;

I've been trying for about 6 years to get my boyfriend to do something about it or show interest in taking the next step (moving in together). He hardly shows any. For the past 2 years, I have spoken more regularly about taking more steps in the relationship because I feel frustrated and unloved, sometimes lonely. I told him all of this. I open up, he does not after all this time. None of us likes the apartments we currently rent, but he decides to live alone there anyway. About 2 years ago, when I asked him why he wont, he explained that he was afraid of feeling directed by others too much when he will live with me. But I do not understand that, we are basically very harmonious with each other and no one makes regulations to the other one. Quarrels were rather rare. In recent months there has often been controversy due to the things I mention here. I admit I am ofter the start of fights in the last weeks but hear me out some more. In the last few months my boyfriend at least says more often that he wants to move together. But everything we discuss is often postponed or simply not done. His bed has been broken for months; I offered, we buy a new one, that we take with us later 50/50 - I showed him suggestions for beds. He rejected every single one and did not send me a single suggestion. 

&#x200B;

While I still make little surprises from time to time in the relationship, I have the feeling that I can never expect or receive such a thing from him. The last 3 of my birthdays were all pretty boring, he did not even tidy up or set a table for cake. It was a day like any other, except, there was cake and a new game. After I mentioned that I was disappointed, he said I should wait for the weekend (we always go out for dinner on the weekend after one of our birthdays). On that Saturday he arrived 3 hours late for the birthday of his girlfriend. Then he promises again that he will do something nice for me within the next week. This was almost a month ago tho. Today we had a date for me to visit him (to finally cook for me and make me have a great day!), because it is very hot right now, where I live and we both hate the summer, I said I dont want to go that far in the sun but I will to visit him. I asked what does he want to do today? Well he, like always, tells me the raw truth about ""not wanting to do anything today - So I can stay home... if I want"". I am very mad right now because it seems like he does not even care if I do something nice. It just kinda makes me sad, that he is not in the same mind like years ago and the state Iam in: That there is nothing greater to see your SO. 

&#x200B;

I used to cook 3 courses for him when he had his birthday or it was Christmas. I have, and I am not proud of this, on his last two birthdays done just as little as he has for my last 3, but at least I was on time and it was clean. When I told him again that I was disappointed with my whole day and I had been for the last 3 years, he started to complain that his 2 last birthdays were not any better. Sometimes I do things like get up on Saturdays, buy sandwiches and drive to him, bringing food to his bed. He does not do such things for me. I always have to ask what will we eat for dinner? Because he does never offer anything prepared. I buy the food, when I am in my place and I sometimes buy food at his place. He only buys food at my place when I tell him too bring some. We often order, because he did not think ahead even if he knows I will visit. Then I pay, next time he does and so one. But last time we ordered in my place or I let him pay for stuff was a long time ago. I am more often at his place tho (work is closer). But note that I do not care about money at all; I mean what else am I going to work for, then spending it for SO or family (or videogames lel)?  

&#x200B;

He says he does not know if he wants to marry me after 14 years because ""so many marriages will break in the end"". Nevertheless, he is the one who later wants me to give him a biological child in order to pass on his heritage, even though there are thousands of children without parents. He plans this in his mid-thirties. I am not ready to have a child so late in my life and have been telling him for years that I have no wishes for a child with the situation we are in (not living together, not married). And: ""He was rased in the tradition, that as a man he would be the one creating a family of his name"" Guys Iam no femist but that shit makes me crazy. My dad only has daughters so I want to keep my name and I dont want kids anyway. I find his stand a little bit outdated. A picture pops in mind, about me doing the cooking and the dishes while he is sleeping on the couch. 

&#x200B;

I admit that, I have not been the best girlfriend for the last few months too because I'm at the point where I think, why should I continue to work on something that goes nowhere further. I told him once, that work is more important than him, I told him I could do better when I was real mad. I told him, he should make a stand now or he will lose me. I always apologized immediately on my own when I said something bad. I never hold up to the things I say like: If we do not get a new bed in here, I will not sleep here any longer or sleep with you on this bed because I like my back. This has proven me it has no effect if I try to push that way. I do not want to be the girl that tells her man to do this and that - sometimes I get the feeling he is so disconnected with me... that I need to. 

&#x200B;

I am only trying to motivate him to move forward with me. But I am at my wits end. I was writing with him, he told me I am abusing him because I asked him, why he is not trying anymore if he knows ""I could have a new guy faster"" just as he had told me himself 2 days before. I know that this was not a nice thing to ask guys but he told me himself and he seems to be the one always getting away with just spitting the raw truth in my face (see statements above)? If he wants someone else, he is just keeping me in hoping someday he will find her. When I told him, ""I'll leave you if you do not move forward with me soon"" he told me again, I am the one abusing him for telling him that. Making pressure like that (pressure after 14 years, really? I am sorry but... what?). Well, I stoped doing it because he told me ""If you tell me one more time, you will leave me, I will just take it and move on from you, not even beeing friends anymore"". So I have to be careful what I say, so as not to hurt him, but he has been doing it for months now again and again. 

&#x200B;

Dont get me wrong, I love when we are together and he is super nice guy in any other regard. Please note he is always ready to help me out too in every other way if I just ask.  Maybe I'm just tired of being the one who plans everything, if we ever plan something. What do you guys think? Is he just to anti-social even for his SO? Does he not love me anymore? What should I do (what can I try)? He says he loves me. I generally believe him, but he too does not tell it often in the last weeks. He tells me, when I tell him. Am I just trying to change him into something and I cant see? Even tho I am the more outgoing person, I fear that I'll be the one that will be most sad after leaving him if I cant see a future where I have someone to lean on. I really do not want someone else but I would love to have a deeper connection with someone so I dont feel that lonely all the time.  I never pictured myself very romantic and thought for 10+ years that he was my soulmate. I do not think I am asking to much?

I have a large family with lots of cousins. We do a lot together and are pretty close. Most of the cousins are younger. 

There is a cousin, we?ll call him M, that is my age. All the cousins really like him and he?s honestly a good guy. 

Tickling is very common in our family with the young cousins. Last year, my cousin was tickling a younger cousin (7F) and started tickling around her legs and her private parts. He must have only done it for a second, then looked like he realized it was inappropriate and moved his hand away. 

I told him later that I noticed, and he said he?s not really sure why he put his hands there, but he moved them when he realized. I asked my younger cousin if he ever tickled her in her private parts, and she said no. 

I think it was a momentary lapse in judgment. And I haven?t seen anything close happen in the past year. In fact, I haven?t seen him tickle cousins at all any more. Should I tell my family this or should I give him the benefit of the doubt that he had a slip in judgment and realized it was inappropriate? 

If I tell my family, they?d freak out and label him as a child abuser and probably kick him out.

325,adviceplz1996,[new],5,c6z90c,0,"My GF and I have been together 1.5 years, I comforted her as she was still hung up on her ex boyfriend in the military. I guess we started out friends but one drunken night we fucked and after awhile we officially dated. This is important because it shows that we were not built on a solid foundation. Throughout the relationship she was financially dependent on me, she was very needy emotionally because of her past with depression and an abusive home. I managed her everyday life including making her psychiatry appointments and her spending. She said I was being controlling but otherwise she would have spent it all on drugs and alcohol. I actually did stop managing her spending and she had to borrow my money for rent because she had spent it all on drugs. 

The last 6 months of our relationship was really rocky because I cheated on her and lied about it for months. I told her immediately but I lied that it was only a kiss on the cheek, but in reality we made out. She became really obsessive about where I am and she kept bringing it up, I know I was the asshole and I took all the heat for it after she found out the actual truth. But after 6 months of both of us making break up threats we actually did. It was mutual, stemming from her resentment towards me and for me it was because I couldn?t take it anymore. I did not want to be her nanny anymore, she?s a grown woman. I?m not her bank. 

Right after the break up, she called me asking to meet up and I did, she said she wanted to change the break up to a temporary exclusive break. I agreed because I love her, and only if she managed to change (managing her money well, making her psych appointments herself) she agreed to this. 2 days after that, she said we should just get back together because she said that she would do it, but she wants me to accompany her through these errands I?ve made her do. I told her no, that we should just meet at the end of the week and she broke down crying. She said that I?m just being stubborn and I told her she needs to stop pressuring me to take her back and I need some space to think if we are compatible. 

I don?t know how to break up with her as I am afraid she might hurt herself or worse. She told me she took ketamine to deal with all the pain I caused her and I?m so guilty, I don?t know what to do.

After talking a lot, they had a date and got together near the end of 2018. I was and still am very happy for them, they get along very well. Since then, I became even closer to both of them, especially to her because I was already close to him.

She also talked to me about issues in their relationship, and I helped them, by talking to him, and giving them advices too.

However, I fear since a few months about having feelings for her. I absolutely do not want to be in a relationship with her, because I value our friendships, I picture them to be my life-long friends. Even if she was not with him, I would not risk my friendship with her for a relationship.

I doubted my feelings but I think I was in denial. Now it seems obvious to me for multiple reasons. We are on vacations so I won't see them until 2020, and I hope I will not feel the same then.

What can I do to stop this? I cannot stop talking to her because we're part of a group friend and I do not want to stop speaking to them, and it would be very suspicious.
Should I tell them? I fear it would ruin our friendships.

327,YourDrunkenStepdad,Infidelity,17,c6z2e7,34,"We broke up three weeks ago, shortly after our 7 month anniversary. She started a new job a few months ago. Ever since she started, I noticed a change in our relationship. She stopped initiating sex. She stopped posting pictures of us on social media. 

My friends who knew her always thought she was a liar. Even caught her in a few lies. She told me at the beginning of the relationship that she had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder after her last boyfriend moved out over night and ghosted her. Red flags, multiple. I was in love.

She told me she had gone out with a couple of the people she works with and one of them hit on her. She told me about it, I was a little miffed by the guy, but I was glad she told me. 

She started to pick fights. She said I wasn't communicating. I was going through a rough patch at work. She called me a lot of things, saying that I wasn't a people person and that I was depressed all the time and she wasn't making me happy. She said I didn't trust her, ""I never gave you a reason not to trust me"". 

I promised to work on what I could. I tried to be as communicative as I could. We were fine, but I felt like I was always walking on egg shells. Then it was her birthday, and I had taken my vacation time right around then. I spent a lot of money. I rented a car. I got train tickets.

The day before her birthday she wants to break up with me. I got another hotel room for the night. We didn't really talk. I gave her a birthday basket. She cried, I cried. We still cared about each other. 

The next day I decide to go on that vacation anyways. She and I are still texting. She texts me saying she misses me. I get the car and drive to pick her up. We have a night of great meals and conversation. We have sex. On the way home, I ask her what happens next. She says we'll see.

The next day we spend the day together. We get into a fight about her work, and then refers to that other guy. She starts distancing herself. I am in her neighborhood to go to yoga, so I offer to bring her coffee. She already ordered some. I ask to say hi, she gets weird. Her roommate is there, and she didn't tell the roommate that we were back together. I wait downstairs. She comes down. We start arguing. It's a weird situation, and I'm starting to get the feeling that she's hiding me from a) her roommate, or b) the guy who is in her room right now.

Later that Saturday, she dumps me over text message. On Sunday we were supposed to spend the day together. It's the last day of my vacation. A vacation spent trying to fix what is so clearly broken. That day she posts a picture on social media of him and her on a boat together at sunset. He posts a video of the two of them kissing. She doesn't respond to my texts. The next day I get my things from her apartment and block her from ever contacting me.

She gaslighted me. She said I was paranoid and insecure, while at the same time doing shady shit. I don't know for sure if she was cheating on me while we were in the relationship, but to have him all over your social media for the following three weeks... 

The relationship was fucked, and most of my friends knew that I was unhappy. I think the hardest part about all of this is the rejection. The rejection and the effort I put in to fix it, it all just makes me feel like an ass. She can distract herself with this guy, but I'm left to my own devices. I still have this sinking sadness. 

TL;dr: GF told me not to worry about new guy at work. Started to freeze me out, started picking fights. We break up. She starts dating the new guy at work a day after we break up. Pretty sure she was cheating the whole time.

328,f1234567890--,[new],13,c6yx53,14,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I have been together since we were 19. We have an amazing relationship and fit together perfectly in every way. We disagree sometimes but always resolve thinks quickly and amicably. We have lived together for 5 years. We are both quite introverted, although I am moreso, and are both young working professionals. I have a few close friends that I meet with regularly, but am not a social butterfly type at all. He tends to go out with a group of friends more and has some shared hobbies with them.

In regards to children, we have pretty much always leaned towards not having them. Maybe in the first year of our relationship, we would joke about what we would call our future children, or how we would raise them, but we were so young and the relationship was still in it's early stages, so this was more just a fun thing to think about rather than serious considerations. My partner has just never felt that instinct for parenthood, and I haven't either. When I have doubts about not having them, this is usually because I worry that what if I regret it in the future. I worry that I may lose my partner (I worry more about illness/death than him leaving me) and would end up old and alone (I know this is stupid and paranoid! I work in the medical profession so I think this might be why I worry about illness so much). When I've said these things in the past, my partner has pointed out that this is not a good reason to have kids as 1 - it's selfish to have children just so you'll have someone to talk to when you're old and lonely and 2 - things might not pan out that way, some children will not have close relationships with their parents for whatever reason, so I can't count on having my children around when I'm older. He thinks that if I worry about that sort of thing, I should try to make my life more fulfilled/make more social connections in other ways. I struggle with this because I'm not by nature a friendly/extroverted person, but I have been trying. The element of providing grandchildren for both our parents (who both live close by) also influences me, although I know that this is not the right reasons to have children so I try not to be influenced by this.

In the past, the discussions we have had about this have always concluded with ""probably not, but not ruled out entirely"". However, when we discussed it again yesterday, my partner said that, having recently seen friends have children and how much of a big impact they've had on their life, he feels that his decision not to have kids is now definite.

I found this quite hard to hear, and I'm having trouble working out why. I think it's similar to how people feel if they don't really want kids, but then are told they're infertile, or go through an early menopause etc - I think that the choice or possibility being taken away is what is hitting me hard rather than a burning desire to have kids. 

I am generally a worrier so part of me thinks that I am just creating problems where there isn't any. At the same time, this is the only proper adult relationship I've ever had, and I'm worried that this feeling of not being totally happy signifies that I've been led by him in my thoughts so far, and whether if I was with someone who really wanted kids, that my opinion may be different and I would be happy to have them.

I have thought about whether therapy would be a good idea to try to sort out my own thoughts. 

Sorry of this didn't make much sense or was rambly!

Honestly, I?m not even sure what kind of advice I?m looking for. I think a part of me just wants to rant and to have someone to talk to

I?ve been in a relationship since I was 18, now I?m 25 turning 26 soon, 8 years. My boyfriend and I just broke up after he cheated on me, I won?t go into details on that but lets just say it wasn?t the first or the second time he did it but I forgave him. It?s been about 2 months since we broke up and we still haven?t fully dealt with the logistics such as lease, moving my stuff out etc. When we first ?separated? we both agreed that some time apart would do us good, I packed a few necessities and went to my brother?s place, I haven?t seen my ex since then, we broke up over the phone. It wasn?t just a ?lets break up we?re done? thing, it happened over many conversations. Honestly, even though I was sad I wasn?t super super sad about it. I think it was because I was sensitized about it because he had cheated a few times over the course of our relationship so it was a bit of a ?yeah I saw it coming?.

A month ago I started getting close to this guy, he wasn?t a guy I just met, I?ve known him for years but we were never super close. We met over games and he also lived in a different state so we never met in person. When I started playing the game again as a distraction from my break up, I confined in him and he showed an immediate interest in me. Just talking to me a lot, asking me about my life, complimenting me etc etc. Honestly, it was never super obvious that he liked me, wasn?t really super flirty or said anything sexual. The company really helped kept me distracted from my break up and just kept me from feeling lonely in general. Just 2 nights ago he visited my state, he was just doing a really quick trip for work, we met, talked and hooked up, I left his hotel that night because I didn?t have any belongings with me and he was going home the next morning anyway. Long story short, because like I said, I wasn?t exactly sure how he felt about me I asked him about it straight out. I asked him ?what is this to you? Because I?m not really sure how you feel? and that I just wanted to manage my expectations with him. He told me he didn?t want to be with anyone right now. I was obviously, quite disappointed. I didn?t push for any more of an explanation than that, just said ""alright"" and that was it, just felt kindda saddened and weird. Why flirt with me for over a month to only tell me he didn?t want to be with anyone?

Anyway, now that is out of the way I feel, weird. I feel like I?m starting to get anxiety about being alone. It really just feels like? life is so quiet and different. I?ve spent the whole of my adult life in a relationship, I never imagined I'd be afraid of being alone until it actually happened. Friend suggested for me to use a dating app but I feel like it?s too out of my element. I really just want to meet a guy and feel some sort of connection right away but obviously I know I?m not in the right place to do it. Frankly speaking I don?t have a lot of friends right here as well, we?ve moved around a lot. I feel weird living with my brother, then probably having to move out soon to live by myself. How do I manage moving out? what should I take and what shouldn't I take lol, how do we deal with things we ""share"". I?m just.. nervous, lonely and not really sure what to do right now.

330,throwthisout640,[new],4,c6yuph,3,"I?ve been working in a grooming salon within a large pet store for the last year. Being in such a large store, we have multiple managers in charge of different departments. About 6 months ago, our store obtained a new manager for the live animal department. Despite the fact that this manager does not work in my department, he?s been quite attached to me since we?ve met. 

Even though my time is supposed to be spent in the salon, he continually asks for my help in the department he manages (on slow days, I?ve said yes and pitched in) and he has even offered me a job working under him and stated that he could get me into a management position if I took it. Furthermore, he?s very vocal about his appreciation towards me. He?s told me I?m perfect, that I?m the best, and that he?s happy to spend time with me. However, these conversations almost always happen outside the salon (on the sales floor) where my own manager/coworkers are not present. Up until a couple months ago, I?ve found his attitude endearing. He?s a nice guy and has never tried anything that I would constitute as harassment. 

But recently it seems that gossip is going throughout the salon, and I?m beginning to question his intentions. First, one of my coworkers told me that this manager had a crush on me. It was an innocent comment, which I laughed off. But then a month later, a different coworker told me that this manager is a pervert, who?s trying to get in my pants. Finally today, I had another coworker tell me to stay away from him because of how flirty he is.

This manager also doesn?t have the best rapport in the salon, which makes me question the validity of my coworkers? harsh comments. He?s a stickler for the rules, and isn?t afraid to call groomers out on safety violations. Because he technically doesn?t manage us (but still has the power to do so) most of the groomers strongly dislike him. When calling people out, he?s always done so in a joking way, so I?ve never been particularly bothered by it. If there?s ever an issue that he calls me on, we usually joke about it and all is forgiven. There was even a time where he lied to his boss to cover up a mistake I had made, which is something I?ve never seen management do for anyone. 

While I?m trying hard not to instigate this, I don?t want to cut myself off from this manager completely (and frankly, I can?t anyways). As I said, he?s a nice guy and our friendly banter often makes my day better. While I felt some favoritism at first, I didn?t feel like this manager was interested in me until hearing the comments my coworkers made. So I guess my question is this: does it appear that my boss is interested in me, and what should I do about this to avoid the scrutiny of my coworkers?

334,gamerwidowthrowaway,[new],15,c6yjbc,1,"TLDR since this is really long: my husband prioritizes his hobby over spending time in his marriage and it's eating me alive.

Throwaway because I think he knows my main.

Background: we have been married a year and half after 2.5 years of intermittent (and extremely hard) long distance due to his graduate school. He has been home 8 months due to parental losses on both our parts. 


Until a year ago he had this bar game that he only played occasionally. Last fall when we were in an LD period, we started having issues because he was suddenly playing this game 5-6 hours a day at a bar. I have a history with a bar hopping ex and I was not okay with this. It spiraled after a couple of months and we nearly broke up because he thought I was being controlling and I was losing my mind over it. 


We worked it out, but then things went sideways again because at the end of the LD instead of coming home he wanted to spend two weeks extra there playing this game and then go to a tournament for it. I was crushed. I hadn't seen him for ages and I wanted him to want to come home.  We fought, I said some things I'm not proud of. I'm not really sure how we didn't end it then. Frankly it changed the way I see him and our relationship. 


I've tried really hard to get over it, despite him going to another one of these events in the spring and practicing this game damn near full time all summer in preparation for another major tournament last weekend. This one I put my foot down and insisted I get to go - I haven't been on a real vacation in three years and it was at a major party city in a part of the country where I have never been. He was pretty sure I would be bored and didn't really want me to go, but I booked a tour for Saturday and we decided to give it a try. 


Sure as dirt, it didn't go well. Things were fine Friday and through Saturday night - I went on my tour which was awesome, hung out with him and his friends and watched him play a bit. Saturday night I was exhausted by 10 pm, and honestly had drunk a bit too much and asked him to come tuck me into bed (most married couples know what that means). After 20 min of swaying there waiting for him I gave up and went back to the room. Texted him something snarky and passed out. He didn't read the message for 3 hours and never really replied. 


The next morning I was still upset but it was his final day of the competition so I sucked it up and went down and supported him. He won, not first place but enough that it paid for the trip and then some (he also paid for my ticket there but everything else while we were there I paid for myself in terms of meals/drinks/tour etc). His made some crack to his friends about me getting the money anyway, at which point I was just done (I pay all the bills at home and was losing money on this trip). I left and tried my best to avoid him and sleep until it was time to go home since he was celebrating with his buddies, although I did again get hammered and send some kind of mean texts (again I am not proud of this behavior).


We didn't get a chance to really talk about it until a couple of days after we got home and we ""worked it out"" some since then but I still don't really feel right about it. I feel like I am jealous of a game and that is just straight up ridiculous for a married couple our age. I've been trying to get over it since the event is over, he has in fact picked up the books again, we spent some time together, were finally intimate, etc.


But then he tells me yesterday he is going today, all day, to another city to celebrate more with his friends and play this game again. I just can't even. He asked me if I had anything to say about it but what is there to say? It's clear he prioritizes this hobby over my one day a week I have off, over me, over this marriage. If I told him I didn't want to go he would anyway, and I'm not the type of person that tells another adult what to do. I don't know what to do. My anxiety is through the roof, we are looking at more LD in the near future and  the first time I feel like I don't care if he goes. I don't know if we can survive a separation with this attitude but I don't know how to get past it. Help.",1561812316.0,I think my husband (30sM) values his game over me (30sF),0.67
335,Throaway10010101,Relationships,10,c6yj60,0,"I guess maybe this sounds dumb to me, but I'm starting to feel guilty about being attracted to other women.
I love my girlfriend, I really do, but I'm starting to feel that it is because of her behavior.
Personally, I think it's completely normal to still find the opposite sex attractive while in a relationship. It doesn't mean I have to stare at them, stray away or cheat. I'm not actively looking for another partner, but It's not like I can just ""turn off"" my sexuality or something.
Things my girlfriend does/have said are starting to make me feel guilty about it however. 









&nbsp;
&nbsp;













To start, if I mention anything about a woman ""do you like her hair?"", it doesn't even have to be sexual, there is a chance she will say ""do you think she is more attractive than me?""
I can not tell you how much I hate that question. That question makes me so upset that it hurts. If I refuse to answer, she takes that as a yes. If I say no, I think you are prettier, she would probably say that I am lying. I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle when she asks that.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Even if the girl in question is ""prettier"", they aren't my girlfriend. They aren't the one I chose to be with, I made a commitment to you and put blinders on to any other possibility.
If I even dare say that a woman looks good, or she **THINKS** that I'm even talking about how a woman looks, she also gets sullen and sad. You can just see it in her face, she just acts like I've punched her in the gut.

&nbsp;

Like for example, there is a movie and the actor looks like they could be 21+ but they are playing the role of a younger person, and I say ""i wonder how old she is?"" She might say ""why, because you're wondering if she is over 18 and it's okay to be attracted to her?"" (I had a stint where I had real trouble struggling with an anxiety disorder, had a rough time where I thought I was a pedophile and wanted to kill myself)

&nbsp;

 I already gave up watching porn for her because If I didn't she would constantly get really upset if she found out I looked at it. It was a really hard thing to do because it really made ""me time"" much more exciting, now it's rather boring to be honest.

&nbsp;


I just feel really jaded about the whole situation. Yesterday we got in an argument over it and I told her that if the shoe was on the other foot what would she say I told her ""you can't sit here and tell me that there aren't guys you see every day who look better than me in some way."" It's just bullshit. I don't believe that I'm a gift from god and no other man compares to me. I'm just an average looking guy with an average body. I **personally** see guys everyday who I think look better than me, and I'm a straight guy. 

&nbsp;

The thing that hurt me the most was a few months ago when she told me ""if I could shut your eyes off so you can't see any other woman, I would. I really would.""  That statement really pissed me off and hurt me. It made me feel angry because, as rude as it may sound, does she think she is the queen of women, and only she is worthy of being appreciated? it also made me hurt, because It feels like she doesn't trust me.

&nbsp;


We have been together 4 years, and I just feel really upset. Do I sneak looks of women sometimes? Yeah, I do, mostly when I'm alone.  But I don't sit there and stare, and I try my best not to even look at women when I'm with my girlfriend. 

I would never cheat on her, I try to tell her how I appreciate her and care about her but I don't think it ever gets through. Is this something that everyone has to go through? Am I really the issue here, and I'm just crazy imagining that normal people don't even see other human beings as attractive when in a relationship?

he will not be able to. I've been trying to decide for years and Ive gone back and forth countless times. Posted this in the wedding subreddit, but I would really appreciate a lot of opinions as that community is significantly smaller. 

I'm between 3 people at the moment. I'll give a short synopsis of my reasons for each. Please leave your vote and/or reasons in comments, thank you :) I'll try to answer any questions asap. 

My mom (54F): If she hadn't done things when I was 18 and older that almost caused me to go no contact with her I would pick her automatically. The fact that she went through 2 divorces when I was a child didn't matter to me as much as what happened when I was 18. (If you want the details you'll find it on my profile from the Narcissitic parent reddit). Things are good now though and she's still my mom and I still love her.

My mom and her boyfriend Bob (50s M): I've know Bob since I was 5. He's been a friend of the family for that long and I think he's a great person. He makes my mom a better person honestly. I just dont know if he's the right ""fit"" for how I imagined my wedding day would go. Also not sure if it would be weird for a bride to have 2 people to walk her down the aisle. 

My Uncle (50sM): He is my dad's oldest brother. He's been a huge support to me after my dad died and been a role model to me most of my life. He's the textbook definition of someone that ""pulled themselves up by their bootstraps"". He was the trustee to my dad's life insurance money and always had my best interest at heart, he gave me full control of the account a few years ago. The only main negative is that my mom might be pissed/ upset I didn't pick her. My uncle is also not the warmest person and comes off a bit cold. I think it would still mean a lot to him if I asked though. 


TLDR: Mom would have been default if she didn't do a shit thing for years that almost made me go no contact. Her BF is a good person and has been in my life since I was 5. Uncle has always been there for me, but mom may be pissed if I dont pick her.",1561811534.0,Who should I (24F) ask to walk me down the aisle? (ages and relationships below),0.63

They found the messages between me and the guy (43) I've been seeing. Yesterday after I came back home from an exam, they read them out loud to me. Even the explicit ones, where we talked about sexual acts. They definitely wanted to embarrass me so congrats, they succeeded.

I feel fucking mortified.

They didn't know about my sexuality, though they've been bullying me about not having interest in girls since high school. I live with them through my nursing school because I can't work full time to support myself. My dad's begging me to break up with my boyfriend because he's going to have a panic attack otherwise. ""Don't you care about your parents? You're getting locked here and not going anywhere until we can see you've deleted that man off Facebook.""

338,Marsevans,[new],234,c6y8xz,477,"Hey reddit, I (25 F) recently found out that my husband (37 M) has been lying to me about some of his habits that I told him were dealbreakers for me when we were dating.

A little backstory, my husband and I have been married for almost a year now and we are about to have our first baby after much struggle with fertility. When we were dating, I found out about six months in that he was a heavy pot user and drank excessively. At this point, we weren't super committed, just having fun with each other, so I sat him down and told him that while I did like him, the pot and alcohol were dealbreakers for me and that we should go our separate ways because I didn't think it would work out. I said that because I have my own trauma with weed and users, and I've come to learn that it isn't something I can deal with/ learn to accept in my partner. I suggested we break up as it wouldn't turn out to be a good match. He then teared up and told me he loved me and would do anything to keep me around, saying that he would quit the pot and only drink moderately. I was very hesitant but he eventually convinced me he only smoked for fun and there was no dependancy issue, therefore making it a very simple and easy thing for him to let go of. Needless to say, I stayed with him. We were living in different parts of town which were pretty far away and working full time so there was no way we met up often enough or for enough time that I was able to ensure that he did/didn't give up the pot. Anyways, things go well aside with us aside from the fact that my family did not want me dating him (he comes from a different financial background than me. Not that it mattered to me) and opposed us vehemently. A year passed and he proposes to me. I accept and my family cuts me off. We get married after another year and now start living together. I notice bits and pieces of weed and weed stuff around the house but he claims they're from years ago. I find packets of shatter and glass pipe in our bedroom. I ask him politely if he still uses and he declines every time, making me feel bad for asking, saying how could I accuse him of such a thing. Me, being the idiot that I am, I trust him. Then yesterday, he sends me a text message by accident of his weed order which was supposed to go to his dealer.
I sat him down and confronted him. I didn't want to believe it at all and he kept denying until I showed him the message. He finally fesses up to everything and reveals he has kept up with his habit. I feel awful that he could lie to me like that, right to my face without batting an eye. I asked why he has put me in this situation when I am now pregnant, cut off from my family, and having to deal with his lies. He then proceeds to tell me it's my fault. That the stress surrounding my family's disapproval of him, of finding a place together, and just the general stress of adjusting to live together made it the only way he could relieve himself. To a certain extent, I could understand needing a stress reliever. But these past few months have not been easy for me either. I have been dealing with everything he has plus the pregnancy. He said everything was my fault and he couldn't be blamed for lying to me. I felt like I did my due diligence by telling him it was a dealbreaker all throughout the time we were dating. The weed and the lies repulse me to no end and I want to leave him but the baby and the prospect of having no family support is stopping me. I love him still, but my past with weed and users has been far too traumatic (he knows all the gory details) for me to deal with all this again. What should I do? Pick up the courage to leave, or will something fix this for the both of us?

340,DLBARB09,[new],3,c6xz65,0,"I wrote out the longest story for you guys to read about my relationship/breakup of 7 years with so many ironies and full circle moments that have just left me broken. I would love to get it all off my chest if somebody is interested in reading it but I decided to make a shorter one because I just want somebody to talk to and I feel lonely and depressed. 

Basically I (M27) met my ex (M25) in 2011 in university in Kentucky. He was the most attractive person I have ever met in my life but his nerdy personality is what made me fall in love. Of course he was closeted and I was the first guy to pursue him. So insert two years of chasing him and completely neglecting the life that I had planned for myself including internships, friends, etc. I was on call to him and he knew it. 

I would sit in the library for hours at night just to have the chance to walk him home once he got done studying. I would find out little facts about him and plan dates accordingly. Found out he loved card games so I rented a room on campus and decorated it like a casino and had a card night with him. Found out he loved The Italian Job so I drove to 5 movie stores to find it so we could watch. Found out he liked comedy so for our first official date 2 years in I took him to a comedy show after a fancy dinner. Had to slide the bouncer $50 because he wasn?t 21. You name it and I did it because I was/am so in love with him. 

My city isn?t big on Marketing/Advertising but I knew I didn?t want to leave him so I accepted a Marketing job for $25,000 out of college to gain experience even though I had good offers in other cities. He was still in school so I couldn?t chance it. Of course that covered only like 1/2 of my bills so I ended up $7000 in debt so that I could stay in the city with him. I ended up quitting and taking up serving to catch up on bills and my student loans. Well of course I couldn?t find a decent paying job in the city at all so I kept with the serving. With this I was able to pay for many surprise date nights with him. Surprise him with concert tickets, theme nights at home, his favorite meals when he got home, etc. There is nothing in this world that makes me happier than making him happy. 

He was an accountant (started 2016) from which included a lot of stressed out nights and me bearing the brunt of it. His foul moods and sometimes physically not being able to get out of bed because his job requires so much. I spent so much time working to do little things to cheer him up while the whole time I was dying to get my career started. So I figured at his two year point I could ask about transferring so I could find a job. Well naturally he gets so stressed with accounting that he transfers to HR at his company in mid 2017. And just like that I was sitting there once again having to bite the bullet so he could gain experience at the company as a recruiter now. 

Finally at the end of 2017 I asked what he thought of me moving to Toronto because I had always wanted to live there. We visited there the year before and it is ridiculous how much they have there compared to our city. So many more companies and opportunities. I had wanted to live there since I was a kid. So we talk about it some more and he agrees to me going and him potentially moving up there a few months after I go. I loved it up there but I made sure to let him know how much I loved and missed him. This isn?t the first time we had been away from each other. The first two summers of university he goes back to his city and refused to speak to me because he didn?t want to admit to being gay. Then his third summer he goes to Italy to study abroad. So while I am up there I keep pressuring him about coming and he says he is thinking about it. In the mean time I am finally getting interviews which I hadn?t had in years in our city. And then, I get the big break. I meet a rich lawyer and he gets my resume looked at and I am getting interviews with big corporations like Nike which I have wanted to work for since I was a kid. He visits me twice, I visit our city once and we talk every single day for hours via text/call/FaceTime. I got to Toronto in May and in August I told him that he didn?t have to come to Toronto but I would appreciate living in a bigger city so we both could have a job, he can transfer to pretty much any city. I told him I needed to know by December. Well we had a small fight at the end of December and he breaks up with me because he thought I wouldn?t come back. I was devastated because he was my whole life. Of course I blow up his phone trying to apologize but he had deleted my pics from IG and would rarely text me back. 

So the next month I just pack all my stuff up and head back to our city for good to win him back. I begged, pleaded and everything but he told me that this was best for us because we had been together our whole adult life and he needed to find himself and explore life without me. He told me that he has changed and grown in the time I was away and he wasn?t sure if I was meant to be in his future but ?if it were meant to be, it will be?. He told me he fell out of love and was just telling me he loved me while I was away to see if he would believe it himself. So now here I am almost 60 days NC later just sitting here on my couch broken typing this out. The things he has said to me the last 6 months make me feel like a shell of a person as he is out here posting on IG almost everyday (he never did this before) living his best life. If it weren?t for these dogs then I would never get off the couch outside of work. Oh and those full circle/ironic moments? Here you go:

The guy who was so confused about being gay to the point where he would run away, ignore and scold me? Well now his whole Life and IG seems to revolve around the LGBT life and showing it off. The same guy who just last year made me leave our apartment so that his mom would be more comfortable being there. The same guy who didn?t tell me about his company dinner because he didn?t want being gay to affect his career trajectory. 

He never liked sleeping around and now he goes to different cities when he travels and hooks up with guys. Adds them on IG and unfollows them so his follower ratio seems high. 

I?ve wanted to live in Toronto and work for Nike since I was a kid. I gave both of them up for him with no way to go back now. 

His friends who would never text him to hang out while he was with me? Now they are always having dinner and gassing him up.

342,Lookinforadvicec,Non-Romantic,9,c6xub9,8,"So, I'm usually not the dramatic type but here I go.  


I should start by saying that I'm quite distant with people, I moved around a lot as a kid so other than my 3 closest friends (that remained my friends for the last 12 years despite all the moving around), I tend to keep to myself. I'm still quite social and meet people easily but it's always very casual and on the surface, people that I'm always ready to say goodbye to.

However, about 2,5 years ago, I met these 2 girls. They were both a couple years older than me, I thought they were really smart and career oriented. I admired them for many of their qualities and talking to them always felt really good.  We started meeting each other every day to either study or workout together and it was always very pleasant. 

I felt instantly connected to them and they made me part of their group, inviting me to hangout with their longtime friends and family. One of them specifically had become the older sister I never had and she treated me like a little sister as well. At least that's what I thought... 

The ""falling out"" started a couple weeks ago on my birthday. They both knew it was my birthday, but neither contacted me. Normally, I would hardly ever notice because I don't celebrate my birthday and the reason for that is that my birthday is also the date anniversary of my brother's passing. I really loved my brother and it's a very difficult day for me that I just rather spend with my parents watching movies. To be honest, I don't expect much from my friends in general, but at least a ""how are you"" on that day would do...  


So, since I was already in a dramatic state of mind, I started thinking of all the invites I got and all the time we spent together and somehow I noticed a very important detail. Everytime we met, it was because they needed something/somebody. They needed a hug, they needed to vent, they needed somebody to tag along... and I was always that person for them... but that's not how friendship works. The day before my birthday, I was working and they knew that because I told them I'd be very busy and couldn't go study with them. But in the morning, one of them texted me about a family emergency she had that left her feeling very stressed. So I asked her if she wanted me to come over and she said yes, so I left to be there for my friend who needed a shoulder to cry on. And I didn't feel like I'm earning any friendship points in that moment because that's what friends do... but apparently that's not true... because I don't remember any time when either of them was there for me when I had a hard time, and on my birthday it just became more obvious.  


Four days after my birthday, one of them casually sent a picture of a book she was reading on our group chat expecting us to compliment her for reading... I ignored the text since it's a groupchat and it wouldn't seem too rude and I haven't received a single text since.... because they are probably doing just fine... am I being overdramatic?

343,Yburgrebnesor,[new],69,c6xs0r,162,"About two months ago I started looking for an apartment for when I graduated from college. It didn't seem like there were a lot of options in my area and I was kind of giving up hope when I found my current place.

It's a quirky three bedroom, two bathroom apartment, and it's a little pricier than I wanted but it's in a really nice part of the city and there's a great view from the living room. When I came by to check it out, I was nicely surprised to find two really friendly people, a nice gay guy (24m) and the young woman I mention in the title, that it seemed like I could get along great with. Another thing was the girl whose room I'd be taking wouldn't be moving out until the 24th, two and a half weeks after I'd be getting out of school.

Thinking the apartment was worth it though (they also let me keep a good amount of my things at the apartment in the meantime), I put down my deposit and hunkered down at a hostel to wait it out.

This last Monday I finally moved in and everything has been great. Then this afternoon my roommate @ed me in our group chat saying ""Hey Yburgrebnesor, from mid July my boyfriend will move in with me, I hope it?s okay with you, we have our own bathroom but we will share the kitchen so hope it?s okay with you.""

I was really surprised since there was a whole month that I could have been told about this. My immediate feeling because of this was anger but I tried not to let it influence my response. I responded ""I?m really surprised you?re only telling me this now since you?ve known I was going to move in for some time. I think we should have an in person meeting to talk about all the details.""

I think talking about a big thing like this over text is really inappropriate and could lead to a lot of miscommunication and other potential issues, so I really just want to meet in person to talk about it.

She then said she thought she mentioned it when I first checked out the apartment, but I was specifically taking notes that day of all the details of the apartment and would have written it down, it's definitely something I would have talked more with her about had I really understood what she said.

We make plans to meet, but in between texts about scheduling she's saying things like ""Do you have a problem with this??"" ""It sounds like you have a problem :)"" I didn't really respond to those messages since I really only want to talk about things in person. Our other roommate has also messaged me apologizing that this news was given over text, and told me that she had an experience with previous roommates at this apartment who were quite hateful towards her and her boyfriend when he stayed here for a few nights, on top of English not being her first language which is why the wording seems a little strange.

Though I'm a little wigged out by the situation, he's only going to be living here for a week before they go on a month long trip so at least by then I'll have more time mentally to get used to the idea.

During our meeting I'm thinking I really just want to know whether or not I'll get to meet him before he moves in, I want to confirm that utilities will be split four ways now, and I think I should ask for the rent to change honestly. I came into this apartment at a certain price thinking I had two roommates, to learn that I'll soon have three and might be paying the same price seems unfair since we'll be sharing the kitchen, living room, and laundry washer (we don't have a dryer so we just hang clothes up).

Is this an appropriate ask given the circumstances? And what else should I be covering during this meeting in terms of personal space and sharing the apartment equally? I've heard so many bad things from friends who have had couples as roommates in the past and just want to avoid all the mess that could come from that.

344,plmo767,[new],9,c6xp44,16,"Hey,

I (23M) have been seeing by girlfriend (22F) for 4 months now.

Before dating me, she had a casual FWB (friends with benefits) situation with someone (22M), at least that's what she used to tell me. They've been friends since elementary school and still meet regularly. Let's call my girlfriend Laura and him Paul.

&#x200B;

We are all living in a small to medium sized town, so there is some overlap in our social circles.

This week I ran into someone I haven't seen in a while and during our conversation it became clear, that she was under the impression that Paul is Laura's ex-boyfriend.

&#x200B;

I asked my girlfriend what that was about and she started acting weird, trying to avoid the topic etc. When I got more assertive about it, she finally admitted that things might have been not as casual as she made it seem.

She had deeper feelings for Paul, hoping that he would ask her for something more. When she decided to make the first step, he rejected her.

She then wanted to continue their FWB agreement, but he ended things regardless, because he didn't want to keep her hopes up.

&#x200B;

When I asked her if she still had feelings for Paul, she became quiet at first. Her reply was ""I... I don't know. I've always liked him more than other friends. I'm not sure. It's different now"".

I continued to ask her, what she would do if he wanted to date her right now. She again took her time to reply, stating that she would decline, because she's happy with me now.

So if I was out of the picture, you would date him? I never got an answer, she just looked at the floor quietly. Guess that's all I need to know about that.

&#x200B;

She obviously still has feelings for him and I'm not sure what she would do, if she was in a position to choose.

I've thought about the times we've talked about the topic in the past and while she technically hasn't lied to me, I definitely feel betrayed.

&#x200B;

She wants to continue their friendship and I don't want to force her to stop being friends with someone she has known for most of her life, but I don't feel comfortable about them spending time with each other.

I don't accuse her of cheating or anything like that, it's just highly uncomfortable and somewhat humiliating.

&#x200B;

I love her and really want to be with her, but there is a part of me considering to walk away.

I just don't know how to continue from here.

346,Anonymizer7173,Relationships,11,c6xgxm,15," I am seeking advice from anyone in the aviation industry. My wife and I have been married for about an year now. She is a international cabin crew with differing routes across the EMEA region. Now one of the  biggest issues in our marriage thus far is her sleeping schedule and lack of productivity. 

To summarize, she would often sleep 12-16 hours at home after a long haul flight from the destination she just came from. I understand the job is mentally and physically exhausting, not to mention jetlag from all the different timezones. A good sleep is much needed after her shift. The issue stems from the time at home after she wakes up. She claims she is still mentally and physically exhausted to do much of anything such as unpacking, house chores, laundry, and time spent together outdoors. To her, she feels she is entitled to her version of ""do-nothing"" (social media) day. This leads to frustration on my part where as I will be the one taking care of the household chores, any tasks for the family, taking care of our cat and so forth.... 

She states this is perfectly normal among most cabin crews and they need to rest and sleep a lot ( which I understand, I try not to disturb her when she is actually sleeping). My problem is the productivity afterwards. So my questions are to anyone that dealt and is a spouse of anyone in the aviation industry:

Is this normal? Or more of a personality trait rather than the profession?

If it is normal, how do you guys cope with their of lack of productivity or am I seeing it in a different way? 

Any advice ? 

Thanks all

We've known each other for 6 years (study in the same faculty) and for the last 2/3 months we have gotten really close, like hanging out together more and texting a lot. We have a lot in common and get along really well. Yesterday we went on our second date, we got something to eat and then hung out at a local park. It was all going very smooth, we were holding hands at times, no awkward moments or anything like that, like i said we get along really great. Later she drove me home and before i left the car we kissed, just a little peck. I think she was a little stunted tbh. We are both shy people.

We've been living together already for two years.

We just moved houses and it feels like I'm constantly with my foot on the gas while his foot is on the brakes. Quite a lot still needs to happen in our house, but I feel like I'm arranging everything: the painting, the furniture, hanging stuff, appliances, the moving itself. If something is done, it is usually because he gave in to my multiple requests to look at something together. He doesn't find things 'a priority' and only does a small unnecessary ""project"" that he then doesn't finish for weeks. He's decided that he wants to do a big part as a project with his dad, but has not made plans with him to actually start work on this project. It's now been six weeks and no dates have been planned. He sighs/rolls eyes when I ask him about it.

He works four days a week, but the other three days, he's hungover/tired/has plans already/wants to read/doesn't feel like it. This while I'm constantly on my phone comparing prices of this and that, making Pinterest boards for our new home and sending messages to second hand furniture ads. Although I'm still a (graduate) student and more flexible than he is, I'm currently writing my thesis and having quite a difficult time with family. I do all of these things for our place together and still manage to plan days away with friends and dinners. I was just so excited that *we* would be making our own place together and now I feel like I'm constantly nagging. I've told him that I would not be trying to bring things around the house up so often if he would just take a little more initiative to get things done with me, but nothing has changed. When we discuss things concerning the house, he gets annoyed that I approach him about it at ""this"" time (literally any time seems inconvenient to him) and he sighs and shrugs a lot when we do discuss things. Meanwhile, we live in an unfinished house.

I'll be done with my study in a year so when im done with my study we want to get married. We've already talked about it a lot, and i cannot imagine myself getting married with another man. I was skeptical about marriage, but with this guy, i want to spend the rest of my life with him.


My mom is a very conservative Asian woman. She was going to kick me out of the house when i first told her i was going to visit my boyfriend in his country when we first started dating. She doesnt like him because his parents are divorced so she thinks he doesnt know what love is, and also cuz he doesnt have any diploma. But he is the most hard working person i know. He is very passionate about his job and work and everyone loves him at his work. And i think thats the most important thing.



I am very close to my boyfriend's family. His mom treats me like her child and i sometimes go out and hang out with his brother. He calls me sister. Im already part of their family.

But in my family, its even a taboo to talk about my boyfriend. And i cannot even imagine telling them that we are going to move in. When i tell her about how im going to visit him, she just panics and tells me how sad she is and how dissappointed she is in me. She tells me that im irresponsible, cuz i am so young and im already in a committed relationship when i have to study and build my career like my friends. She always tells me she spent her youth to raise me, so i should not marry early. She basically just guilt trips me for loving someone very much.


She will freak out and have a panic attack if i tell her we will live together so i asked my boyfriend what he thinks about getting seperate houses to just show them we dont live together. My boyfriend wasnt happy about it at first but he said if thats what it takes, he is willing to do so. But he also said that i have to face them and show them my frustration and tell them how i feel.

350,FluffyBear28,Non-Romantic,4,c6x8lz,1,"I am kind of lost right now. Both me and my friend have been best friends since 2014, however things start changing since early this year and we eventually fought and stop contacting each other from this year end of march.

It was only until recently, a few days ago, both of us start talking to each other. Nothing much though, it all started out when I just simply send her a well wishes text as she is visiting Spain. Considering the fact that we have known each other for almost 6 years and we were so closed back then. I don't want to see any of my friends getting into trouble in overseas.

&#x200B;

She said honestly she don't want us to part our ways and actually wanted a reconciliation with me. Not that I don't want either, but rather I am scared. We were on a 3 months break from contacting each other.

&#x200B;

Previously we argued due to many things not in common. For example, she is more of an outdoor/sporty type of person, whereas I prefer indoor activities such as shopping or caf?-hopping. She is also more  of a tomboy, whereas I am kind of in the middle but more towards the girly side. Hence, there's not much activities both of us can do together. She find shopping rather dull and boring. One of the major factor that leads to our break in friendship is perhaps communication. We used to be in same school and same class back in secondary school. However, each of us went to different pathways right after we graduate. She is not used to texting. Whereas for me, I feel that since we are best friends, you know we should at least keep in contact.

&#x200B;

Frankly speaking, It's always me the one who take the first step. I text her first, I ask her out, I apologise whenever there's argument. And its really getting tiring. I want her to participate as well. It takes two hands to make a friendship work. Previously she gave me false hope and keep forgetting the promises she made to me. When its her birthday, I would put in the extra effort of giving her surprise and presents. However when its mine birthday, nothing. She will only apologise if I confront her about it. She didn't put much effort into our friendship.

&#x200B;

I do admit that I am at fault as well. I tend to get angry over small things but that is something am currently working on. I forgave her and am willing to give a second go for our friendship. But a part of me do feel scared as to what if she did the same thing to me again? What if it makes the both of us cry and stress again? Previously when we stop talking, it was hard for me; I remembered I cried for days and drank coffee for the day. PS: This year is quite important to me as it's my college application year.

Neither parent is willing to take in our pets so we are forced to rehome all 3 of them. We have less than 3 months left before we have to move. I am extremely bitter and resentful. **


He and I have been married for 6 years, before that we dated for 3 years. He is my high school sweetheart.. We have one child, a 5 year old who is the joy of my life. 

My husband is active duty military but is getting out of military in 3 months. 3 years ago, before he joined the army, he worked at a company his family owned but was unhappy and unmotivated with his work. There were days he would call off saying he was sick but would blow off the day playing games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends. 

During this time I had two jobs but still, money was tight especially with my husband calling off when he felt like it. There were months we were late on rent and were barely making it. When he decided he wanted to quit his job and join the military, I was very upset and afraid. He told me he felt that it was his calling and that we would be taken care of so I went along with it because I wanted him to be happy and it seemed to make sense. We broke our lease, I quit my jobs and I moved back in with my parents while he went to basic training. We ended up getting stationed at a very small, remote military base and my husband is gone 2 weeks out of the month for training. He has never been deployed.  I don?t know what he expected to be doing but he apparently hates the reality of his service and refuses to consider re-enlisting. 

During our time living on the military base, I went back to school and got my bachelors degree. I have not worked because there are no jobs aside from minimum wage part time jobs and the cost of child care would  end up costing more than half of my pay. I dedicated my time to school, raising our child, and maintaining our home.

When my husband told me that he would not be re-enlisting I felt lost. When he told me that his plan was to go back to working for his families business, I became extremely frustrated. I have already given up everything for him when he decided the military was ?his calling? and now he wants to go back to exactly what he was doing before. What is worse is that we are in NO way financially prepared to go back to civilian life. Our option is for us to both move back in with our parents for 1 year while he works so we can save up enough to buy a home. Doing this means we will have to rehome all 3 of our pets because neither of are parents are willing to take them in. This fact is destroying me as I am deeply attached to my pets, they are a part of me.

I am at the point where I can hardly speak to him without it turning into a fight. I am so anxious about the future and hurting all the time, I?m trying to rehome our pets and he has done nothing to help me. He spends nearly 100% of his free time playing games on the computer with his friends. There is more resentment than love at this point. 

What holds me back from leaving him is that despite all this I do love him. Something about him just draws me in and I care for him deeply. I have invested nearly 10 years of my life with him. He is the only man I have ever been with. I also worry what a divorce will do to us and our child. I?m afraid my husband will not handle a divorce with maturity for the sake of our child.

I finally quit, great decision but for a while I was really uncertain how things will work out with a new job. I instantly started to freelance just to get some income, and while I was working on one project, I had to briefly coordinate with a representative from an institution that would have been a good fit for me. 

That's how I met Clara, we just worked together a bit for 2 days or so (without too much interaction) but it seemed we got along very well. Some time after, I sent her my CV in case there was a vacancy in her company. She replied right away and told me she was so glad I got in touch, I have a great experience, right now they didn't have any openings but she would love to recommend me in the future... and then she said she would love to meet me for a chat. 

After that we texted a little because I said I'd like to meet, and the whole conversation was definitely casual. Keeping in mind she isn't HR or anything and it's a big company, I had no huge expectations, I saw this as networking which might come useful at some point. But she was always so enthusiastic with me, I was a little unsure if meeting her for a coffee was ok, considering it's not like I was meeting her for a job interview. 

I mentioned this to my contact who got me the freelancing thing in the first place (we are friendly at this point), and he told me that when I was freelancing, Clara asked him if I was single. My contact said I was married. I took this as both a good and a bad sign, clearly she was kind of interested but at least she knew I was not single. 


I went to meet her and it was definitely not a work related meeting. She did talk about her company and how she personally feels sick of it, and she definitely did give me some insiders tips relevant to my field which can justify this. But then it was all more of a casual thing, and we ended up talking about all kinds of things because our tastes clicked a lot. I threw in my wife in the conversation just to make sure I'm being appropriate. 

After that she kept getting in touch (not obsessively or anything), inviting me to industry relevant but casual events, or just sharing something with me that I could be interested in. She wanted to meet again, and at this point I felt like it would be really crossing a line, and at the same time telling her ""I am with someone, I shouldn't talk to you"" sounds idiotic and presumptuous.

It's an awkward thing to pretend it's all cool but keep turning down the offers to meet. I also don't want to get  bad reputation in her company. I don't really know how to appropriately turn this off.

355,Ccaves0127,Non-Romantic,3,c6wxki,3,"Hey there guys, genuinely confused here. I'll try to keep this short. 


So I met this girl just over a year ago. I work in film and I met her through that, we're both actors and I directed her in a film. Anyways during the production of the film I knew she was an exceptionally nice person. During the editing process, though, we became closer friends, to the point of talking at least once every couple weeks, more often than not we would talk once every two or three days. We talk about our acting/film-making careers, various relationship issues, mental health issues, just a lot of life stuff. I don't have many friends and she's one of the only people I feel I can talk to about this stuff. She moved to LA. After the film, she enjoyed it so much that we wrote a short series of videos together and shot those as well. 


Then, on June 14th, she stopped responding. No, that's not accurate. She stopped reading my messages. We mostly message on facebook, and you know how you can see when someone's looked at your messages? So the last few messages I've sent she hasn't even looked at. But she's still posting on facebook every day, and I see that she's online every day, or close to it, so I know it's not that she's just not on. Although she hasn't been commenting as much on posts. I also texted her """"Hey, haven't heard from you in a week, is everything going okay?"" No response. 


I'm just hurt because I don't have anyone else I really talk about my problems to and it feels like I've been abandoned, or that she doesn't even care enough to say ""This is why I'm not talking right now"". She's an exceptionally nice person, like I said, I know she's probably busy or she's dealing with some personal stuff or SOME sort of legitimate reason, she's not just blowing me off. But I wish she would at least say ""I'll get back to you in a few weeks. Something's come up"" Or something. I know this is really selfish and everything but I'm just at a loss I guess. Any ideas?

356,Valkyrie099,[new],1,c6wx9y,2,"Hi! I'd like to be given an objective opinion if anyone is interested in reading all that!
I met a guy via a video game (really cringe I know). He is in Northern Europe and I am in South - East. We hit it off, was really interesting to get to know each other. I had just come of a series of failed 1,5 year long relationships so I thought this would be a good way for me to work on myself in the alone time. 
    That was 2 years ago.... We met asap, things were awesome and all expectations were not only answered but even more. I am a medical student (intern in a few months, finishing my 5th year rn). Around exams and so on, we always managed to meet every 2 months for 8 full days. Everything has been amazing, no trust issues, no doubts for cheating. We ocasionally fight for only one reason.. Its literally only one. The text communication is obviously important, but some days it limits to an only 3 minutes of texting. We use Snap ofc but I have said that it doesnt replace the need of actual talking. Am I being unreasonable and needy for wanting more attention than 3 minute a day sometimes? He has tried to work on it, but I'd say out of 7 days a week, 3 will go like that. He says he has nothing more to say.. I try to get it but it's hard. 
     He isn't working to be busy. He is waiting for the results for a specialty he applied for, so he is playing games in the majority of time. He no longer says sweet things or compliments often, or seems too interested . Is that cuz of the passing 2 years thing or what? I have never had a relationship last more than 2 years so I don't know. The plan was for me to move to his country to work as a doctor after I graduate which is in a year now... 

Is that what a relationship becomes after it progresses? More steady but not as exciting, not giving as much attention? Its not a normal relationship of course so I wanted to hear your thoughts. Thank you to all who made the effort to read ?

357,throwaway26102,[new],11,c6wt94,16,"My brother is a really nice guy and my sister has been pretty mean to him recently and it?s been getting a lot worse. She?s been calling him names and pushing him around and giving him wedgies and wet willies. She also picks on him for being weaker and shorter than her, and any time he tries to fight back, she twists his arm behind his back until he admits she?s stronger and she?s the boss. She claims that she?s just messing around with him but both he and I have told her that he doesn?t see it that way and he doesn?t like it. And her justification for it is that she?s toughening him up because she thinks he?s too much of a ?pansy? because he?s kinda skinny and prefers to play video games rather than play sports or go outside. 

Our parents went on a vacation for the summer and left a little over a week ago and won?t be back until late July, and while they?re gone our sister is in charge. And since they have left the bullying has gotten even worse. She?s having him do all of the chores (I do half of them because that?s not fair at all) and she?s only let him go out once so far even though he?s asked multiple times. 

We?ve talked to our parents many times about how she picks on him and treats him, and they say that he?s old enough to stand up for himself and that he needs to learn how to stick up for himself. And they also think our sister is an angel who cannot ever possibly do anything wrong. They?re so proud of her since she gets straight A?s and plays volleyball and she acts like such a goody two shoes when they?re around. We?ve called them three times so far because of how she?s been treating him since they left and each time they?ve been more annoyed, and they tell us to work things out ourselves, and to listen to her since she?s in charge.

She doesn?t pick on him nearly as much or as badly when I?m around him, so I?ve been trying to stay with him as much as I can ever since they left. But when she says something to him while I?m around and I tell her to back off and leave him alone she starts picking on him for having to have his little sister protect him. But even still it?s better than when they?re alone because sometimes she keeps making fun of him until he cries because she knows how to hurt him.

What can I do about this? How can I help him? I don?t want his summer to be ruined by her being super strict on him and picking on him too. And I?m afraid to leave him alone with her because when I?m not there he gets a lot more scared and she?s way meaner to him. How can I fix this situation?

359,TallCricket,[new],2,c6wq2q,2,"My dad has what can only be described as a bad temper. He doesn't tend to start arguments, but if anyone else has what could be considered a ' debate', especially myself and my mother, he has to storm in and scream over it until it's over. When he gets in this mood it doesn't really matter what reason you show him, he won't listen, he'll just repeat the same incorrect thing over and over again at increasing volumes, often trying to bring up past grievances as a weapon of attack.

He doesn't do this often. But its gotten to the point that I basically just avoid discussing anything that has potential conflict involved to avoid this side of him and I more or less can't speak to my mother about anything he may disagree with when he's in the house. Even if we have a reasonable conversation that she doesn't want him involve in, he will still be on the look out to get involved.

How frequent he does this is random, sometimes 6 months will pass, sometimes it will happen back to back weeks. 

When I was younger (aka in my teens) I admit I was very difficult and often started many of his fights, so back then I could understand him going off. But now I consider myself rather reasoned and calm, so there is no basis for them. 

I find myself increasingly unable to move past his outbursts. I've tried discussing them with him, which of course does not work, he defends his behaviour, and just over the last couple of years especially I find in general I've just stopped talking to him. We exchange pleasantries and politeness when we have to, but there is no relationship there. My mother of late has noticed this and has been actively encouraging me to be more involved wth him, she doesn't seem to see his outbursts as that big of an issue as he is 'otherwise a good caring man'.

I talked to him about it, and he told me he just likes her as a friend. Lately, she told him that she crushed on him, and he rejected her. Let me make it clear that she is not pursuing me in any way right now, we're just friendly with each other. This post is me trying to plan ahead because I usually make terrible choices if I suddenly get confronted with a situation that I haven't thought through. She's certainly still crushing on my brother, the ""used to"" in the title is referring to this hypothetical situation sometime in the future. Sorry if that was misleading.

Point is, I like her, and while I'd also like just being friends with her, I could definitely imagine dating her. I also think there's a realistic chance that she will start developing interest in me, because my brother and I look very similar and also are quite similar in character (needless to say we do have some differences, but I think you get the point). So that's why I'm making this post. Do you think there would be a realistic chance of a successful relationship given these circumstances, or is it just weird to be the ""second choice"" after your brother?

The most fusterating part is I'm not bad at talking to people. I know how to be an engaged listener and when to take charge to say things about myself. For some reason people say I'm quite charming.

I've been playing guitar for 12 years, having been in countless rock bands, jazz ensembles, pop groups, etc. I've written my own music, recorded albums, done countless gigs.

Music is a huge passion of mine, and while I work in programming full-time, if a career in music ever became viable (small chance I know), I'd jump on it for sure. 

My best friend, however, is being delusional. I've known the guy for 10 years, and we bonded over other stuff like Boy Scouts. but four months ago, he started teaching himself piano and singing, and he's pretty bad. He got all excited and wanted to start a band with me, but I told him that him thinking he's at the same level as me is delusional and insulting to my experience. I said he's just not that good and playing with him as an equal wouldn't work out, but if he's serious about music, and he practices and improves in a few years, I'd definitely be open to jamming with him. But right now, me playing with him as his current level would be a waste of my time.

He said that he is ready, and that I'm just being a pretentious educated elitist asshole who thinks I'm better just because I got formal lessons. That's not it at all.

366,1stpostisathrowaway,[new],5,c6w82d,2,"I have never posted to Reddit before, so please forgive mistakes on my behalf.  I will do my best to correct them when notified.

&#x200B;

I found out my (28M) mother (55F) had been cheating on my step-father (56M) nearly a year ago and I never told him.  Unfortunately, my family has been in shambles for the entirety of my life (this is why I live nearly 1000 miles away now) and the past year has been no exception, as such I felt it was never appropriate to broach the subject.  

&#x200B;

Some background, let us start with my mother. My mother is a severe alcoholic and gambling addict that is completely dependent on my step-father.  She has been struggling with major depressive disorder for the majority of my life and is almost constantly on the edge of attempting suicide. She will generally make an attempt twice a year, with some attempts more severe than others.  The longer time goes on, the further the distance between us grows, a scenario that breaks my heart as she was my hero early on.  She acknowledges that she has severe problems, commonly seeks treatment, yet refuses to stop drinking and gambling away all of my step-fathers money.  

&#x200B;

Now for my step-father.  My step-father is my real father as far as I am concerned, with him first entering my family when I was 5 (23 years ago).  We generally did not get along until I matured around age 19, as I was an extremely difficult child/teenager. After I left for college, we grew extremely close and I do not think there is anyone on this planet that I care for more, as of right now. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few months before Christmas 2018, struggled like hell since then, and has now seemingly won his arduous battle (no more post-op complications). My step-father makes good money at nearly $120k a year, yet struggles financially as he refuses to separate his finances from my mothers. I have seen my mother spend thousands of dollars on slot machines in a single night. 

&#x200B;

Tonight I receive a phone call from my sister (34F), an individual with which I do not get along and an individual that makes my mother look like a saint.  When my sister contacts me I know there are three possible reasons as to why: 1) My mother has recently attempted suicide and is in a mental health hospital 2) My sister is incredibly drunk and wants to tell me how difficult her life is and 3) Both 1 and 2. She informs me that our mother has cervical cancer, has had it for months now, is refusing to get treatment as she wants to die, is cheating on my step-father, and is going to leave my step-father and move to another state to live with a friend. My sister also tells me how all of this is making her life so much more difficult. Well, at least she wasn't intoxicated.

&#x200B;

I have known for quite some time that my mother has been cheating on my step-father as she accidentally told my ex-girlfriend in a drunken rant, but I did not know she had cancer and was refusing to get treated. As far as her refusal of seeking cancer treatment, I am confident in my ability to talk to her about her options and the decisions she is making.  She is a grown woman, albeit mentally unhealthy, and I will respect her choices as long as I ensure she is well informed of the consequences. Cancer is a terribly slow and painful death, just ask my step-father.

&#x200B;

My concern here is that which is posted in the title. My step-father is a great man that has given me opportunities I would have never had otherwise. There was a time in my life I could have ended up some junkie loser and instead I am a few years away from a Ph.D. with an extremely bright future because of his guidance, because he was the only one that cared about some punk kid who did nothing but cause trouble.  Now, I am ashamed of myself for not telling him what my mother was doing behind his back while he paid for her belongings and her food, while he was fighting a cancer that could have very well ended his life, while he continued to be supportive of my mother as she resumed her depressive destruction despite his circumstances.

&#x200B;

I did not tell him because I knew if he turned his back on her, she would be alone.  I do not want to take care of her, my sister does not want to take care of her, and she has no one else. At my richest moments I can barely rub two pennies together, I have had many nights through my academic career where I have struggled to eat, I have had to walk miles in the snow because I couldn't afford to repair my car, all while she gambled everything away. She is my mother, but I do not feel entitled to take care of her because of the decisions she has made.

&#x200B;

I am going to see my family a week from today.  At this time I will discuss things over with my mother to the best of my ability, but if she refuses to tell my step-father everything, then I will. Here are my questions for all of you. How will I look this man in the face when he asks me how long I have known? What should I say when he asks me why I didn't tell him earlier? What will I do with a mother that has no where left to go? I consider myself to be a very cold person now and yet, I do not think I will be able to turn my back on her like I feel I should.

My question is should I just forget that she ever existed? Is it wrong I still think she?s just being naive? How the fuck do couples ever come back after a break up? Do they stay close or disappear?

The first date went really well and we ended up holding hands while we walked around and kissed goodbye. The last date we even made out a little.

TL:DR I (20M) started seeing somebody (20F) I met online and it's going well. How should I consider DTR moving forward?

Now she's on the cruise and gets back shortly and I'm looking forward to seeing her again but I'd love to hear some opinions on how the Reddit community has likes to DTR.

She's acknowledged the fact that she uses her phone a lot, and usually once she gets off her phone she can be more affectionate towards me.

TL;DR: due to mental health reasons I have to move back in with my pack rat parents who refuse to help themselves get rid or bed bugs.

2 years ago I moved out on my own. I mostly moved because there was no room for me in my parent's apartment. They also took advantage of me financially and it felt like they were holding me back. 

My parents are also pack rats. I wont call them hoarders but they definately like their things and hold onto a lot of unnecessary items. For example: when we moved into the apartment 6 years ago, my uncle said he wanted encyclopedias that we had. My parents still have the encyclopedias in a box for the next time he comes over. Which he hasn't done and they havent discussed the encyclopedias with him. I told them to give them to goodwill but they always snap and say to keep them for him. 

This is how they are with 90% of items. And thus I became a pack rat by default because I never really learned to let things go. When I moved on my own I realized I didnt need a lot of material possessions and it was mentally easier for me not to. I cleaned for a half hour daily and took a lot of pride in my tidy home.

About 2 months after I moved out, my parents told me they had bed bugs. They bought a spray that ""kills bed bugs on contact"" and sprayed all 2 oz of it throughout the apartment. When I told them they need to do more they said they have it under control. 

During this time I was supporting my boyfriend who was having a tough time. I was already depressed but seeing him so sad as well as a depressing work environment didnt help. However he got on his feet, got a good job, found his own place, pulled himself together mentally and grew from the experience. I was happy for him but my mental state was the worst it had ever been. 

This past January I had a complete breakdown. I had a couple of suicidal breaks before but nothing like this. I was hospitalized 3 times over the course of 6 months and didnt (still dont) have the mental capability to go to work. I am losing my place and I need to leave by Sunday. My parents were sweet enough to let me move back in but they never truly addressed the bedbugs. They now spray alcohol on seats before they sit down to ensure they are ""safe"". 

My mother casually mentioned getting a storage unit for all of her clothes the other day. I first asked her why she needs a storage unit. She said that she has clothes that she cant wear because she has a uniform at work. I told her that if she wants to wear something after work she can. I also told her about my 1 year rule:if it hasn't been used in a year you dont need it. She scoffed at that. I told her that she needs to wash everything in hot water and dry it at the highest setting and bag it before she brings it there. She thinks I'm being neurotic. 

My boyfriend has asked me to house sit while he visits his sister in LA. I have been sleeping at his place for a few nights because my electricity has been shut off. I am scared that I'm going to give him bed bugs and that we wont be able to see much of each other because of my fear of giving them to him. I'm also concerned about my mental health as I already know if I try to clean and get things in order I will get backlash. 

My father is also a very anxious/depressed person. He constantly puts a positive mindset down, he puts people who live differently than him down. He constantly insists that he is a horrible person and is generally a complete joy murderer. I told him I was super excited to start to sing again publically (I was a pretty good singer in the past but stopped because of my mental state). He completely shut it down and said that I was too old and no one would want to listen to me. 

I am so scared that I am going to slip back to where I was. I am a super tidy person now and I dont function well without order. Also, even though I was depressed and sunken in my own place, I at least felt free to be myself. And of course bed bugs. I dont want to live with them. It disgusts me and will be embarrassing. I dont want to have to live with the bugs until I move out so I can get rid of them in a new place. I dont know what to do. Can someone please give some sort of advice?

When we met, he said he loved to spend his time outdoors, backpacking, surfing, hiking, SUPing. I love those things too, and we did a lot of that early in our relationship and it was great. But now it feels like he's settling or changing and it wasn't what I expected. In the last 6 months, we've hardly done any of the outdoor adventuring our relationship is built on. On other relationship fronts, we haven't said we love each other, we don't talk about moving in together. I \[35F\] want kids (and early in our relationship he said he did too) and I just want to figure out if this relationship if going somewhere or not. If so, great, if not, I want out to find someone who wants what I want.

Then tonight, a Friday night, I was at the grocery around 8:00 pm by myself (because he didn't want to hang out).

We chatted a bit more and I brought up as casually as I could that I'm seeing someone (so that he'd get the message that I'm not interested). But there was a split second there where it made me feel really good to be asked out on a date.

My current bf doesn't do that, I feel like it's always me making or trying to make plans. I want to be with someone who wants to be with me and that's not how it feels now. I'm a very independent person, so I usually just hang out with my friends (he never joins) or make my own fun (e.g. hikes or cycling on my own or with a club) and in some ways it's been awesome to have so much time to focus on my friends and myself and cycling. I think maybe if I felt like the relationship were moving forward, I would actually really like the balance of time together v time apart we have, but the feeling that we're not going anywhere after this long is frustrating.

My platonic relationships on the other hand, boy do some get raw with business partners who act like shits, adult lodgers in my house who end up being consummate brats, employees who end up being immature brats... Maybe there's a theme here... Maybe I have poor judgement, maybe I just won't suffer fools. 


I really can't stand people who shirk responsibility, dump their problems on others without thought, refuse to communicate about issues, avoid avoid avoid, or go behind my back etc. I'm extremely patient and give people a lot of warnings and aim for instant, clear, firm, but friendly feedback when something isn't right and hold onto friends and colleagues who do the same like gold. But I find a lot of people in my life just refuse to get it and ride out my patience. Then we somehow cross the Rubicon and I simply don't care about them and their personal issues any longer (I've found there are always personal issues at play here), then I just have no time for them. All favours I did them, leeway and slack I gave them, all costs I absorbed myself in good faith; the debts all become due. When the faith is gone I lose all interest in them or their well-being and simply want them out of my work and life. 


Now I do often wonder if I'm too harsh or strict and check in with bystanders that I'm giving adequate feedback and warnings, and yes, I am, quite generously so I'm told, so I don't have any trouble sleeping at night. But I do wonder... What's it like to be one of these people with such a big heart that no one is ever a lost cause? Someone who might say warm-fuzzies-inducing things about our shared humanity and everyone being valued etc. It's just not me though, I don't buy it. I'll tell people in no uncertain terms to get out of my house and take their possessions (this after verbal and written warnings). They might be sobbing or frantically apologising (but too little too late), and I don't feel a shred of guilt, just elation and relief. Onlookers without context would probably think I'm being mean, a jerk, an arsehole, i.e. I'd be the one to look bad. I'd say in summary that my relationships can deteriorate suddenly, and that puzzles me somewhat and bothers me that I let things escalate like this, but I feel I eventually have no choice but to be blunt as hell when the messages just aren't getting through.

My father is Sri Lankan and the only sport he really watches is Cricket, growing up I always watched it with him and we rooted for the Sri Lankan team. No one else in our family is into sports at all so he was happy that I loved sports so much and he had someone to watch Cricket with. However as I grew older I kind of just lost interest in Cricket because none of my friends really even knew what it was and I just became interested in the sports that were popular where I lived, I would always watch major games with other people.

Right now the Cricket World Cup is on and my dad had been dropping hints all week that he would like for me to watch it with him but I didn't realize because I was quite busy and I kind of just brushed of what he said. He didn't really want to bother me because he knew I had a lot going on but he would just subtly tell me that dates when Sri Lanka were playing and would say something like ""I bought the channel that airs it and all the matches are available"".

Today I saw a post on Reddit about something that happened at the Cricket World Cup and Sri Lanka was the team that was playing and it just hit me that my dad wanted me to watch the games with him. He probably ended up watching all the games by himself too because nobody else would have been interested enough to watch it.

As a result, my brother who is 7 years older,  purchased a townhome, which I reside in and pay rent every month. My longtime girlfriend and I work opposite shifts of each other in our job fields so naturally I tend to feel alone often. As well, my brother has Asperger?s and isn?t always the most social being. I am an avid runner and I run everyday as it?s my outlet and passion but it?s just me running with myself. While I love it, it does not fill the social wellness void my mind needs.  So, I bought a kitten 3 months ago and he (Ollie) has been a great fit. However, he?s full of energy and due to my work hours being during the day, he?s hyper to no end when I get home and he will play for a long time with no end. Knowing cats live a better quality of life when in pairs, I considered buying another. My g/f and I talked of getting a kitten that she could pick out and she works very hard, is my best friend, and I thought it would be great idea. She earned her graduate degree recently and I thought this would be a great companion for her as well as for Ollie. Therefore, we brought Maddie home 2 weeks ago. Her and Ollie didn?t get along right away and we had to keep them isolated the 1st week. Now they are getting along really well with no issues. This is irrelevant to the issue though.

Yesterday I spoke to my Mom and Dad. I am close with them so we talk frequently. While I knew my mom didn?t think it was a good idea to buy Ollie, I did anyway. I?m an adult and I have one life. It?s important to be selfish sometimes. However, she really didn?t like the idea of me buying another kitten but I did. And during yesterday?s conversation I told her about Maddie and she wasn?t happy. If anything, I found her words to be quite irrational but maybe I?m wrong. That?s why I?m posting here. Upon telling her, she assured me that it was not a smart choice. She assumed that I didn?t clean up after the cats when in reality, I tend to their litter box and clean their food&water bowls everyday. I told my mom that I?m not a little kid anymore, that I hate messes, and clean up after myself and now these kittens. My parents are mildly allergic to cats but as long as households with cats are clean and tended to, they can tolerate it as if it?s non-existent. In disagreement, she told me that her and my Dad would have to stay at a hotel in the future when they visit us instead of staying here as they previously do. I love my parents but I can?t agree with my Mom?s reaction. In her eyes, she thinks I?m still immature and that purchasing these kittens is proof I haven?t grown up. I can usually place myself in others shoes and understand their opinions but this is a situation where I cannot understand. I live in this household indefinitely, 52 weeks every year. My parents visit for 2-3 weeks a year. I don?t see her rationale here. It doesn?t seem right that I should have withheld buying and caring for these kittens who bring so much joy to mine and my girlfriend?s lives. All so my parents can stay here a couple of weeks out of the year, which they can. They are mildly allergic and I?ve never really even seen it be a bother to them.

We get take out and go to the movies every so often but my girlfriend thinks this is sufficient. I plan the majority of the dates, and have done so for a large portion of our relationship. I just want her to take the time to plan a nice day. Even if it's just getting sushi and walking along the pier, instead of being on our phones at home.


3 months ago a co-worker of hers was leaving the company, so she planned a whole weekend where the team went out for drinks, went to an island off the coast, and general sight seeing.


How do I bring this up? I don't want her to plan something I've suggested to make me happy, when it's more about the effort than the activity. Last year we had an argument about this, and I feel like I'm going in circles....


More info: we normally sit at home during our free time. She reads books and watches movies, I'll play video games. I suggest going for a swim or a hike, she says she's too busy (she works a lot, and granted probably just wants to just stay home and do nothing)

381,Awesomeali1,[new],26,c6vc0u,27,"So for almost two and a half years, I \[M\] have been dating a white American girl. We started dating during my last semester of high school and continued dating through college. We have just finished our sophomore years. We go to school about an hour apart from each other, so it was never hard to make our relationship work since we could see each other pretty easily. 

I am Pakistani and my parents are very strict Muslims and cultural Pakistanis. Family is more important than anything, and my parents think Americans and their values only serve to corrupt the ones they instilled in their children. Needless to say, my parents do not know we're dating. But this summer she is at her university and I am at home with my family (about 500 miles apart). Since I can't justify a trip to a random city (my parents track my phone, so they'd know where I'd go), I can't see her over the summer at all. In order to save our relationship for the long term, I told my girlfriend I won't be able to see her this summer, and I'll see her when I go back to college.

However, this was the straw that broke the camel's back for her because she's gotten frustrated and tired of me making so many excuses and sequestering her to a small, hidden part of my life that's covered in lies. While she means a lot to me, to the broader world, for 2.5 years, she doesn't even exist. And it's not hard to imagine the pain that can cause someone. 

So, I'm at a crossroads. I either end the pain this is causing and we break up or I tell my parents and fight for this relationship (a fight that would be long and stressful and has a small chance of my parents accepting this). And I don't know which is more viable. I don't want to break up nor do I want to tell my parents. Pakistanis don't really date to date, so I would have to tell my parents I plan on marrying her, and that's terrifying since we're only 20. So, could I get any advice here?

382,anonymousllamar,Personal issues,13,c6vatr,17,"My SO [32M] and I have been together for 2 years, have lived together for 1.5 years, and are in it for the long-haul. He made it clear when we started dating that one day he'd want to take care of his mother, which is totally okay with me. She was a single mom and worked hard to raise him well. He and I are doing well for ourselves career-wise, while she has always made about minimum wage.

Our plan for her has been to purchase a multi-unit property and have her live rent-free in one of the units, while rent from the other units pays the expenses. Right now we have saved up a lot for this plan, but we are not yet ready to pull the trigger. Last year, he told his mom we plan to buy our property some time in 2019, emphasizing that it would be later in the year. 

She lives on the other side of the country, in a cold-weather climate, while we live in a very hot state (summers here suck, bad time to move). In April, she decided, against both of our advice, to list her house so she could retire and move down to our state, knowing that we have not bought a property and aren't even actively searching at this point. My SO made it clear to her that she will have to rent an apartment until we move forward with our plan, and she understands that. Her house sold within days, and she made an agreement with the buyer that she would stay in the house through the end of June. 

So, here we are at the end of June. My SO is currently road-tripping in a U-Haul with her to move her down here. She does not have an apartment lined up. Any of our efforts to get her to take definitive action on renting a place have gone nowhere. We've spent hours looking for apartments she can live in within her limited means with her golden retriever. She's got a very lackadaisical attitude toward the whole thing, saying that it'll all work out because things have always worked out before. She's been sending us apartment listings for places out of her budget and it's clear she didn't do any market research before deciding to sell her house to move across the country. While my SO and I have the means to help supplement rent for an apartment for her, we do not want to do this as it would affect our ability to purchase a property by the end of the year.

My SO and I live in a small house. It's 800 square feet and not a home that can comfortably fit the three of us plus MIL's dog long-term (as it's likely any apartment she finds won't have availability until August or September). She's a very chatty lady, while I value the quiet space and alone time my home has always offered. On top of this, my dog unexpectedly passed away two weeks ago and I'm struggling with the fact that another dog is about to be living in my dog's space while I'm still trying to get over the sudden loss.

It's a difficult, complicated situation. I don't like my MIL's decision to sell her house and move down here with no plan, but at this point we can't change that. **My biggest struggle is that I am feeling so resentful and angry toward her for putting this unneeded stress on me and my SO, and I don't want to harbor these feelings, as she is really a nice lady and she's about to be a constant fixture in our lives.**

TL;DR - My MIL sold her house to move to be closer to SO and me. We'll buy a place for her to live, but not yet. She's not making any realistic effort to find a place to live in the interim. Our house is too small to be a solution for more than a short time. It's stressing me out and frankly I'm resentful toward her for it.

We?re not from the US but she is racist against immigrants in our country that would be the equivalent to Mexicans in the US. 


I found out because we?re both dental students, she is a year under me and she needed a patient for practice so I was gonna give her the contact of a guy I checked but didn?t need much that I needed to do So I tell her about him and she goes ?is he from XXX??

I tell her that I?d give the contact to one of her classmates that works with her and she goes ?no don?t, I don?t want to have to see him either?. I?ve told her it?s not right and it bothers me and she says something along of the lines of ?I know it?s not right but I just don?t like/hate XXX people?.

So the run down, my friend is a lovely person who has barely any flaws and cannot ever compliment herself. She will always deflect any compliments and say the opposite about herself or degrade herself in passing, like ""aww this cat is so cute and I look like a f*cking turd"". It has gone past joking as she does this on average 3 times DAILY and has always referred to herself as a failure and a disgusting ugly blob. 

She has a partner who adores her a lot and she herself is beautiful, and is one of the most genuine and adorable people in my life. I have tried my best to compliment her every day, but again she deflects and denies any good parts of herself.

Our group and I all love her so much but she isn't able to accept any of our compliments.

We have had talk with her about it but they were cut brief as we don't want to make her feel interrogated.

386,starloser88,[new],1,c6v4u6,1,"Right now I don?t know what he considers me, what were doing, or how to talk to him about it. This idea of a relationship is confusing and I don?t think its what I want but I also don?t know how to talk to him about it. About 2 months ago (we?ll call him Logan) added me on social media. He had a familiar last name so I asked around and figured out who he was and that he went to my school. As I got to know Logan better I really began to like him. We would hang out before school sometimes and constantly talk on the social media platform. I learned that he is a very religious Christian. Which is not a problem I too am a Christian and I definitely support a lifestyle that follows Christ. With that though he seemed perfect. I have a lot of flaws and things about my past (im not going to go into detail here) that just made me feel not to his bar. He comes from a conservative family that just I don?t know fits the extreme model of the perfect Christian family. My family, however, we do attend church, are not like that. My family is the kind that sits at the dinner table with Family Guy on while we eat McDonald's and talk about politics or something.

Lately, it has gotten more complex than that. Logan never has time to hang out with me in person. Since school let out over 5 weeks ago we have only hung out once. For one hour. But over text, he is more than happy to tell me about how happy he is that im his girlfriend and how he can?t wait for us to get married someday and how we are just the most perfect people for each other. But if that is the case, my worry is why was setting up the one hour an ordeal? but I?ll get more into why that probably was in just a second. Logan seems to have this problem with doing more than one thing per day. For example, if its Saturday and he works 5pm-9pm he cannot do anything else that day. If I asked, ?Hey so there is this movie Happy Feet 3 on Saturday from noon-2 would you want to go see it?? He would say no cause he has to work that evening which is fine, but I don?t think it's fine to have something like that every day as the reason you can?t hang out. Even more recently it's gotten to the point where we don?t even talk. A day?s dialogue is usually something like this.

Logan: Good morning

Me: Good morning

Logan: How are you?

Me: Good, you?

Logan: Good

Me: That's good to hear

Logan: :)

Me: :)

His ex. First, he tells me he despises her, she was terrible, cheated on him and such. He always made it a point to say he hated her. One day his best friend brought her up cause she was texting him and was asking about my boyfriend and talking bad about him. Then, same conversation he told his friend about how she 'copies him on Facebook. 
""I change my pfp she changes it, I change my background she changes it too."" 


I was upset. I hear about her too much. He still has an old white spray painted shirt with her name on it. Dusty with yellow stains from just hanging in his closet for so long, he doesn't wear it. Even when I helped him move he didn't throw it away. Also, continues to keep a few memories from the relationship. Me, trying hard to understand, never really said much about it. 


So one night we got into an argument, I was on his Facebook looking at memes and I looked someone up. From there I saw her name A FEW TIMES. Meaning he checked up on her almost regularly. I asked him about it and told him how I felt. We argued for a while, it seemed obsessive to me. in the end he said he would just block her as he did.
Fast forward, he unblocked her and started searching her name up again and again. It hadn't been a month since the past ""fix"".
It didn't sit well with me I asked him about it. 


I was ready to go on a break so I asked if he needed time. If he had to sort things out I don't want to be hurt, maybe he wasn't over her. I felt betrayed and told him I couldn't trust him. He got angry and refused anything I said and kept saying he doesn't talk to her but likes to check up to see if she's doing okay.  I now feel like our relationship is not as good if he still keeps her as an active thought.

He compliments me every time, includes me in his future plans, he changes his behavior instantly if I dislike it and so on. He is also generally very respectful person towards everyone. He gets very angry when someone makes a sexist or racist comment or acts rude in general.

The problem is that he has short periods of anger burst when he gets confused. He has Aspergers and he told me he had severe anger issues when he was a kid and he had many anger management therapies which didn?t work. These bursts didn?t happen until recently and we both don?t know what to do. We are on holiday now and the other day the place we were visiting made him wear something funny. I was obviously laughing at the situation but he got pissed and pat my back as lightly as a man could but in an angry way. I stopped and asked why he did it. Apparently he was bullied a lot when he was a kid and being laughed at brings the same emotions to him. He thought I was making fun of him. I tried to explain my point of view and that was it. Yesterday we had to get on a bus and there were only a few free seats. I didn?t sit on the seat in the first row and moved to the back but we could only find one seat there. He got confused and shouted at me: ?why didn?t you sit in the front you idiot!? I was so embarrassed and asked him why he was shouting. I tried to explain him that I didn?t want to sit there because then we would have to give our seats to elders, etc. I also told him to never shout at me again. He beat himsef up all day long after. He regretted it so much and asked me why I wasn?t leaving him or at least shouting at him after these.

I know autism is not an excuse for this kind of behavior but I know that he is not doing them intentionally. The problem is he doesn?t know what startles him in those moments and he doesn?t know how to control these outbursts. He also doesn?t want to go to any other therapy since he got lots when he was a kid. I think it would be different now since he is an adult but I can?t convince him.

393,LittleMissPotatoe,Non-Romantic,473,c6uni2,3018,"My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn?t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. 

Over the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. 

Back to my father?s death (a seven month bout with illness). 

Nearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn?t have anything if I didn?t. No one reciprocated, but I didn?t expect it. Honestly, I didn?t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because ?no one loved him? and it would prove that I ?cared.? It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. 

I?ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom?s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he ?get me? for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. 

I have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he?s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won?t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he?s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won?t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is ?the Devil? in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. 

I have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son?s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.

Now that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I?ve had people who can?t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am ?neglecting? my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don?t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that ?I wouldn?t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn?t work for an employer like that.? Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, ?Who do you think cared for you as a baby?? and, honestly this one gets to me, ?Sometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can?t just ignore it.??because ?dealing with life? includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? 

You can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be ?as long as she needed.? I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a ?right to be near her friends.? I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don?t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor?s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler?s bedtime. This wasn?t an emergency. She wanted to ?look around.?). 

My mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn?t ?want me to lose my job,? a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she?s given my brother everything). 

I am at my breaking point. 

I can?t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked ?Why do you even try anymore?? (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. 

Today, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor?s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor?s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.

I can?t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father?s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at ?dealing with life,? she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can?t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. 

Nothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever
will be. 

TL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions. 

(1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him).

**BACKSTORY**\*\*:\*\* I was adopted when I was 12. Those years of my life were so garbage that my parents ended up in prison for it all, even. My mother was never a part of my life growing up, I spent every hour I was home locked in a room by myself until I was kicked out and adopted at 12. I have no memories of a functional family, no memories of my mother asking me how school was, etc. This, I understand has changed and shaped me.  
I was lucky enough to be adopted by people who loved me, but they are not people who supported me. My adopted Mom was a helicopter parent to the Nth degree. She followed me to school, she followed me to work, she would drive to my college to make sure my car was there, and as an adult with a clear head - I can absolutely say it was all without reason.  
I had straight A's, on the honor roll, I worked a full-time job and went to high-school, and then went on to keep two full time jobs while going to college. I never once attended a party, I never snuck out, I never even told white lies about where I was going. The only thing I ever did from 12 - 18 was stay up too late using free AT&T minutes to talk to my friends when I wasn't supposed to. (*i'm such a criminal)*  
I'm now 26. I had moved out when I was 18 to continue college, and have visited my parents 2-3 times a month depending on my work/school schedules since.

&#x200B;

**NOWSTORY:** My mother is the most vindictive, manipulative, hateful, soul-stealing woman I have ever encountered. I have never ever wronged her or given her a single reason to be so unpleasant to me and as much as I want to cut ties and remove her from my life completely, I just can't. I am absolutely miserable, and despite knowing in my soul that having her around is damaging to me, I refuse to let her go. My parents are the only remaining family I have. I have no aunts/uncles, grandmas/grandpas, in my life to turn to, and somehow continuing every day to grasp at this loving relationship that I JUST. DON'T. HAVE. makes sense to me. I'm going to vent about a few of the huge events that have happened that might give you some good insight to what her personality is like.

My Mom is incredibly threatened by anybody that isn't her that comes into my life. The first serious relationship I got into, I was in for 4 years - and she met his family one time. Why only one time, you ask? Because she barged into their home after agreeing to meet them for dinner explaining that they were stealing her daughter from her. That they will *never* be important in my life. She resented that they genuinely loved me in their family, and that they always treated me as a part of it. Never once was she given a reason to think this, and I just do not know where it comes from.

When I was in my early twenties I found out who my biological father was, and traveled to meet him for the first time. I explained a thousand times to my parents that meeting him was only about satisfying that childhood curiosity of ""who the F is my father?"" and NOT at all about making him a full-time part of my life.

I drove out to meet him and hang out with him for a week, and just 2 days into the trip I was receiving text after text from my Mom that were completely out of the blue.  
*- ""Why don't you just stay with your REAL family then""*

*- ""Glad you could meet your actual family.""*

*- ""Remember who raised you.""*

&#x200B;

Something interesting to note: While spending time with him I discovered that he's actually known about me and who I was since the day I was adopted. My biological mother had confessed who he was and paperwork was sent to him to sign for my adoption. I didn't know who HE was because the letters he sent were never given to me. He had tried to send me cards and letters the entire time, and my (adopted) Mom kept them from me. (I have never, and will never tell her that I discovered this).

I have a lot of stories I could jam in here and vent about, things that have hurt me, things that she's flown off the handle about - but this is a mile long already so I will skip to what has prompted this entire thing.

&#x200B;

I'm dating the man of my dreams. We plan to get married in the near future, we have two amazing dogs together, and have been going strong since day one. His family adores me and has nothing but excitement for us and our future. His mom never goes too long without checking in on what we've been up to, she texts me to say thanks for being a part of the family and loving her son. The whole nine.  
This has both filled and emptied my heart at the same time. On one hand, it is amazing to feel so loved and appreciated, and it is so wonderful to think that my family is growing. On the other, it has opened my eyes to what I've been longing for and missing from my own Mom.  
She never asks about him. She interrupts and talks over me when I try to. She has ZERO interest in meeting his family, and refuses to share in my excitement about our day trips, our future plans, or anything else for that matter.  
My mom spent 30 minutes lecturing him about how much she wishes I wasn't dating anybody. How I have no idea how to pick men, and how I have failed in the past to meet men who were good for me. *(mind you, I've dated 3 men my entire life. All of them lasting several years)*

&#x200B;

I just want a mother who gives a fuck about what I have going on. I want a mother that would even CARE if I got engaged.  
I want to be able to text my mom photos of our latest hikes and adventures.  
I want him to be able to come over for dinner and not be berated and harassed.  
I want somebody in my family that cares at all about my life. My Mom and Dad are so incredibly disinterested in anything I have going on, no matter how hard I try to include them. They don't want to hear about my relationship, my job, my home life, nothing.  
When I give up and don't include them, they come out of the woodwork pissed off that I didn't ""bother to include them"".  
My boyfriend and I just took a vacation together, and I sent 10 photos over 2 days with captions stating what we were doing, or how much fun we were having, asking how theirs days were, to finally receive one response from her on the last day of the trip. :  
*""So when will you be coming home, or are you even?""*

I'm exhausted. I want a family. I know ""all family isn't blood/ all blood isn't family"" but I want THIS family. I want MY family. I want the family that chose to adopt me, to treat me like I matter. I want to know what it's like to have a mom that doesn't seem inconvenienced by my existence and i'm so beyond broken that I do not. I have tried everything. I have tried to have serious sit-down conversations with them both over the last 3 years explaining all of this. I've explained time and time again that I just don't know how to win in their eyes, because no matter what I do I'm talking to a wall and every single argument gets turned to my fault somehow.  
I feel so defeated. My biological mother didn't want me. The woman who CHOSE to have me as her daughter doesn't want me. *AND DAMNIT I THINK I'M A FINE KID.*  
You ever see a child in a group of adults who are talking, and the kid is tugging at everybody's pants desperately trying to get anybody's attention so they can talk about the cool new thing they learned, or tell a story, or show them something they found but nobody will look down?  
That's how I feel in this family. I feel like that tiny defenseless ignored and abandoned child that just wants somebody to share in the good things I have going on, and I can't seem to have it.

&#x200B;

TL; DR - my adopted mom is ridiculously jealous and controlling. Insists on being a part of my life, but doesn't want to include herself.

395,clau_tanus,[new],11,c6umdx,1,"My boyfriend (1 year) is a bike mechanic and a friend of his introduced him to a girl cause she was interested in knowing more about basic bike mechanic stuff. The first time they went out I felt a little jealous but I knew I was being unreasonable so I just told him how I felt in a relaxed way. I expected him to comfort me by saying something like ""don't be silly, you know I love you"" but he kinda ignored me. That wasn't so bad but I feel that's the only incident in which I could be the one who's unreasonable. It was the first of many issues regarding her.

One time we were having dinner and he was ignoring me cause he was texting her. We fought but he apologized. The very next day we were watching YouTube together and he starts texting her again so we ended up fighting again.

He saw her a couple of times and apparently they'd have some tea and then work on her bike. One time she needed a seat or something so he lent her his own seat for a couple of weeks. Then they went to a store he used to work at and he basically did all the selling and even got her a discount. 

This started to seem like too much effort for some random girl to me but he kept dismissing everything saying she's not important. Even once we were supposed to ride together and the day before he started being too insistent about how much time it would take. He then admitted he was going to see her afterwards. I told him it sucked that he made plans with me first but he was trying to cut them short to see her. He apologized, we rode together but as soon as we got back to our apartment, he left to meet her anyways.

Once I went to a congress outside the country for a week. He told me his best friend might stay at our place while I was out but he then told me his friend never confirmed so I assumed the plan was off. We texted during my trip and one morning he told me he was riding so I asked him if he was alone (thinking his friend probably visited him after all). He said he was and even sent me a picture. I came back and a couple of days later I felt this urge to see his phone (which I know is awful. I feel very guilty and I don't touch his phone anymore). He had given me his password cause he said there wasn't anything in his phone I couldn't see. I saw their conversation and it turns out they *did* meet that day to ride together. I confronted him immediately and he told me he had that plan for TWO WEEKS before I went to the congress. We obviously had a huge fight over it.

He said he would stop seeing her and he insisted that she's not important. Days later she contacted him and he was like ""but her dog died and I don't know how to cut her off"". We fought again and this time I thought he was actually gonna do something. Some weeks later she needed a service for her bike and he asked to borrow the shop at the place he worked at just so he could fix her bike personally. He spent about 6h there on a Sunday (she wasn't there but still...).

I just found out they keep talking. I confronted him and he said that she asked something and that he just replied but that he won't see her anymore. He said he didn't think much of it cause it was just a question about bikes. Every time something happens he tells me that he doesn't understand why it's so problematic that he helps her or replies to her. I keep telling him that this is not just any friend he's helping but someone we've had tons of problems about. I feel like he's being disrespectful and it hurts me that he hasn't been willing to stop communicating with her even when he knows how that makes me feel. I've never gotten jealous of his other girl friends nor have I made a deal about him going out so I feel like I'm really not over reacting. Should I really stop worrying if they're just talking about bikes?

396,Emereebee,[new],17,c6ul3t,30,"I would love some advice here, because my thoughts are so jumbled up at the moment. I?ll do my best to make this easy to follow along, but I?m no writer and am on mobile and can?t sleep. 

I have been with my BF for about a year and a half. The first year was basically some cheesy chick flick. I am a divorced mom, and he has never dated a single mom. I come with a lot of baggage, but he didn?t mind. I hate to say, I have never felt how I feel towards this man to anyone else, ex husband included. All the love songs finally made sense. Last September he finally met my kids, (after being single for 5 years, this was a massively big deal to me. I never thought I?d dream of bringing someone home to them. 

A few months ago, he changed. I noticed he would be hiding things, lying about things, he acted completely different. He said his doctor changed his meds or something, I begged him to try to get the doctor to change them back, because I terribly miss the person I fell for. I honestly enjoyed the time that he wasn?t with me. A switch flipped when it turns out he never booked a trip he said he did. We were supposed to go overseas for his friends wedding. Back in feb he said he had it all taken care of. I was looking forward to this trip so much! This country was number one on my bucket list, I told everyone I was going, and then his lie fell apart and I found out the trip wasn?t happening. 

Since I already had the time off of work, and had some spare funds lying around, I booked a week long vacation for just me and my kids. We went somewhere that it would have cost a lot extra to turn on an international cell plan, so I went the week without cell service. (Got a great deal on this last minute booking, still stoked about that)
I needed this time for me, and I also just wanted time with only my kids. One night, towards the end of the trip, I was watching the kids play in the sand, and I thought to myself how I?d like some company. I thought of family members, friends, basically anyone except my boyfriend. I decided in that moment that I would be leaving him after this trip. He was no longer the man I fell in love with, and I didn?t like this new version of him, that after about 6 months (a third of our dating time) showed no signs of working on himself in a positive manner. 

This morning we got home and I turned my phone on to some voicemails from his mom. I called her back, and he is apparently in some detox center or something. Thing is, I had no idea he drank. He did a great job hiding it, but he admitted to drinking like a bottle of bourbon a day. I feel stupid that I didn?t see it. I thought it was a mental health thing, but it?s alcoholism. In hindsight it makes sense, but I must have blinded myself to it. He knows that I held my dads hand as he died at 47 due to the effects of alcoholism. He knows that I?m watching my mom struggle with her wine addiction. He knows my feelings towards this subject. I understand it?s a disease, but I can?t watch alcoholism take anyone else from me. I can?t let my children have someone in their life that will let them down. I don?t want them worrying about him the way I worried about my father when I was younger. 

Another part of me is happy. Happy that everything actually makes sense. I haven?t even talked to him yet, but I?m wondering if maybe this is my ticket to get the man I fell in love with back. If he is getting help, then maybe this could work. Do I give him a chance? Do I give an ultimatum? No lying or drinking, attend AA meetings? How do I trust him though? Do I make him get a breathalyzer and breathe into it whenever I ask? Why do I have to not trust him? 

I honestly, sincerely, really really have no idea what to do. I can?t tell anyone, because if I stay with him I don?t want them judging me. Reddit, please help.

398,sarmarch,[new],2,c6udyp,5,"Hi! I've been close friends with Katie for about a year. Her roommates moved out over spring break, and I moved in. It's overall been great and we function really well together on a practical level. Except for two things: 1. I think she might sometimes swipe my meds from me, and 2. she owes me about $500 that she isn't paying back.?

***The medication:***

We both have an Rx for adderall. We?ve spotted each other plenty of times if one of us is waiting on more or something - neither of us has ever said no when the other has asked for one. Around finals week, I was pretty regularly giving extra pills to Katie and a few other friends, and I kept count of every pill I took or gave out. After a few days of not taking any, I counted, and there were 6 fewer pills than before. I didn?t want to outright accuse Katie, but I made a comment that at least let her know that I keep count and noticed that pills were missing so she wouldn?t do it again.

Now, this past month, every single pharmacy in our area has been out of adderall; Not totally sure how or why, but no one could fill our prescriptions. I get a different medication shipped to me from another city, so I called that pharmacy, and they were able to fill my adderall and ship it to me. Katie still hasn?t been able to fill hers but has another similar medication that she likes less, but still does the job.?

I cleaned out my bag last night and left all of my medication bottles on the living room table. This morning, I heard Katie leave her room and go into the living room, and heard pills rattling, so I walked out there as quickly as possible, and she was very briskly going back into her room, and the cap on my adderall bottle was just resting on top, not screwed in. When she couldn?t get her prescription filled to repay me in pills, she told me she?d pay me in money, which she hasn?t done yet, and I assume that?s why she isn?t outright asking for more; at $5 a pill, she owes me probably \~$50.

***The money:***

Most of the time when we go grocery shopping/out to eat/etc together, I?ll pay for everything and then venmo her for whatever she bought, or 50% of whatever we?re splitting. She hasn?t completed my requests on venmo since May, and cumulatively owes me about $500. I?m keeping a spreadsheet of how much she owes me, what it?s for, and the date it?s from, just in case she tries to lessen her debt by declining the requests. Her parents support her for the most part but don?t give her a ton of excess money, so she had a job for a few weeks, but was fired because she kept sleeping through her shifts. I?m sympathetic to that to an extent, but if she doesn?t have the money to pay me back, she shouldn?t be getting this stuff anyway. I?ve found myself getting anxiety whenever I have to send a venmo request because I know it?s stressful for her, but she doesn?t do much to help her situation.

I?m not paying for anything for her moving forward and am keeping my medications in a locked box, but I?m not sure what to do about everything that?s happened up until now. I?m normally fine with confrontation, but she tends to be pretty sensitive to anything that she perceives as criticism and really tenses up whenever there?s even a minor issue, and since we live together and are close friends, I?m trying to avoid tension as much as I can, although I know it?s inevitable in this situation.

I'll cut right to the chase. My SO (28M) started experiencing episodes of psychosis this year. He's moderately better now, on new meds and on the way to being stable. But partially because of what we experienced during his episodes, and other reasons our relationship is not perfect, I feel ready to break up.

However, it's been 2 weeks and so far very little has happened. I don't think things are going to get better, and I'm ready to move on.

Since January we've been saving hard for a down payment for a house together, and since then he's started making critical comments about what I consider to be pretty typical spending behaviours.

For what it's worth, I've been able to put away over 50% of my income. I'm more frugal than the average person - I don't make a lot of large purchases, don't spend money on booze, only eat out on special occasions. Our recent arguments have been about my spending $25 to see a comedy show with a friend, and another $30 for a concert ticket for September.

He's more frugal than I am and has a much higher net worth because of a monetary gift from his parents that he invested in real estate. I think he likely spends less money on himself than I do but recently I've been feeling self-conscious about the difference in our net worth and sensitive about the judgemental comments he's made about what I consider to be relatively small purchases.

Any thoughts on what is a normal amount of involvement in a partner's finances? Ways to handle different attitudes  towards spending?

When I walked in he actually was at his desk and his wife was underneath the desk and hit her head as I walked in. She claimed she was ?picking something up from the floor? but their expressions told a different story and it was obviously something sexual happening. I apologized for interrupting and excused myself and my boss came by my desk to collect the papers.

Now, since I?m closest with my boss my coworkers are pressuring me to be the one to ask him and his wife to minimize the PDA which besides today I don?t actually mind. Because of what happened today should I speak up?

My husband and I share one car. I work as a waitress and from when I was first interviewed at my current job I made it clear that I would need 5-6 off on weekdays so I can take my husband home from work. They agreed and this was not a problem.

A few months back, I was promoted. Since the promotion, my GM has been treating my availability like it's optional. This includes not only not allowing me to leave on time, but scheduling me straight through 5-6. Its important to note that I am not in a management position.

It has gotten to the point where it is starting to negatively affect my husband's career. It is not a good look to be waiting sometimes 2+ hours at work for me to come get him. I know Uber will be a recommendation but not only can he literally not have a phone on the property, but an Uber will not be allowed to reach him.

I have had probably at least half a dozen conversations with my GM over the last few months to remind him of my availability. His response is either asking why my husband can't just wait or ignoring the issue entirely. When the schedule is released (often with less than 24 hours notice for the Monday opener), I am told that everyone is human and he probably forgot.

The wrench in all this is that in four months I am moving 150 miles away. I was told I would get a transfer but that all depends on my GM. I know that not making waves would be best for my odds of a transfer. I am struggling with creating a reasonable response.

I want to give him an ultimatum. Either he follows my availability or I quit. Is that too harsh?

Let me start out by saying, I?ve never been super open with my sexuality, never dated a girl but have been more than willing. 

I met her a little over a year ago. And I remember when I first saw her I thought she was cute. Talking to her and getting to know her it was even better. She just has a pure soul. Always so kind and generous. We clicked hard. We would text often but I wouldn?t respond sometimes but I would get overwhelmed by the length. And it wasn?t that I didn?t enjoy the conversation, it was wonderful...

She would always talk to me for hours when we hung out. Never really wanting it to end unless I did first. I think even a friend was suddenly trying to hook us up at one point. I was so nervous because I?ve never been with a woman before. Scared to let someone who?s so good into my messy & chaotic life. Scared to let anyone get close...

Fuck, I remember when we were alone for the night together all I could think of was how badly I wanted to kiss her. 

Fast forward a bit, I get a boyfriend while still harboring these feelings for her. I would always kind of joke about it to him. Like the giant ass I am. 

She tells me that she started to see someone. I knew her and I?m happy for her, I want her to be happy and I know she is. But when she told me, it felt like my heart broke in half. I know how fucked up it is, but it hurt.. it still does. Seeing pictures of them together, seeing the things they do and the places they go. 

I wish I would have down something sooner instead of being a coward. Afraid of what my family would think, afraid to let her get closer and potentially hurt someone so amazing... I hate myself for it. 

At the same time, her and her girlfriend just seem to fit. The hobbies, they?re into art, come from reeeeally good families. 

I?m going to be hanging out with her and her girlfriend at a party in the near future and I?m scared that her girlfriend will just know that I harbor these feelings. 

I don?t know what to do. I don?t know if I can be her friend if I feel like this. As much as I want stay friends. She?s going to be leaving for another city in the next 4ish months. It?ll probably fizzle out as it has been... 

If it doesn?t, I don?t want to tell her how I feel and be the selfish asshole. But I also don?t want to stop being her friend without giving her a reason. I just don?t know what to do. I?m so fucking depressed about it...

And throughout this ramble I didn?t even mention my boyfriend, so it?s obvious that I shouldn?t even be with him. You don?t need to tell me.

So I have no experience with relationships and I'm asking because  I'm kind of concerned for my friend. I'm just wondering what are basic signs of an unhealthy relationship and if this fits that category.

So two of my friends\[both 17\] just celebrated their one year anniversary. I never thought their relationship would last this long just because of their conflicting personalities. They have been getting along fine, but he seems to be taking advantage of being in a relationship. Whenever me or any of my friends talk to him, he finds some way to put us down by saying he is better than us because he has a girlfriend and whatnot. He also always claims that he is closer to her than me just because they are dating even though I have known her for almost 11 years and he has known her for 2. Once, he told me that he puts us down because it makes him feel better about himself and gives him self confidence. I know that he is really emotionally unstable and I'm scared of what he might do if they break up because he claims he doesn't have much to live for. Since I am his friend, I just let him say whatever he wants to me and I've gotten used basically being his punching bag, but I hate that he does it to our other friends(we are all in same friend group). I've brought this up to my best friend(the girlfriend), but she brushes it off and claims he is just joking. I know that my another close friend has had enough of him and is sick of his personality since he always vents to me. For example, yesterday we were all playing a video game and he kept rage quitting and saying how we suck and what not even tho he was  the one losing. He doesn't seem to be degrading my best friend tho and I think she is happy, she hasn't told me otherwise.

I guess I'm just asking how you guys view this because I sure as heck have no idea if this is considered unhealthy or not. I tried to phrase it well, but if you have any further questions then ask. Thanks!

My father has a problem respecting boundaries with me and others. 

I have a 17 year old stepdaughter. I married her father almost 5 years ago and my father didn?t meet her until after I got married. Immediately he loved the idea of having grandchildren and since my husband and I couldn?t have children he latched on to my stepkids. 

My father has a tendency to say stupid things and if you didn?t know him you?d think they were bad/perverted/creepy. Because of that I told him flat out not to friend stepdaughter on Facebook. I could see the disaster that was waiting to happen. I did not ask him not to friend I flat out said ?do not friend stepdaughter on Facebook or any social media? I did explain why, that he may say something that would be construed wrong AND that the ex wife was prone to over exaggerate things and I could see it causing problems down the road. 

He violated my boundary and within a couple of weeks friended her on Facebook. 

I found out several weeks later and confronted him over it and told him to delete her. He refused. And my husband backed him up. I then told my husband that if my father said something deemed inappropriate then HE and HE ALONE would deal with the aftermath, not me. I then told the same thing to my father and said ?if it comes down to choosing my husband or you, you won?t like the outcome?

lo and behold it wasn?t long before my father said something that sounded creepy and my husband came to me to fix it. I refused and reminded him of our conversation and how he didn?t back me up when my father came to him and that he was now on his own to deal with it. 

It did eventually blow over. 

This January my husband drank himself to death 2 months after I filed for divorce.  It was not pleasant to say the least when I filed and I explained a small portion of what was going on to my father and told him he needed to unfriend stepdaughter and cease all communication with her. I explained my reasons behind it and while he told me he would it took me hounding him for WEEKS before he finally did and as soon as he did she blocked him (I suspect he?s creeped her out and she?s too polite to say anything) 

Today he told me he sent her a text message earlier this week and she hasn?t responded. I told him ?stop contacting her. This is me setting boundaries. Leave her alone. She is a FORMER stepdaughter and you have no business contacting her.?

He gave me a smirk and didn?t say anything else. I know him well enough, he does not plan to listen. 

I actually do have a relationship with her, though it is strained and I would like to remain in her life. If my dad keeps pushing this I do see her pulling away from me. 

Is this my boundary to set? Or is it hers? I have not spoken to her about any of this, i suspect she would never tell me the truth but based on what I do know about her (I?ve known her 10 years) and her actions so far I really believe my dad is making her uncomfortable. 

To make things even more complicated my father has cancer. So while I understand that part of setting boundaries is distancing yourself from the person violating your boundaries how do I do that in this instance?

1. I have a great working relationship with all my colleagues and especially my manager, Catherine, who's a really sweet and caring lady
2. I have wanted a promotion to Senior Executive for a while and made it known to Catherine. She told me I deserved it, and that she would help me.
3. Catherine asked me if I had any intentions to change jobs. I told her no because I like this job. This is not a lie. I genuinely enjoy my job and the people around me
4. Catherine fought **hard** to get me promoted. There are only so many Senior Executive positions available here and she had to negotiate with managers of various depts so this ""slot"" is cleared up for me. She also arranged to have us meet the HR Head and Director, and justified to them why I deserved to get that promotion along with a healthy pay raise. She also graded me above my usual appraisal score to help
5. I got my promotion. All was good! Then 2 weeks later, my ex-lecturer contacted me and asked me to join his company. It comes with a pay increase over my current Senior Executive position. Best of all, it's near my house.
6. I dread to tell Catherine that I will be quitting. My promotion isn't tied to a contract so I don't see my company coming after me legally. I am starting a family soon so there is **no way** I won't be taking the new job. All I have to do is serve 1 month's notice. My question is - how do I make it up to Catherine?

414,Graiban,[new],51,c6t93t,70,"  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Felt taken advantage of, confronted my longtime GF, her response was unfair in my opinion and ultimately led to me breaking it off 

We've been dating for two years. She has kids from her previous marriage, and when I first met her she was about 15 months out of a bad divorce. She is a hard worker, thrifty, very giving to her kids, and we just clicked personality wise. I admired her ability to make the best of everything. In the last six months her oldest kid decided to live with the ex-husband, and that's led to a custody battle and a change in her child support. I make a lot more money than her, and I know a lot of her money issues are beyond her control(like I said, divorce was messy), so I had given her a credit card in case of emergencies about 10 months ago. She never used it. Maybe $30 every two months. But the last six months things have changed. She's really struggling financially, and while initially she made sure it was okay the amount she's spending on my card has really started to add up. Stuff she always did(taking her mom to the grocery store every Sunday, taking her sister to dinner, etc) now started showing up on my card.

Anyway, she's the most compatible person I've ever met with me personality wise, but I felt I had to have a real conversation with her. Over the last six months it had been over $10,000. This is not her buying anything extravagant for herself, just basically putting out fires as they arise and continuing as she had before the custody battle. In the last four years I've basically changed my life(lost 200 lbs, quadrupled my income, got my life together basically), but I was broke for a long time and $10,000 is a lot of money to me. I just wanted to talk to her, tell her we needed to come up with a plan, her living situation is different now, and even if we were married(which we've discussed a lot) we'd need to have a conversation about this kind of spending. She felt attacked, and brought up a whole bunch of stuff(the fact we weren't married yet, and if we were married I'd have no right, etc). I thought this was ridiculous since I feel I've been as supportive as any man could be, and due to my own history outlined above I'm not ready to get married yet(I want to get post weight loss surgery, finish grad school, etc first).

Ultimately, she got mad and I felt she was not being fair so I called her on it, and it escalated and I felt she was so out of line to criticize me with the marriage thing for simply asking her to have a conversation about the spending that I ended it. I have literally done everything I could to help this woman for our entire relationship. I love her to death, but at this point, after that reaction, I think I'm done.

The problem I feel now is that I'm abandoning her at her time of need. She really is in terrible shape financially, and she is going through one of her children basically saying ""thanks for all that hard shit you went through to raise me and deal with my abusive father, but he let's me get away with anything so I want to live with him"". I mean that's really hard. So I am completely torn. I love her, I want her to be happy, and I want what's best for her, but I also feel like I've been taken advantage of and I had every right to ask her about how we get from where we are now to a spot where I didn't have to bear so much of her financial burden.

Honestly, it just sucks. I miss her, but I don't feel regret that we broke up. After how it played out I feel it was the right decision. I'm just super worried about her, and how she makes it. And I'm worried if she thinks on it and realizes how much she was depending on me and tries to come work things out I'm going to cave and take her back. I was alone for a long time and being with this woman has made me realize I want a family, I want a partner, etc. The prospect of both going back to being alone and leaving her to struggle has me in a really dark place. I've never been in real, honest love before with someone who I absolutely knew loved me even more, and a part of me thinks it's dumb to let that go, for any reason.

My mom said that when they first started dating, his friends would playfully joke about his temper and it just progressively got worse as he got older. My dad is completely unaware of how awful it is - he has little to no emotional intelligence. 

Long story short, I know I have a skewed vision of what a normal temper is, or what I can or should expect from someone. My first instinct when my bf has an outburst is to shut down, go silent and leave the area which is how i survived living with my dad. I want to tell him that it bothers me, and I?ve mentioned it a few times and playfully mentioned therapy, but his response is always like ?if I?m just having angry outbursts once or twice a month, I don?t think it?s that bad. I?ll handle it.?

I deep down think he?s embarrassed/ashamed of it and it causes him to be defensive. 

I?m worried that history will repeat itself and I?ll end up dating/potentially marrying someone like my dad. The temper is the only similarity they share, however. And my relationship with him is completely different and much healthier than my parents? marriage ever was, so I?ve been on the fence about just letting it go. 

If I tried to compare him to my dad in an intervention, he?d be deeply offended because my dad is actually severely mentally ill/abusive. I just know that?s not the way I can go about things with him. 

I really just don?t know how to unpack this, if I?m overreacting, or if I?m under-reacting. 

tldr; boyfriend?s temper reminds me of my dad?s, but that?s where the similarities stop. How/should I confront him about it because it upsets me? Or should I let it go because it?s his only ?flaw? in our relationship?

Edit: I also wanted to note that months ago I think he noticed me getting very upset once when he had an outburst and he made a comment about not wanting to act that way anymore, and the amount of outbursts noticeably decreased.",1561773707.0,I [23F] am worried about the long term progression of my boyfriend?s [24M] temper.,1.0

I?ll try to keep this easy to follow, *this is a long and drama heavy post, fair warning*. So myself (m25) and ?Q? (f18) met recently through a friend zoned buddy and hit it off harmoniously. Q has been through a lot from what I?ve gathered so far(cutter). From the worst form of abuse (13y) (which I believe to be the original source of all her darker layers) to various levels of neglect, sever (previously completely uncontrollable) alcoholism, and abusive relationships. She?s a beautiful soul but she torments herself, I can only guess running from dark places. Anyways, she?s brought some heavy ex baggage with her, from a mentally abusive and unstable gaslighting relationship (9mo over, 2.5y long). She still has feelings for this X, despite being cheated on among sever verbal abuse and is in fairly regular contact with X. By law she shouldn?t be seeing him (court ordered, truly a bad relationship) but I believe with her history of abuse (I was told I?m the only one that knows about the big one) she?s a sucker for pain. Even telling me that I?d have better chances by being a bit abusive as that?s what she?s used to. Q doesn?t have a lot of people in her life she can count on, her family is going through various issues and she?s not close enough to them to talk about her trauma. She?s exceptionally beautiful and thus her extreme and compounded confidence issues literally seem completely laughable (I thought so until I realized the depth of her story) so making stable female friends is almost impossible. Of course she can make guy friends but her attraction and personality often get in the way of the friendship being mutual, thus unrewarding and hollow. So Q hasn?t had much in the way of healthy relationships and I think that?s going to be a big part of her healing process. Now I?m told (by near all that meet me) that I?ve got ?a good heart? and wear my heart on my sleeves, I want to be there for Q, there are great prospects between us, she?s expressed attraction verbally and physically towards me but toned it back recently not wanting to hurt her X. I?m confident I?m mentally stable enough to uphold a good environment for her to find herself, however I?m scared to death of investing my heart into her, just to patch her heart whilst mine transfers some of the damage. At the same time I feel like if I run then I?m throwing her to a destiny of despair that?s only self inflicted because of unimaginable torment that wasn?t (what if I really am the only person she?s told?).

He is a very kind person and I have known him for about 8 years now, making this friendship an important one to me.

Him and his girlfriend have a gaming room and usually play at the same time, but not with each other. 

His girlfriend likes to scream very loud, sometimes for no reason (to ""prank"" him), sometimes because she gets scared. I don't think I've ever heard her speak normally. She is always yelling, which wouldn't bother me by itself  but the loud screams without warning do.

I have a heart condition. I have had two heart surgeries and I've had a heart attack in the past, as well as a stroke when I was younger. He is aware of this. I have mentioned several times that my heart hurts when she screams out of the blue and my other friend, M [22M] had mentioned it too.

She hadn't stopped. I'm not sure if he relayed the message to her or not but I'm starting to feel like I'm wrong, because one of my friends says that she most likely has ADHD and therefore it's ok.

I'm a very anxious person. I don't know how to mention this to him or her without sounding rude. It genuinely causes chest pains to me and my boyfriend [26M] said that if something isn't done about it, he'll speak to them himself.

424,ApartFeature,[new],4,c6stfs,0,"I've been with my boyfriend for two years. We met in high school and went to colleges very close to each other. Because of this, I have been able to see him as consistently as before we started college. He makes me really happy and is my best friend -- I enjoy spending time with him and we work together well as a couple (we communicate and handle issues smoothly). However, I'm starting to feel that we would be better off just as friends. This is mainly due to two reasons:

Primarily, I just finished my first year at college. In high school, I was in 2 long-term relationships and never dated around much. I've found myself thinking about other people I've met and also found myself wishing that I was in a position to be able to pursue them romantically. I'm curious to see what it's like to date different types of people. Not that I ever would currently, because I still love my boyfriend and respect our relationship above everything else, but I still think about it. Another thing I've been thinking about more this year is that in high school, I came from a neighborhood where being openly gay just wasn't really a thing. It was very taboo, and I was scared because my mom is homophobic. I never explored my sexuality partly due to lack of options, but mostly due to shame and fear of getting caught. In college, I've found a community of LGBTQIA+ people who have helped me become more comfortable being curious about my sexuality. My best friends are openly gay. I feel that I never had the chance to explore this, and I think I want to. 

The other reason is that our sex life has been kind of meh lately. He can't really make me horny -- I have to make myself horny first before sex. I just don't think I'm really as attracted to him anymore. I've found myself a little bored with our life too -- it's very routine and scheduled, and he's not a very spontaneous person. I'm starting to feel restless and unhappy, and I want to break up with him before it sours our relationship permanently. 

But I have this awful, overwhelming feeling of guilt when I think about breaking up with him. He has shown me nothing but kindness, support, and love for the entire time that I've been with him. We've both done our best to not limit each other's lives, but I personally still feel a little limited being in a committed relationship. I'm just not sure it's what I'm looking for right now. I haven't been single as an adult out of my parents' house yet, and I feel like I need to learn to depend on and focus on only myself. I love my boyfriend very, very much and I do enjoy being with him, but I'm restless. I feel really bad and conflicted about giving something up that makes me happy, but at the same time, I feel like I need the chance to explore in order to ever be content in a long-term relationship. If that makes sense?????

I don't even know what to say to him. I'm looking for advice on how to own up to these feelings and stop putting the breakup off, and what to say to my SO to express how I feel. How can I express to him that I still love him just as much as I ever did, but need to break up with him for myself?

The only thing is he used to sleep around quite a bit and has told me that he has slept with his best friend (23F) about 2 years ago. I don't really know how many times or if they were ever fwb but he said it took a long time for their friendship to become normal again. I have met her a couple times, she is very nice although we don't have much in common (both looks and personality). We are different ethnicities and she is very loud and outgoing, while I am more on the quiet and reserved side.

At first, I was uncomfortable with the whole situation since I could never imagine sleeping with any of my close male friends. We talked about it briefly and he reassured me that it hasn't happened in a long time and that he really likes me etc. I really appreciate that he was honest and upfront about it since it would be way worse if I found out later. He wanted me to know there was history there, but nothing has happened in a long time and especially not while we have been together.

I don't worry when he hangs out with her alone because I trust him but it makes me a little uncomfortable that he wants all of us to hang out together. He does PDA (hold hands, hug me, sometimes kiss me) in front of her and other friends but it still is weird for me. I'm not sure what to do about it because I know this is probably just an insecurity of mine and actually doesn't have much to do with their relationship.

""I know you were the last chance I had of a happy life and I blew it. Deep down I knew I always I would fuck it up somehow, it was too good to be true.""

""The guy you loved is still in me but he is drowning, I need to save him. I can feel him in the backseat of my brain most of the time, but he is too much of a coward to take the wheel. Instead the asshole is driving and his only concern is protecting himself by staying away from everyone. I don't want to stay away from everyone, especially not you. The asshole in me is afraid to get hurt and the guy you fell in love with is afraid of hurting you, which is all he ever did. For what it's worth you are and always will be my only love.""

""Please give me one last chance to become that man again, I will do anything. I won't let my depression control me anymore""

""I have driven away the only thing in the world that really mattered to me outside of my family. By feeling sorry for myself and being a selfish jerk about it.""

""I still love you more than anything in the world, you are absolutely perfect and I knew it from the start, but I fucking blew it because I can't even act like a normal person and get my shit together. I don't know when I stopped trying to win you over every day, but I miss it. Somewhere along the way I stopped trying, I stopped trying in life.""

""Please give me one more chance to show my love for you and get back to life. I need to see you. I need to hold you. I need to cry in your arms so much. God I really wish I could cry in your arms right now.""

""I am so sorry I didn't let you help me. I can't do this alone. I want our future, now I feel like I don't have one at all. 30 years I waited and I fucking blew it. Please tell me what to do.""

Reading his emails, I felt a mix of emotions.. from sympathy, to wanting to trust him, to love, to distrust/fear of getting hurt by him once again, to distrust of his words being just words, fear of the vicious cycle continuing, a desire to help him, fear of him possibly ending his life... just so many emotions that I can't think straight.

When we are actually back together, he feels ""smothered"" by my love and care, and gets distant. I'm the one who's more ""pursuing"" when we're actually together. And when I'm pulling back, he's the one who gets incredibly anxious and starts saying things like this...

434,terrible-plan,Relationships,0,c6sd3q,0,"I [51F] am back together with my long time boyfriend [35M]. We've been together on and off (mostly on) since 2011. He is absolutely the Love of my Life. 

We broke up Nov 2017. He started dating someone [30sF] immediately, I waited until the following June. And then I got married [52M], Oct 2018. 

I married a friend with whom I thought I would enjoy growing old. We'd met online on a previous break with TLOML. There was no spark, just a friendship. He moved nearby in March of 2018 and we spent a lot of time hanging out. All I can say is that it seemed like an excellent solution. We were the same-ish age, we could retire on the same timeline, we got along well and could eventually travel and look after each other. 

After we got married things changed dramatically. He was very jealous, very needy and it was stifling. He'd get annoyed if I wanted to spend time with anyone but him - including time by myself. (I'm an introvert.) I remember in one argument about it (I don't argue much) telling him he needed to decide if he wanted a wife or hostage. 

Nothing changed. It daily became less and less tolerable. 

In the beginning of April we had an argument. He told me how difficult I was because I wouldn't discuss anything with regard to relationships, I was very closed off.

I'm not very good at communication. His words sunk in. I reached out to apologize for what it must've been like to be in a relationship with me to my ex-husband (51M) of 20 years (via text) and to TLOML (via email).

Both men reached out, told me that wasn't their experience with me at all, asked me if I was okay. So that's how TLOML and I got back in touch. 

I got my own apartment in May 2019. Husband and I are filing for divorce. 

All three men have addiction issues. I'm the industrial-sized package of grade A enabler. I'm codependent. 

To sum up: 

I'm bad at relationships. 

My ""type"" is addict. 

I 100% get that the problem is me. 

I'm trying to mitigate future issues and I'm trying to learn and grow.

I'm hoping someone can suggest books or strategies that might help.

Anyway I'll start from the beginning.  I've known this person since high school but we never really talked until last year when she befriended one of my friends.  We hit it off instantly and it feels like we've been friends for years.

I'd lost touch with both of my friends until about two months ago when we started hanging out again.  Nothing changed we still get along the same as before .

1 month ago we were hanging out and it seemed we were getting a bit closer to one another.  She had been out of a pretty toxic relationship for about a month by this point.  She told me alot of things she says she hasn't told anybody else we just share a trust in that way.  Now I'm not into astrology and shit but she asked me what my sign was and she said how we're meant to be together and all that.  There were other things she said throughout the weekend that that just further gave me the idea that she likes me back.

When I got home that's all I could think about and decided to tell her how I feel.  That was met with the typical ""I'm not looking for a relationship, I just need to be alone"" response.  I figured that was that

Fast forward to last weekend, we're hanging out again like usual.  Nothing awkward about it or anything until it was time to go to bed.  Well we ended up having sex like 5 times throughout the rest of the weekend but she said something along the lines of ""I don't normally do this until I'm in a relationship with someone""

Now I'm at a crossroads.  I want to be with her but I don't want her to feel like I'm pushing her into a relationship and I definitely don't want to scare her away. 

What should I do?

Fighting got so bad I started looking into my own place to move to and seriously started to consider divorce. Talked a lot since then and both decided we want to move forward. We start therapy next month which is when I was supposed to start the IUI process. 


Not a good situation to bring a baby into. Need to see if therapy helps and if things change. Dont want to divorce but both of us have to work on ourselves if we're gonna stay together. I told him we need to put off any IUI appointments until after therapy and after we're completely sure we are not divorcing. 


He disagrees. Wants to continue with the appointments! Super upset and disappointed with me! Told him why would we try to have a baby when we were just discussing divorce! Babies don't fix relationships! I dont wanna be a single mom if we divorce! He says weve been trying for so long and took so long to get referral that hes disappointed I wanna wait. His job might also move him to diff state in near future and that state has no fertility clinics nearby where we'd live. Nearest clinics are hours away. If we put it off and things DO work out like I hope they will, might miss our chance to use fertility clinic here. 


I think I aready know what everyone will say, but hes so upset w me for changing my mind and wanting to put it off that I dont even know what to do! Keeps pushing me and pushing me that it might be last chance for a while! Says if we're doing therapy and committed then should move forward with appointments.

I saw him just two weeks ago and he met with my parents and everything was great. I thought I was going to see him again this weekend for a wedding, but things have now changed. 

&#x200B;

We have had our problems though - the last 1.5 years have been a bit rocky since we did a lot of long distance, and he often felt like we weren't talking enough or spending enough time together. I think this might have built up some resentment over time for him, and we often argued about this and how we would make the future work (we're both working in different cities right now, but only 1.5 hours apart). This lead to us spending a lot of time worrying about the future and how our relationship would work rather than actually working on strengthening our relationship. We talked more about this last week, and he said he had his last straw yesterday so decided to break up with me. He said he didn't believe in himself or in the relationship anymore, which I don't really understand.

He was going to meet a friend(M) of his and got angry with me for even asking, since he already paid (~50 bucks) for the event they would go to. He told me that he would join me if I would pay him back what he would be missing because of me. 

That obviously hurt a lot and I was not willing to pay him, nor did I had the urge to have him by my side. 
I told him that he was lacking empathy and that I was beyond disappointed. He just tried to defend himself, not even feeling slightly sorry.

We just acted like nothing happened since I wasnt sure if I was overreacting due to the fact that I wasn't really myself (had almost no sleep and was worried about my mental health since I haven't lost anyone that close yet).

442,helloitsathrowaway4,Non-Romantic,3,c6rxxr,3,"Throwaway, cross posted to JustNoMIL. So a little background info: My SO (M25) and I have been together for about 5 years, and his brother has been with his girlfriend for about 1.5 years. They live with my in laws, rent free. He is my SOs only sibling and is a few years older. We are all in our 20s. I'll refer to my BILs girlfriend as *Jane* from now on. Jane and I are a lot alike; we even have the exact same occupation (at different places). 






My MIL and I used to be very good friends. I dont have any family to speak of so she really took on that mothering role for me. We would hang out all the time, go shopping and go to the salon, etc. My SO is very close with her too, so we hang out at their house all the time. However, our close relationship really changed after Jane moved in. For whatever reason, my MIL has taken it upon herself to always point out how much better Jane is at *everything.* 






For example, I called my MIL a little while ago because my dog was having some behavioral problems and I wanted advice. She said, ""well, you know, *Jane* has two dogs too and *she* takes them regularly to [obscenely expensive trainer] *and* for three mile runs *every day,* even though she works way harder and more than you do!"" 






I also have struggled with an eating disorder since I was a child. I'm not sure how much anyone knows about it, as I'm very very private about it, but I do bounce around a BMI of 15/16 and am extremely fussy about food in public. Now, whenever I mention anything about my eating habits or anything remotely related, my MIL says something like, ""Well *Jane* doesnt worry about her weight at all. *She* isnt shallow like that. She eats whatever she wants and is fine!"" Jane is at a healthy weight, and is an absolutely beautiful girl, btw. 






And it goes on and on like that. Whenever my in laws visit our house, MIL mentions how much cleaner Jane keeps their area, even though *she* works far harder than I ever have. It doesnt matter what it is I'm talking about, MIL always makes it a point to remark on how much better Jane is at the thing or how Jane's opinions on the matter are so much more understandable or how much better of a person Jane is. It's really starting to take a toll on me, and it is inadvertently making me resent the girl! Which really isnt fair, because shes a perfectly lovely girl and makes my BIL so happy. It's gotten to the point where I no longer want to visit with them at all because I just leave feeling hurt and angry.






My SO is also deeply hurt by this, firstly because the whole situation angers him, but he would never confront his mother over it due to the family dynamic. He also feels like he has been put in the middle, and doesnt know what to do. 






It all came to a head for me recently (prompting me to post here) because we have a big family event coming up, over a multi day span. It begins on a day when both Jane and I had to work -- she managed to get the whole day off, but I didnt. I still have to work half the day, which would make my SO and I somewhat late for the event - but again, it's a multi day affair, so I didnt think it would make much of a difference. Well, we called MIL the other day to let her know what time we would be there, and she became enraged. ""What the hell?! Jane got the whole day off and she does the exact same job?! Cant [me] try any harder at all? She doesnt even care, at least Jane cares!"" (Keep in mind that I knew that would happen, so I had already arranged to go to work extremely early so we could make the event as early as possible. I mean, I'm going to work that day at 430 am!) Anyway, this caused a huge fight, after which MIL declared that she doesnt want me to go at all now and she wants my SO to go with her and leave me home, because ""clearly she cares more about work than family."" 





I just dont understand what I've done wrong. My MIL doesnt have any animosity towards me in other situations and generally acts completely normal and friendly, other than the comparisons! I do my best to be the best wife possible, a good, kind person, and a hard working woman. 





I have tried to confront her over this once, but she just laughed it off and told me to stop being so jealous of Jane, and that it was sad how much I resented them. I dont feel any jealousy at all, I just want us to be a happy family! I like Jane a lot, and really want her to be my sister in the future, but I dont know how much more my self esteem can take. I would never ask my SO to choose between me and his mom, but I cant stay in this situation. What do I do?

443,apollop69,[new],11,c6rsbe,3,"My boyfriend (now ex I guess :'( ) and I have been together since October of 2017. We were so in love, but it never really started in a healthy place in the first place, he was hurt since his ex cheated on him and broke his heart, and he was seeing this other girl about a month before we got together, so I guess I was the second rebound. He was my first boyfriend, and he took my virginity. We dated throughout my senior year (he is 2 years younger... this gap probably made everything harder), throughout my freshman year of college, and now it is the summer before my sophomore year of college. He broke up with me this morning.

&#x200B;

Before I get to the events of last night, I just wanna give some background info. I am not the most stable person, in fact, I am very depressed. I have always been very depressed since the beginning of our relationship, and he knew that, but I guess he was in pain at the moment too, so it was something we had in common. We got so close so fast, and ended up having sex about a month after we started hanging out. I wasn't ready for a relationship, and told him, but feelings of passion overtook the both of us and we ended up in love. He was my best friend, and still was up until this morning I guess.... I am very clingy, and he knows that I know that, and I've been trying to get better for so long: ever since we got together, I found myself leaning on him a lot (and he on me, I think), but I've gotten better, so much better and I'm much more independent, but the more and more independent I got (which is what he wanted) the further he pushed me away. His family (mostly his mother) has strongly disliked me for so long, and called our relationship unhealthy to both of our faces, and hearing that made me want to fix things more, but I just ended up fucking things up more because I just hated his parents. I felt how insignificant I was to them, just a temporary person in my boyfriend's (let's call him J now) life. I remember talking to his mother about an incident that rattled all of us (we basically got too drunk and I freaked out because J was calling me other girls' names that he had either dated before, or had a crush on) and she said ""I just want to protect my son from unnecessary drama,"" and I was so hurt, and J didn't care.

Now after his parents started actively trying to turn him against me, things just spiraled into something much worse. I'm an 18 year old kid being told that I'm toxic by a 40 year old woman (J's mother) who is actively trying to rob me of the person I loved so much took such a toll on me. She haunted me, and was jealous of me (which made me feel worse), and our relationship started falling apart because of her (and his whole family, but mostly her). Yes, we had issues, but his mother stepping in and trying to tell us how to be in a relationship just made everything worse.

Fast forward to yesterday. J and I were gonna have a fun day, because we felt like we had a day off (since it's summer, and I finished summer school for the week, and J was home) so I popped two tabs of acid and he ate 2g of magic mushrooms, then we went to the beach with his cousin (who has been visiting and living at J's house for about a month, he also doesn't like me, and I could feel him trying to split us up). His cousin was driving, and after the beach we ended up going to McDonalds because J was not doing well on the shrooms and he needed to eat. I paid for all the food, for 3 of us. ( that's another thing, I have spent thousands of dollars on this relationship. I have paid for nearly every meal, and everything we needed to pay for for the past 2 years, since I was working and J has not.)

Another thing, J recently got his drivers license. Before he got his license, I pretty much had to drive us everywhere. But as soon as he got his, he kind of iced me out and talked to me less :(

Anyway, yesterday, J's cousin was being a big baby because he had to drive (this was after I got him McDonalds btw), and this was when shit started hitting the fan. I started losing control of my mind and body (since I'm on 2 tabs of acid as well) because I felt the cousin was blaming me for having to drive, and the first thing that started racing through my head was ""you didn't have to come with us. you didn't have to come with us,"" and then all of a sudden I thought I was paralyzed and couldnt walk, I forgot who I was, and I was repeating the same phrases over and over again like ""I keep forgetting, what's happening, I just try to go through life and be good,"" because I literally forgot who and what I was. I forgot how to speak, how to see, how to move, everything. I could not control myself. By the time we got to my house, they couldn't stand me. The cousin seemed furious, and was blaming me for everything, like I had done something so wrong. I kept asking them what I did wrong and they refused to answer, they were just angry. They were uncomfortable being around me because of my bad trip and couldn't bare being around me, and I went home and we didn't really talk that night, but I definitely didn't say anything mean.

Fast forward to this morning, I called J because I wanted to talk about last night, but he was angry and said that he absolutely could not handle talking to me, and that we should break up because he says for the past year he feels he has been doing the same thing every day, and that he's not happy with me or himself. Also that I ""need to realize how fucking selfish I am."" I asked him what I do that is selfish, and he said that he didn't know, and that it's just constantly there and it's unbearable.

The only thing i've ever wanted from him was his time. I wanted to spend time with him, but that was a problem. And yes at first I look back and I was very clingy, but I have improved and we had been spending less and less time together... he seemed to get mad at everything I said.

What do I do? I know we have problems but I still love him so much... and he said that he still loves me but I honestly don't know, since he never really communicated with me since the beginning, even though I would beg him, ask him why he won't tell me what's wrong, tried to give him space, tried to clean up my act.... What am I doing wrong? I'm so lost, and now I just feel like the most cursed, evil person, because I am apparently so bad but never realize it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR basically, I freaked out on acid and he and his cousin (who was with us) got pissed and this morning I called him and he screamed at me, calling me selfish. We have a lot of history and have been very close for a while. I have never been closer to anyone before and I still love him... I just feel broken and lost now, I don't know what to do.

She said that she wasn't ready yet and I thought, OK, that's fine. About 10 minutes later I was feeling very excited and asked her if I could touch her breasts. She got mad and said ""no, you can't, Jesus!"" and pulled back.

Me (F21) and my boyfriend (M20) who I will call John. So, we have been together for 7 months. I love him entirely and want to spend my future with him - marriage, kids, crippling mortgage etc. He wants this too. I have had 1 relationship before him that lasted a year and 1 month long fling. I have slept with 7 people including him. I am John's first everything. We were best friends for 6 months before we started dating. We are also long distance for now - we live 2 hours apart but this is easily managed and we see each other every 2 weeks for a week and I will be moving to his city once I graduate at the end of this year to close the distance (we will not live together).


He is a wonderful partner and my best friend and I want to make him as happy as I can and grow with him as we mature. I couldn't think of anyone I adore more.


John has a high sex drive and will initiate sex almost every night. I am completely okay with this. He is great in bed and always makes sure I finish as well. However my sex drive is a lot lower - if he doesn't make a move I will just go to sleep.


Last night was the last time I was there as I had to leave early this morning. We were laying in bed talking and laughing and I knew we were going to have sex - he looked at me and said, ""So are we sleeping, or..."" which implies sex, so I started kissing him and then we had sex. This time I was on him and he was really into it. After sex I went to clean up and came back and he was quiet and in a weird mood so I just hugged him and knew he'd talk eventually.


So he did talk and it's like so many things crashed and I can't stop thinking about it. He said that our sex just then was the first time in ages that he had his mind blown. He said he feels like I never initiate, and sex is just him ""bothering"" me, and he spends such a long time getting me into the mood that he feels like sex is all about me. Basically I'm not feeling into sex until my body is physically being touched. It takes a while to warm up. And it says that it makes him feel like this insistent pervert boyfriend because he wants me to show I want it too. When we do start to be intimate I do really enjoy it and want it to continue. He isn't coercing me or forcing me.


So what I took from this is that I need to initiate, too. I need him to feel wanted. I hate knowing that I have taken this for granted and been selfish by not pulling my own weight. I'm not here to have self pity just stating my feelings. He basically said that he doesn't think I'm sexually attracted to him - which really made me feel hurt knowing that my actions (or lack thereof) have made him feel that way. I asked him and he says he does feel loved, and he knows that I love him, he just needs me to show him that I want him. I slap his ass all the time and oggle him and tell him he's sexy and yet I find touching him first so terrifying. He just said he wants me to be forward and spontaneous and go for it when I want it.


For me: I feel like I lack desire for sex - not for him - until I've got hands on me - my brain will go ""I wonder if we'll have sex"" but I won't actively do anything to make it happen. I want to know what I can do to actively make it happen. Should I try masturbating more? I rarely do. Reading sexy things? Could it be my birth control? Should I just see it as actively loving and participating and being equal and getting over my fear and just doing it?


I just don't know what's different. When we first got together I initiated all the time. When I'm drunk I will outright jump on him. So why is it so scary now? He said he feels so confused because of how it's changed. And I really understand all of this and why he's feeling as he does because if it were the other way around I don't think I'd feel very sexy either.


I think I should add that this is the first time I have had sex with someone I deeply care for. I have had multiple sexual encounters but they were purely sexual. My previous relationship we were more like friends that rarely had quite unenthusiastic sex. This is the first time I have ever fallen in love with someone and the first time I have had feelings with sex.


I just need to know how to make this right. I don't like seeing him feel how he is feeling while knowing I could easily change it. I just need advice in how to initiate more and how to be a more sexual person because this hurts him. I know sex is such an important part of a relationship as is feeling wanted. Thank you.


TL;DR; Bf almost always initiates sex. He feels like I don't want him. I think he's really sexy. What can I do to be more sexual and show him that I do?",1561766340.0,Me [F21] with bf [M20] of 7 months says he doesn't feel sexually wanted,0.87
447,kshields1234,Relationships,1,c6rodr,2,"I've been so upset the last few days. This girl and I who work at the same place were together last year. Near the end of the summer, we decided to become exclusive. But then school started and fucked everything up. It's just such a huge burden for me and after a month or two of seeing her only sporadically, I ended it because I thought it was unfair to keep her in a commitment that I couldn't hold up. She didn't tell me this at the time, and indeed I need to work on my emotional intelligence, but apparently that ordeal fucked her up for a couple months.

?

Well we're working together again. And here's the thing: she's with someone. Not dating, just fucking, I think. It's so hard seeing her at work, but even harder when we all go out and we're at the same bar together. It usually devolves into me telling her how much I like her, her saying the same thing, etc. Our mutual friend and co-worker is the intermediary through which we've both shared a lot of feelings. He tells me she still likes me but is just confused. She thought I didn't like her, that I didn't want anything to do with her. The girl herself tells me she finds it hard to trust that we'll be together and then something will suddenly change where I can balance school and personal life. That sticks out to me: if she can't trust me, what is the point of trying? I also often find it hard to talk to her -- I become sad/angry/shy -- and she takes this as proof that I'm not seriously interested.

?

She says she wants to be friends, to wait and see and then something might happen. But until then she doesn't want to ruin a good thing. This is made more confusing by her mixed signals (touching, constantly texting), saying that ""obviously"" she still has feelings for me and is just confused. She's also asked me not to get together with another co-worker of ours over whom she gets upset when I simply talk to. That part sounds strange, but I understand, and while I'm attracted to this other girl (on a purely physical level), I'd never want to make the girl this post is about upset.

?

I just don't know what to do. Yeah, she's saying wait but it kills me every time I see her. The question of whether this is just a hopeless cause has been on my mind all the time. Am I supposed to move on? How do I do that when I see her every day, most nights, and get texts like ""sorry about being awkward"" or ""why are you acting weird"" every other evening. I keep telling myself I'll forget about her but I can't bring myself to do it. I keep thinking about last summer, how much I like her, etc. I'm wondering whether anyone has advice on how to proceed? Am I being an entitled misogynist fuck? Do I continue? Do I be petulant and completely stonewall her, knowing she already thinks my not talking to her means I don't like her, and ruining even the slightest prospect of getting together? God, this fucking sucks.

?

Appreciate the help.

He always hides his phone from me, to the point of making me paranoid. I looked through it when he was asleep.

I found two things that concerned me and I am not sure if I?m overreacting or not so I want other opinions before I make something more out of nothing. 

One of his female friends sent him pictures of her in underwear on Facebook messenger. He heart reacted the picture. He did not reply to it, and dodged all of her attempts to hang out alone (specifically with her saying without me knowing) by claiming he had other responsibilities. He claims the heart react was an accident.

The second is that he still tells his ex, who he has kids with, that he will ?always have a place in his heart for her? and will send hearts in birthday messages. He has told her clearly that he will never touch her again. But some of his messages weird me out a little bit. Such as telling her that he misses the good times they had together. He claims he only says things like that to keep on good terms so he can see his children still, but she is very possessive of him and will tell mutual friends she can have him.

I am not used to any of this. This is the first time I have ever dated anyone else with children, and I think I possibly could be overreacting because I?m an anxious person.

I helped set her up with another guy she liked though (who was also my friend) a while ago, and they broke up about three months ago. I told her how I felt about her about two weeks ago and asked her if she felt the same way. She said she didn?t know, and I made it clear that she could tell me she didn?t reciprocate my feelings and I?d be fine, and I wouldn?t let it effect our friendship, but still her response was that she didn?t know. 

In the two weeks since I?ve asked one other time and the answer was the same. To maybe shed some clarity I asked her what she would say if I asked her out. She said she didn?t know. She also said though, later that day in a different conversation that she thought I should be more confident in myself. Another friend that I?ve confided the situation to says I should ask her out and that I only did it hypothetically, and she wants me to thus the confidence comment. The situation is not dire, I?m just a little confused boy who wants some advice.

I told him that it would be moving too fast for me but I offered another date idea with specific days to not make him think I?m not interested.

So, the situation is this: nearly two years ago I started at a new school, and met this guy, who I pretty soon developed a crush for. He had no idea how I felt until at our class' Christmas party we both got really drunk, and subsequently, made out (whilst we made out, he kept whispering these super sappy things to me, like ""I wonder if you could be my girlfriend"" and ""You're really cute"" etc. but also ""I hope I won't regret this later"") and then fell asleep next to each other in another friend's dorm room. I left in the morning before he woke up, and later on that day, texted him if he was feeling well (I sure as heck wasn't, had a terrible hangover) and asked if he remembered what had happened.  


He said he had no recollection of the night before as he was so drunk (oof). So, I paid him a visit, told him what had happened, pretty much confessed my feelings and asked him to think about everything over the holidays. When we saw each other again afterwards, I asked if he had indeed thought about it and he replied that he had, *a lot*.

  
He told me that he wasn't ready for a relationship at the time, and that I was too good for him and deserved someone better. That he wasn't able to give me what I wanted at the moment and he apologized. We hugged it out, and the situation was over and done with. Or so I thought.

  
Despite my best efforts, my feelings for him just didn't end. For the past 1,5 years it's been really difficult, since I really don't know what to make of the situation. We've spent a lot of time together, visiting each other, watching movies, cooking together, playing video games etc. and I even was invited by him to join his hobby group. He's pretty much become my best friend. Our conversations these days are pretty candid sometimes, and don't shy away from NSFW-topics either. He likes to tease me, never passing up the opportunity to be a smart-ass and I find that really endearing.

  
I asked another guy friend of mine (who was our mutual classmate) his thoughts, and he said that from what he had seen, the guy definitely liked me back as well but was just too young, inexperienced, introverted and shy about it. I'm however not quite sure myself. I've also talked with a close family member of his that said that the guy is super insecure and unsure of himself. To me however, he is a wonderful person with so much good in him.

  
Not long ago, whilst we were out with other schoolmates and after having a bit of a drunken emotional bout (dissing himself a lot), he also apologized how he is/was ""unable to be my boyfriend"". All in all, I haven't really moved on when it comes to him and based on his bout, I have a feeling like he hasn't either. But I'm really scared to talk to him about it in the fear of losing my best friend in the process, since I don't want to seem overbearing or too clingy or stupid.

  
Do you guys think I should bring the topic up again or should I just move on? Do you think there's something between us besides friendship, or are my feelings completely one-sided?

453,Nake_CreepsWassup,[new],0,c6r93e,2,"Hey guys , hope you can help me.

I am an unexperienced boy with relationships but it's easy for me to give advice to other people because i feel like i know how people kind of work. But when i am the one that's in a rough spot i can't get any advice ( neither from my friends nor from me ).

So , i can start the story : 
So i met S at the beggining of May this year and i wasn't sure at that moment if i liked her so i didn't do any move on her. But as the time began to go by i realised that i liked her so i started texting her best friend ( a girl aswell ) so she could give me advice ( like what to talk about with her ) and then i just texted her. Quicly i realised that she's a sweetheart that takes care of anything and i just wanted to speak to her but i didn't know what to since we just met once and didn't get to know her that much.

Time again flew by and i began to talk to her more and more often. And then i got the chance to go to one of my friends Prom and she was there aswell and i knew that she would be. I saw her but didn't want to say hi to her because it could've been wierd since that was the second time talking to her. Like 5 to 10 minutes go by and she notices me (this was the time i finally got to see her look ) and she was stunning , she said hi to me and then she hugged me , it felt great , my friends were there and i didn't want them to notice how happy i was ( even if they already knew that i liked her ).

After 1 month i get to talk to her everyday , she likes shows , parties , and all that basic teenage stuff. We get along so quick but then she has her exams , she doesn't respond that often even if i still texted her ( she even apoligized that she left me without a respond to something that i asked her ) i knew how she felt so i just let her. Exams are all done but she still doesn't talk that much and she doesn't send pics of her like in the mirror or idk (i think these were meant to tease me or something but i didn't want to be so direct). Short answers , long wait time and she isn't busy at all.

Did she lose interest in me because i didn't take a step ? 
It feels so wierd not to say to someone that you like them as i am an extrovert but at the same time it just feels wrong. ( I used a lot ""like"" in a lot of phrases because i can't stand teenagers that say after a month of relationship that they ""love"" the other person ) 

Anyway , hope you can help me. 
Thanks in advance !

I have a huge music bank on my laptop and have helped my uncle in the past download music because, where he lives, they don?t have wifi or much internet to do so. I started helping him out when I was 15, which I enjoyed and had more free time. 

However I don?t really have much free time anymore because of schooling and my full time job that he is aware of. He asked me to add music to a used iPod he bought at a yard sale but it can be risky to associate my account to potentially stolen property - I?ve explained this countless times to him. I also have an extremely busy life where he doesn?t at all - I honestly don?t know what he does but I know he doesn?t have a job or a hobby. He said to me via text, ?you always have an excuse, I?ll just ask your sister (F22] to upload music? **who is equally busy and lives in another city**

I tried to explain the risk of secondhand electronics but he thought I was accusing him of stealing the iPod he bought. In which he said ?I?ll just ask your sister, I won?t ask you anymore? and then out of nowhere he brought my partner, Nick,  into the mix and said ?Nick needs to return the gift I gave him for his bday because he didn?t have a great reaction? 

W  H  A  T

Some background, my uncle is a former(?) drug addict and my family had lots of problems because of this. It caused a huge rift in my family among other things. There was a division between my direct family (parents and siblings) and my older extended family (g-mother and g-father and uncle). Note: grandmother and grandfather both kind of enable my uncle who was the youngest of their children but treated my mother the opposite. Notably I have been the fave grandchild in the past. 


Lately I?ve been stressed out with FT work and my webclass, I haven?t been able to help out my uncle. But lately I?ve been realizing HE IS 37 and should be able to find his own way to download and put his OWN music on an MP3 player. 

How can I deal with this man-child who is clearly making a big stink when he doesn?t get what he wants. It seems he does this EVERY SUMMER. It?s been a different problem and the cycle of abuse continues. 

I suppose I need to start creating boundaries  and saying no more often. But I am hoping someone has any other advice they can give. There is so much more I could tell you about the dysfunction but that is all for now.

I feel bad because this year, we have 4 graduates in the family (myself included) and this kind of put a damper on one of those days. I really want to help people (especially family) too so I have a hard time saying no. It?s just so hard when the people I help keep hurting me.

I am going to make some names up. My friend (19f) we will call Amanda and we will call her bf (25m) Parker. So Amanda and Parker started out as friends while Amanda was currently with her ex boyfriend. It was all innocent they were friends she did not cheat on him or do anything wrong. Amanda ended up breaking up with her bf because he had many issues and also did not want her hanging out with Parker due to jealously, when they were just friends. Amanda realized that Parker treated her much better than her bf ever had and came to the realization that she had feelings for him. The two ended up becoming kind of a friends with benefits type thing (nothing sexual) just making out after school(college) and kind of acting like a couple minus the extreme physical intimacy. She let me know over the next few months this occurred that she really likes Parker and hoped they could be in a real relationship. Before I go any further I would like to say that Amanda sometimes shares information with her mother that she probably shouldn't share. She told her mother how she felt about Parker and her mom (they are strictly religious) told her that if he was not the same religion as them then it can never happen, which I will get back into this more later. She told me after some time that when she asked him about a real relationship he said something along the lines of ""I just really like the attention of many women around me and its hard to give that up for a relationship.""This to me was really bizarre and that was when I started to think to myself that this guy probably is not relationship material and kind of a dick to string along my friend like this. She also told me that the first time they made out he said ""I think we should have sex to get to know each other."" This was another flag to me that this guy was a bit unfulfilling for her. Not only did he say this but he had said to her around the time he mentioned the thing about ""wanting womens attention"" that she was not his friend, but his friend he wants to fuck.  Finally after about 5 months of this going on she told him she wanted to go back to being friends because the whole FWB thing was not working for her and was emotionally draining her since she wanted him fully not partially. They remained friends until a few months later he told her he actually did want to give her his full attention. They started a ""secret"" relationship because of how her parents are and she occasionally sees him maybe 1 time every week, sometimes there are bigger breaks between each time they see one another. Over the course of the relaitonship she has told me that he barely texts her back, he watches her snapchat stories but only replies to her when there is a major issue like her being upset about something etc.  His communication skills are very poor, he is military reserves and will not thoroughly communicate with her when he is coming back from his job each month/when they get to see one another again. She tells me she is afraid to talk with him about these issues because she has the fear of being broken up with/confrontation. I help her by letting her know that if she talks out the issues with him then everything is going to be okay and she should just sit him down and talk about how she feels. I feel that this relationship may just be having some issues as a result of lack of communication. Amanda does her best but Parker needs to just try harder I feel like.  I personally have my worries because it just does not seem like he cares for her as much as she cares for him and I almost get vibes that he would cheat on her given the chance due to all of the things he has said about attention from women, but I may be wrong. She tells me that when they are together everything seems fine, so maybe he just is bad at the whole communication thing?

456,drinkthefluid,[new],6,c6qxb0,2,"am a 20 year old male. I have no self esteem issues. I like myself just the way I am.

For some reason, whenever someone tries to help me or show me love and affection, I turn him/her away, even if accepting would benefit me. It may sound strange and douchey, but I almost find joy in rejecting others. Something about it makes me feel better about myself, and I can't quite explain why. One time when I was in high school, I had to do a group project with some classmates. After we finished one of the members said that we (myself and him/her ((I don't care enough to remember)) ) should hang out sometime. I declined and I didn't feel any guilt or emotion. I didn't care.

I have had two relationships throughout my life and both ended rather quickly because they didn't like how I didn't show any emotion towards them. But I didn't mind. I never really wanted the relationships anyways. Both of these ended years ago, and I've only gotten ""worse"" (I don't really see any fault in my actions) since. 

Nowadays I spend every second of my free time at home, away from social interaction. I get along very well with my family, and I truly do care about them, but that's it. I don't have any friends or loved ones not related to me by blood, but that's okay. I can't really stand being around other people. They annoy me. I can spend an entire day with just my own thoughts to entertain myself, and I'd even say I enjoy it. 

Whenever I see a news article about some sort of tragedy, such someone's death, whether it be a celebrity or not, I don't feel anything. I don't care. Is that normal? I see in the comment section that there are people expressing their grief and sorrow, and all I can think about is how irrelevant it is to my life. If it doesn't affect me or my family, is it worth my time? I don't believe so.

When I see people donate to charity, I see it as a waste of money. When I hear about people going out of their way to help strangers, I think it's dumb. On the rare occasion that I interact with someone outside of my immediate family, I can only think about how much I'd rather be somewhere else, anywhere but near the person I'm speaking to. I can't get away quickly enough.

I think I'm fine just the way I am. I know how others interact with one another, and I'm not oblivious; I know that my line of thinking would be considered worrying by others. But I don't care. Their opinion is irrelevant to me. Why do people always feel the need to ""help"" me? Can't I just be left alone?

I apologize for my incoherent ramblings. I'm not sure if I even want/need help, to be truthful. I'm not sure what I want. Is this normal? Am I just a selfish jerk? Or is it deeper than that? I don't know. I don't have any disorders such as Autism or anything. I have been diagnosed with depression in the past, but I don't really believe it. I feel fine. 

tl;dr: I dont spend a single minute of my day thinking about the lives of others, outside of my family. I don't care about them. I'm not saying that to be mean, it's just how I feel. I don't know why I am like this.",1561761915.0,I don't care about others,1.0

Now I've always had an enemy type relationship with my younger brother, I absolutely hate and despise him. Not in a sibling love hate way, I actually hate him and want him out of my life. He is an overweight junkie who plays ps4 24/7 showers once in a week and eats food. The smell of my smokes Is pretty prominent around my house because dad smokes too but no one really knows that I smoke.

Except for once when my mother smelled it in my bathroom and in a joking way called me a smoker and I denied I've been using denial for years now. Except for my brother who is a fucking snitch. He sleeps in my room these summers because his room has no AC. So he uses my bathroom despite me yelling at him to go use his own. He has snitched On multiple occasion saying stuff like ""I know you smoke I saw your stash in your wardrobe"" ""your bathroom smells like smokes I know you smoke"". I always use denials and tell him to mind his own fucking business.

Basically today I forgot to flush my cigg and he saw it when he came out my washroom I told him to go use his own to which he said yeah you smoke in there thatswhy? He told me he'd taken a picture of the unflushed cigg and he'd show it to mom the next morning. I swear my mother will tell my dad and I don't want him to know AT ALL PERIOD.

458,AVeryFrustratedSon,Relationships,5,c6qwp8,1,"Tldr; My dad is a cheating, lying asshole who I loaned some money to to get him out of trouble, now he won't pay me back.

Hi reddit, I'm just going to go ahead and dive into this because I need some help.

Some backstory, my mother and father divorced just this year because my dad cheated on my mother. My mom moved out and I still live with my dad, simply because I was more comfortable living in the house I grew up in. My dad is probably classifiable as an alcoholic, he drinks daily but he's never abusive or angry when he is drunk. He started his own business in a small town about 8 years ago and that's where he met his mistress, a woman he hired to be his accountant. He works mainly as a mechanic but sells used cars as well. His business is widely regarded as a staple of the town and most everyone there loves him. His parents/my grandparents love his business and what he has made of himself. This has led to him having quite a large ego. He is extremely egotistical and thinks he is the best person alive and that he can do no wrong. Anyways, this combination led him to invest more and more time in his business (which I will refer to as ""The Shop"" because that's what my family refered to it as) and he very rarely came home before 7pm and was not around much. He then cheated, fast forward, and now my parents are divorced.

I live with him in the house I grew up in. My father still sees his mistress and often tries to hide it from me, even though I've told him several times I just want to know the truth and where he is. He continues to lie to me about where he goes, often saying things such as he is going to get milk and then doesn't come back for several hours and returns with no milk, ect. I am most often home alone during the evenings and he doesn't return from work until around 12am. 

I tell you all of this because this is not the man I knew growing up. My dad was a great man and cared a lot about me and my family when I was younger. I looked up to him and respected him. Everything mentioned above has led me to not see him as a good man at all anymore. 

I still viewed him this way about one year ago when my parents were still together. I had gotten a job as a delivery driver for a pharmacy the month after I graduated highschool and made really good money (compared to any other job I'd ever had). I only worked there for 6 months (story for a different day) and during that time I made about $4000. I had put $2500 of that into a savings account. 

My father at some point or another owed someone money. He came to me and asked to borrow $1800 and promised me he'd pay me back with interest, $2000 total. He told me this like it was extremely urgent and I told him I would let him borrow the money. I feel like a fool now, but I felt like family was supposed to look out for eachother so I did it. I withdrew the money and drive it to the Shop and gave it to him in cash. He initially promised to pay me back when he sold one of the vehicles on his lot. Well, unsurprisingly that came and went and with each month he gave me reason after reason about why he didn't have it this month ect, ect. I was very patient and tried to be understanding. It's now been a year and he still hasn't payed me back.

I have tried to talk to him about it, offered to let him pay me back in small increments. The problem is that as my relationship with him has worsened, with him constantly lying to me about his whereabouts and talking down to me for not being able to contribute to our monthly expenses. I have offered to help pay for things in our home if we are struggling, and everytime he claims that we are fine. But every time I bring up this money he borrowed from me it turns into ""Okay sure, but when are you going to start contributing for ____, ______, and ______."" He talks to me like I'm this huge burden for him and like we are hurting so bad for money, but I know this is not true. He has cars that he sinks a lot of time and money into that are just for his amusement, mostly for drag racing and such. Literally today he brought home a metal car frame on his trailer and *recently new pickup truck*, claiming he was going to start working on a new toy for himself, building the vehicle from the ground up. 

This extremely frustrates me because it feels like I have no more patience and he is continuing to show me that he has the money and has no interest in paying me back. I've tried talking to him but everytime he reverses it on me and makes me feel like I'm the problem. I'm preparing to move out with my mom and would just really like to know if there is anything I can do to resolve this problem before I move out. I'm tired of being lied to and led on, and am unsure if there's anything left I can do. 

Any and all advice on what I can do to ever see this money again is extremely welcome, thank you.

459,ExpressiveAlpaca,[new],1,c6qvkb,2,"My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year and a half. Over that time we have both gone through short periods of depression and anxiety. At the beginning of this year I moved away for work and we went long distance for what we were planning on being only 4 months. This was a tough time. She grew very distant and did not seem into our relationship. I talked to her about this and she explained it is her mental state. I don?t think I handled it the best way, as I didn?t actively ask her how she was doing or consistently figure out her needs etc. I did tell her she can always talk to me. She never really did. 

Then I got a puppy and due to complications with my apartment in the city we lived, I couldn?t move back to her. I had to wait 2 more months. Before I ever got the puppy I asked her if she was okay with me not moving back and she said she was. I think this was a lie.  

Well she ghosted me for 3 days. To be honest, I am a very paranoid and anxious person. When this happened I was ready to drop everything and drive to her city, but tried to keep my cool and give her space. We eventually connected and she told me she was not okay. I told her how much I love her and how I am always here for her. Her depression and anxiety kept getting worse and we went on without really talking that much about it. At this point, I didn?t realize it was worse because her interactions with me had remained the same essentially. 

We went on a trip that seemed great to me, but I don?t think she enjoyed herself. I tried to be as present with her as I could to make her happy. I just couldn?t make her happy though. She ghosted me again right after I moved back to her city, and this time it ended in her going to the hospital to be checked for her mental health. She went home to her parents town and has been going to counseling. She ghosted me again, this time for 2 weeks. 

We met up recently and talked about everything. She told me she feels invisible and like she is a ghost. She told me she wishes somebody would take her out of this place in her mind. I told her again how much I care for her and love her, and that I will always be there for her. She asked me why I hadn?t left yet, and I told her it?s because I loved who she is deep down, and I want to help her bring this person out. We decided to stay together and work on getting her better together. 

This was all at the beginning of the week. We talked this week and she told me about how she was feeling and I validated her thoughts and thanked her for trying to communicate with me. She thanked me for being understanding. Then she ghosted me again. And I am not sure when I will hear from her.

I want to help her and I want my girlfriend back, but she won?t talk to me and doesn?t feel any emotion. I try to get together for a few days but she will just stop responding or ignore the question. Sorry if this sounded ramble like, I poured all my thoughts out. If you need clarification or me to fill in the blanks, just let me know.

I guess my questions are: how can I keep going with this relationship? How can I help her if she won?t let me help? Are these signs she doesn?t want me in her life? Am I handling situations wrongly? If anyone has any advice on how to deal with depression and anxiety like this, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR My girlfriend is experiencing intense depression and anxiety and I want to know if I am handling it right, or how to handle it better. The goal is to make her happy and feel emotions again.

460,juuuuustathrowaway,[new],2,c6qt1x,5,"tl;dr I just realized that my Ex was emotionally manipulative and I have no idea what to do with this information. 

Throwaway because some of the details might be too specific. 

I dated my ex \[26M\] for about two years before he broke up with me. One year and some months later, I'm in a relationship with my current partner \[23X\] and listening to him vent about his family. Based on the stories Partner has told me, I can tell that his family is very emotionally manipulative. I only recently realized that the tactics Partner's family uses to hurt him are the same ones that my Ex used to manipulate me. 

Ex was always hot or cold and guilt-tripping, twisting my words, and using the silent treatment with me. 

He once got mad at me for joining in on conversatinos with his friends at his class reunion when all they wanted to do was talk shop (I was the only arts major in a sea of engineers) and all I could think about was my grandma's funeral that would be in two days. 

He was on the other side of the country when I was in a dark place and wanted to kill myself. I called him in a moment of desparation, not realizing that he was literally boarding a plane at that exact moment. Later after my sister took me to the ER, he called me once he was off the plane and he was furious at me for calling him at such a bad time. He also tacked on ""and this doesn't make up for the argument we had last week, btw."" I ended up apologizing to him to for seeking help. 

For almost our whole relationship, I felt like I was a terrible screw up not worth his time and I was just waiting for him to inevitably dump me. When things ended, I felt instant relief but also immense guilt. I'm still asking myself if I was intentionally being a bad girlfriend to make him break up with me. 

I don't believe he meant to do it on purpose, but his behavior took a huge toll on my mental health and I'm still carrying that baggage in my current relationship. I could not ask for a better person to be with than my current Partner. He is awlays reassuring me that he loves being with me, but I still feel like a terrible girlfriend that's about to get kicked to the curb. 

Ex and I rarely talk anymore and he lives in a different country. I don't see any point in confronting him and making him accountable. I don't know what to do with this information at all. There must be a reason why I'm obsessing over it now, but I don't know what.",1561761303.0,I'm [25F] having a delayed reaction to my last breakup and I'm not sure how to move forward,0.87
461,heartshining,[new],7,c6qp2g,12,"My boyfriend and I got into a long argument last night about our future. He has been good to me in a lot of ways and I thought I was doing my best to reciprocate. By now he has done enough to assure me he is thinking about a future with me and I guess I have not done the same.

I've recently decided to go back to school and he seems to be concerned about this. He asked multiple times last night how am I preparing for OUR future and how do I see him fitting into the picture while I go back to school. I couldn't give him an answer and he accused me of not planning for us and only thinking of myself and I didn't have an answer so I said, ""You're right, maybe I have just been thinking of myself,"" but this isn't even true. What he doesn't seem to understand and I guess what I haven't communicated to him is that he is the reason I have decided to go back to school. What is worse is that I am afraid to tell him this. I'm afraid to even admit this because I'm embarrassed. I don't really want him to know that I'm trying this hard and I don't want to admit to feeling inadequate, and what if he just thinks my scheme to go back to school is stupid?

I need a strong career with hard skills that will make more money because right now I don't make as much money as him and I just feel that I don't have much to offer. I have a nice apartment (with roommates), a new car, a BA degree, a decent job. I support myself and I have never complained to him about money. However, I am in debt. He has a higher education, a better job, no debt and a much larger savings account then I do.?

I'm afraid that we are in different places in life and I'm always too proud to ask for help. He asked me last night if I expect him to support me through college and proudly I proclaimed, ""Of course I don't expect you to support me!"" I'm not really even sure what he meant, that was just my instinctive reaction. But on second thought, maybe that is exactly what I want. I don't want financial support, but I want him to bare with me through this journey and watch me come out on top so we can grow together and so that he can know I did it for me and for him and for us.?

We're having dinner later to finish what we started last night and I don't know how to be open about my feelings. I know it seems simple but this is hard for me and this behavior is self-destructive/sabotaging. If I don't speak in an open and genuine way than I'll ultimately sabotage the relationship and lose him.?

EDIT: Not sure why people are assuming I want my boyfriend to pay for me to go to school. Support comes in a lot of ways it doesn?t have to be financial. I need emotional support from him and patience while I get my shit together so that we can have the future we are both imagining where we can support each other mutually.

The thing is that me and my girlfriend have only been together for about two months and her dad keeps claiming that it's too early for us to be living together like this, but I've argued that it's not the same as us moving in together, just the two of us. And I have a job and I even offered to pay rent to them, but her mom declined that and her dad merely just shrugged his shoulders and said ""It doesn't matter."" Still, her dad is constantly making fun of me and my situation. He constantly refers to me as ""the homeless boy"" and he goes out of his way to criticize me whenever he gets the chance. He even thinks that I should eat dinner away from them and let ""the real family"" eat in peace in the living room.

What's really pissed me off is that is birthday is coming up on July 1st and my girlfriend wants for me to attend the party that they're throwing and also buy him a gift.

Okay so before we even started dating I had explained to him that my mental health is pretty rocky and it might be really hard to deal with me at times. Well at that time I was told by my doctors I had relative depression which was probably about 9 months ago. 
Throughout our relationship I always expressed how important it was that he look after his own mental health and how counseling is something he should look into. He always said to me he was fine and that he didn?t need it. I even had expressed that maybe he needed someone else who?s mental health was more stable but he told me he didn?t want to be with someone else.

I called him today and he is telling me he cannot deal with me any longer and saying he is suffering because of me.

We have a lot in common, I admire and respect him a lot, and I quickly (and uncharacteristically) started developing strong feelings for him. Unfortunately we?re not compatible as romantic partners since I need a lot of verbal validation and affection in my partners while he has strong avoidant attachment style that I don?t think he is willing or capable of change. I have severe anxiety and moderate depression, and after a few difficult conversations, the stress and insecurity caused by our incompatibility and my feelings for him led me to suggest we should just be friends. 

During this time we are still regularly spending nights over at each other?s houses, usually last minute texts right before bedtime (initiated by both of us and we never turned down if the other person ask), sometimes we have sex. I?m also going on dates regularly with other people. The FWB reset in my expectation out of him helped with my anxiety, and I tried my best to work through my feelings privately with time and mindfulness over my thoughts. 

This arrangement worked for a couple of months, but sometimes (like the past few days) I feel like I haven?t made any progress at all and start feeling sad and lonely again in a way that other dates can?t placate no matter how nice and compatible they seem. I think about him a lot and I?m constantly frustrated at myself for unable to manage my feelings.

I find it difficult to talk to him about this because I feel it?s unfair for him to have to deal with my emotional burden when I was the one that asked to be friends in the first place. It?s also hard to talk to my friends about it because I feel bad for essentially doing this to myself.

Both of them have never went camping. Just bought new tent and didn't even check if it arrived without any missing parts or is not damaged in any way. They haven't planned anything, went without map or a torch. I asked him to at least tell me where he is going just in case if something happens but they haven't planned even that. He just said that they will just go to first fun place they will see.

Its just a weekend trip but I am really worried about their irresponsibility. I don't know how to convey to him how irresponsible he is. Maybe I just convey it in wrong way. I hope that perhaps there will be something he will learn from this trip but nothing serious will happen.

Last time we went hiking I have planned it all and he didn't input much into the preparation. We got caught by bad weather that wasn't in forecast. We got lost a bit as mountain top was covered in clouds. I have prepared myself for rain but my boyfriend didn't. We got a little lost in the fog and he admitted that it really needs a better preparation but it seems like he haven't drawn any lessons.

Is there any way I could make him more aware of the dangers or am I just over reacting it??

Tl;dr: my boyfriend has no experience travelling or camping and never plans anything. Be it fun things or just a plan B. I have been always preparing us for trips but now he went for his first camping trip unprepared.

471,Tannissquid,[new],26,c6q24d,6,"I'm on a college sports team. It's not one of the more well funded sports, we have a really tight budget for travel. We always get the cheapest hotel or motel rooms possible, and pack four to six into a room. Or if anyone has family in the area we're competing, everyone will sleep on the floor of their house. Sometimes we've even shared rooms or houses with local competing teams we've got friends on (off the field, we all get along quite well and are happy to room together)

We don't always split which rooms girls and guys sleep in, we try to keep the rooms the same as the groups who carpool together to keep things simple, and keep from waking people up if they've arrived in an earlier car and are already in bed when other groups are still trickling in. And carpool times are dependant on when everyone is available to leave. A lot of our club members are lgbt+ so it wouldn't really make sense to enforce a strict gender split.

We haven't had any issues with people being creepy on trips, we actually ban people from competing if they've behaved badly before competitive season. We have kicked a few people who had been too pushy at parties or practice, well before they traveled to compete with us. We've also kicked a couple people who acted homophobic, because we've got no place for that on the team.

Next year, I'll be a senior and I'll be the vice president of the team! I'm excited, we've got a great group and I'm passionate about the club. 

I've been dating a guy named Ben for about 5 months and we got together just after the last big competitive season. So he wasn't around when I was traveling with the team. 

And I just told him about some of the trips we've had, and her latched onto the fact that I've shared beds with guys, shared rooms with guys, slept on floors next to guys, etc.

And he said he wasn't cool with me doing that in the next semester. 

I said that he was being ridiculous, it would be such a pain in the ass, and sometimes not even possible to get a room of all girls, depending on who's going. 

He suggested getting my own room, i can afford it, and I said no way, it would be unfair of me to be team VP and get myself a whole room to myself instead of packing in like the rest of the team has to.

I did say that what I could do is make sure to only share beds with ladies or gay guys, and sleep on an air mattress if that's not possible. But that wasn't enough, he was still not cool with me sharing the room with dudes or gay girls.

So ... What do I do? I want to make this relationship work, but my team is also very important to me

472,Creedant,[new],2,c6pzn4,2,"This is going to be a long post, I apologize but in 6 years a lot happens.

&#x200B;

Hello all, I am a long time lurker of this forum, honestly a lot of the advice I thought helped my relationship but in the end it still became turmoil. Little back story is I met let's call her Jackie, 6 years ago, on a website for meeting people, she messaged me and we became friends very fast. Fast forward a few months and we began hanging out, dating and eventually blossomed into a relationship. She met my son, and she was such a great person to him that i knew she was the one. At the time I was working for a reputable winery in my area but moved on to part time in customer service as I aspired to go back to school. I eventually went back to school, a well known vocational school, as well as continued to work, and this did take its toil on our relationship as I definitely saw her a lot less. 

&#x200B;

Well about a year and a half into schooling, I finally started opening up at work and talking to people as i was more closed off and reserved to anyone outside my department. Talking to any other female co-worker felt like cheating to me but working in customer service you have to talk to people. Eventually a good friend of mine introduce me to a girl let's call her Donna. Donna was a bubbly type of girl, very friendly, and always found a reason to talk to me. Now at this part of the story I think you can put two and two together. We eventually started hanging out in the same social circles, she somehow squeeze her way in to my life even though I hardly had any time to spend with anyone. Well Jackie and me at the time were not ready for kids, she went on birth control, the shot to be specific, and this caused her to be more cold. We started having sex way less, she was very cold, and I honestly remember us both being stressed out.

&#x200B;

Donna i confided in about all these issues, she took time to talk to me and make it seem like she cared. One night she came over to my house and we talked out front, I remember feeling really emotional and down. I remember her coming in close, hugging me, and rubbing all up on me. This seemed to continue even though I tried breaking things off with her, trying to stay away from her, and I can't excuse myself for what I did it was wrong. Jackie eventually found out and the two fought tooth and nail over me. I eventually took 2 days stopped talking to both of them and figured things out. I chose Jackie in the end, she said she forgave me, but like a leech donna never really left me alone. This went on for years till I eventually changed my number, deleted social media, and put my efforts into working.

&#x200B;

My school shut down right after I completed my degree, I'm talking within a week after my classes ended and I never got my degree nor got to walk a stage. I still carry the debt for an associate degree I don't have and have never found a job in my field of study. Now you might ask why this is important but I believe all these things add up to why we broke up in the first place. I lost my job a month prior to my school shutting down, as I wanted to focus all my efforts on passing the capstone and other classes I rushed to take. After my school shut down I went through deep depression, Jackie picked me up and got me going again I was lucky to have her. 

&#x200B;

I ended up at Amazon, honestly not a fan of working there but I did it for months. It did not help my depression nor help my thoughts from driving me insane. Well I drove 45 mins to my place of work, with Jackies cousin who also got hired the same time as me. Let's call Jackie's cousin Robin, Robin is nice, little reserved but we always got along great. We would carpool which helped with gas and took turns driving which helped with the commute. We ended up in the same department which helped us stay motivated and push each other. One day we got put on a project where we could talk a lot and I remember her just talking a lot about her past with Jackie. She started really bad mouthing Jackie, saying Jackie slept with her ex, and that she isn't a good person. She even said that Jackie seemed hard on my son and that everyone notices it but doesn't say anything. Anyway this kind of shattered my ideas of Jackie almost kicking her off the pedestal i put her on.

&#x200B;

I know that it may have caused problems with Jackie but i always gave her the benefit of the doubt. I made sure to drop her cousin off every day at her house, drive to Jackies house at 5:00 am to give her a kiss and then drive 20 mins back to my house to sleep and start all over. One day i was over, spending the night and wanted to check my schedule for work. I used Jackies computer because I was at her house. When I opened it, it had messages from her phone to a friend of hers(mac air and she has an Iphone) and i didn't think much of it but when i read a message it was talking about how they miss each other/love each other and wish they had a second chance together. Mind you this man is married, according to her they hadn't dated since high school and were just ""friends"". This took a huge toil on our relationship and how I viewed her from that point forward. She said she would stop talking to him and she did, I forgave her and we we moved on from there.

&#x200B;

Now I ended up quitting amazon, as I couldn't stand the stress anymore and her cousin moved to another state. I just couldn't do the drive anymore or deal with the depression. A couple months later I ended up at Wells Fargo and all seemed good for almost a year I even moved in with Jackie and we both gave each other access to all social media and changed both our numbers. Everything seemed right, I worked there for almost a year but was eventually let go. I was told by Jackie i needed to get another job or she was done. I found one at Carmax, was doing great, great schedule, decently easy job and I finally felt like I could breathe again. Jackie eventually got tired of not spending time together and made it known. I used to go to bed about 9pm up at 3:30am and at work by 4:15am for my shift at 4:30am and I was home by 2:30-3:30pm depending on overtime. Well after Jackie said we weren't spending time together I got stressed out and worried because she was growing distant. Spending more time on her phone instead of with me and I decided I would stay up later to spend more time with her. Well this left me getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night and eventually I started showing up late and the way Carmax works is you rack up points fast.

&#x200B;

Eventually I was let go, my own fault for not just focusing on work and I know this, well I've been out of a job for months. Not without lack of trying but I've had no luck not even an interview for a job. Toward the beginning of this month, Jackie asked if we could take a break least till she she's a change in me. I agreed and moved out, well she made it a point to tell me she misses me and loves me and i even went to her house to see her. I saw her on her birthday the 11th of this month, she always seemed distant when I saw her and even made it a point to sit far from me as opposed to before where we sat together. She was always on her phone messaging people and claiming that it was friends. Well fast forward to the 15th, we spend the day together till almost 1am to which she says she's tired and asks me to leave. I agree and we get a good night kiss and I head home, She stops messaging me very promptly not even responding to my I'm home text. The next day she has a get together with friends and we talk but she goes quiet again. I decide to check an app that we used to see where each other are called ""Life360"". We had got it because one night i was drunk and unsure which bar i was in a town i'm unfamiliar with(I never drink or go to bars). My cousin had just got out of the army and I wanted to spend time with him. This allowed her to feel safe in case it ever happened again(it didn't). Anyway I check it and notice she logged out at 2am the previous day. Which is extremely odd because we said we would keep it while on our break.

&#x200B;

I decided to do some digging(Wrong i know but my gut feelings said something was wrong) I checked her e-mail which instantly alerted her and made her text me almost immediately. I lied telling her I know(Even though i found nothing) and to tell me the truth. She came clean saying she's been talking to some guy for a couple weeks but they haven't seen each other, had sex, or anything. She feels bad, decides to come over and promptly is all over me(I assume guilt) we have sex multiple times, she calls me that night and we talk/fall asleep on the phone. The next day she sends some voice messages on snapchat saying she misses me and all this and that. She even sends me selfies and everything else but fast forward the rest of the day and we are hardly talking. Little texts here and there but thats all, eventually around 11pm she stops messaging all together. I decided to call her(She is usually up till about 2am) to which she doesn't answer, i give up and hang up. Within minutes she calls me, I answer, and she just lays into me about how i woke her up and this and that. I told her I just thought we could talk since we hadn't all day and her response is ""I'm not going to be talking to you every day we broke up"".

&#x200B;

I give her space and the next day she's telling me she misses me/loves me but ""not in love with you"". Now she gets a present from her friend to a party about 3-4 hours away from us. She asks me to go, which I agree and says we can even have a date on Wednesday which i agree to as well(this is all last week). We end up seeing each other Monday, Wednesday and Thursday(slept together every day and kissed like nothing happened). Well Saturday is the day of the party, she decides we will take my car and I'll drive up and back. Well we head off and end up getting there an hour and a half late, we eat and drink a ton of wine. We took selfies together, sat down and just talked, idk who brought it up but she claims I did. We get on the subject of that guy and she claims nothing happened of course, then talk about how she feels i'm not motivated, depressed, and not working and she needs more. More emotional love, dates, she wants to get married and have kids. These are all things I want but given my debt and jobs i've worked i feel like its so unachievable at times. Anyway, her mother and sister went to visit an Uncle who lives close by and as we had been drinking she thinks it a good idea to go stay with him and I agree to make her happy.

&#x200B;

We end up back at the car, I sit there sobering up and eventually I drive her and myself to her uncles cabin in middle of no where. It's a beautiful place and feels so good just getting away from everything. We spend time with her uncle, aunt, mother, and sister but as we are both still little buzzed we decide to go lay down a bit. We go lay down and when i wake up i just feel so uneasy and something just doesn't feel right again. She eventually wakes up and asks if we can go get our over night clothes so we can change. We go to my car and get them, I don't remember her handing me her phone but she did. I end up changing in the room we are sleeping in and her in the bathroom across the loft. I remember changing and tossing both our phones on the bed, hers was beeping and Idk why but i decided to open it and look at Snapchat. I couldn't believe what I saw, she had messages with three separate guys, one of which had not visible chat history aside her address on you guessed it the 15th. The day she sent me home early and turned off life360, the other chats were still visible and they were mostly stuff like ""I miss you"" as well as pictures being sent back and forth.

&#x200B;

She returned to the room, saw I had her phone and her eyes got big ""she asked what I was doing"" I just held up 3 fingers, she said ""3, 3 what?"" and I told her ""3 guys"". she looked speechless and then I said ""I'm done with whatever this is, I don't want to stay here. When I brought up the guy whom she gave the address to, she said nothing happened they just talked and that was it. The other guys she claims it was just light flirting except one she says they talked about sex and flirted a lot but nothing happened and they never hung out. She eventually calmed me down, had sex with me, cuddled me and then she kept getting up to go to the bathroom saying she felt sick from the wine or sea food. At about 3am I just couldn't sleep or take it anymore, when she came back from the bathroom, I asked her to see her phone because i just needed to read the messages ""She told me no we aren't together"" and I told her okay I'm done and I'll take my chances driving back in the dark. She begged me to wait saying I was her ride her back home and that its not safe. I decided I would sit in the chair and wait till morning, she continued to try to talk to me to which I ignored her. Eventually she started hyperventilating saying she couldn't breathe and that she just needs me to lay with her.

&#x200B;

I care about this girl a lot, I went and laid with her, and attempted to calm her down. Eventually we both fell asleep, I asked her the next morning if she wanted to work on us then she needs to stop talking to other guys her response was ""I need to be able to date others to see if this is what I want"". The thing is when she took the break in the beginning she said it was to work on herself and she wasn't planning to date anyone till she figured out herself. The car ride home was quiet till she eventually broke the silence, we talked and i agreed to allow her to talk to others while I focus on finding work and trying to get my own place. She claims she hasn't talked to the guy she met up with because it was like cheating on me being with him. She also says any other guys she messages, they don't flirt its completely platonic.

&#x200B;

We saw each other every day after this past Saturday, had sex, cuddled, kissed and everything else you would expect from a relationship. We had our final date on Wednesday, our rule was we don't talk to anyone else while together, which she broke and I acted poorly, getting mad and ignoring her. We eventually talked it out, ate the food we bought and then she went home. She said she has to stay home because her father doesn't want us seeing each other as much since we broke up. I'm respecting that, she has messaged me on snapchat still and through texts. We even talked on the phone(Falling asleep on it again) last night, she told me today she doesn't want to be done but needs to see a change in me. 

&#x200B;

I guess my questions are what do I do? Do i continue trying to mend this relationship or do I give up? She says she loves me, doesn't want to end things but she can't be with me till I change. As far as I know she is still going to go date guys eventually and I have to be okay with that. I want to work but how do I even go about securing a job again?

&#x200B;

Honestly if you made it this far thank you for listening to this mess of a story, I'm sorry if it seems scattered, there's a lot of thoughts going on and I'm just honestly feeling so hopeless, lost and confused. I'm not even feeling sad anymore just completely numb to everything and everyone.

474,_but_is_it_art,Relationships,29,c6pxox,2,"Let me start with the fact that I?m on mobile so please bare with me with formatting errors. 

My fianc? & I have been together for a year & half, but have known each other for almost 3 years, & dated briefly before, but long distance. We fell in love at first sight when we actually met in person once I moved back to my hometown (which is like 30 minutes from him). We had a whirlwind romance, & were supposed to be getting married August 24th. 

Here?s the problem- I?ve never really *wanted* to get married. I love him, I want to spend my life with him, but I don?t see the point in doing this whole big fancy shindig where the only real point seems to be to make it more difficult if a person wants to leave. I think marriage is great for people who WANT to get married, but I don?t really care about it. That being said, I agreed to do it because of pressure from his family & my aunt, who?s the only family i really have. Plus, I want to spend my life with him anyway so I guess why not. 

Wedding planning started & it?s been stressful since we were pressured into doing it sooner rather than later. From the start, his mom has tried to step in & take control of every aspect. She talked us out of our original plan (tiny wedding, cookout style) to hiring a local barbecue place to cater. Granted, their food was DELICIOUS but that was $750 vs the $400 we were originally looking at. She?s also argued with me about flowers, arches, general decor (trying to convince me the things she likes are better than what I like), everything. I hired a bakery that was recommended to me & she tried to talk me into letting her friend do it even though I already told her repeatedly I had found a bakery I really liked. Her friend does decent work, but it?s kind of amateur & I want my cakes/cupcakes to be a certain style. Plus the bakery we hired was very inexpensive because she?s a friend of my aunts. 

Now the big problem has been her trying to take over the guest list. We have catering planned for about 50 people. It?s bigger than we originally planned, but still very very intimate because my fianc? & I compromised on that from the beginning- I didn?t want a huge wedding. She?s invited several extra family members without our permission, & now has invited a couple of her friends. She claims they should be allowed as they?ve known my fianc? since he was younger, but even he says he doesn?t care to have them there because they?re close with *her* not us. & it isn?t about her. It?s our wedding. 

However, up until this point, he never stood up to his mom. He?s let her talk him out of ideas we?ve had, because she thinks it would be tacky. We had discussed a pizza buffet, but she told him she didn?t like it, so he said never mind. 

Now the big problem is he asked her if she could take out a loan to pay for the wedding in her name, & we pay it back because our credit is garbage. I DIDNT WANT TO DO THIS. my feelings are if we can?t afford it, we shouldn?t do it. But every time I?ve suggested it, he gets short with me because ?he just really wants to marry me?. I feel like at this point it?s all spiraling out of control, my say so doesn?t matter at all, & I?m expected to go along with it regardless. Because she?s ?paying? technically, I don?t feel like I can say no to anything anymore. 

I don?t want to call it quits because of time, energy, & money that?s already been poured into this wedding. But I don?t know how to express my frustrations without hurting my fianc?. I just learned to drive (I have crippling anxiety) & I?ve found myself intentionally staying out past the time my fianc? would normally be in bed so I can minimize the time I have to spend talking to him. I?ve also stopped calling & doing the things I?m ?supposed? to do to plan for my wedding. 

It?s also worth noting that ordinarily, I adore his mother & his entire family, really. I just hate how overbearing she can be. 

How do I get everyone to back off some & stop putting so much pressure to do things their way without offending anyone, especially when one of those people is helping us pay? 


TL;DR: my fianc??s mom is trying to take over my wedding. I was already apprehensive about marriage, & I feel pressured to stick with it because of money & time already invested, so I?m starting to resent my fianc?.",1561756953.0,I?m (23) starting to resent my fianc? (26),0.75
475,gatorate_girl,[new],5,c6pveh,1,"My boyfriend (21M) and I (19 F) have been dating for a little over 3 years. Recently (about 2 mo ago) he was diagnosed with severe OCD. His OCD is taking a huge toll on him, me, and our relationship as a whole. He cannot perform daily tasks anymore without having a panic attack or just becoming extremely irritable, such as doing laundry, dishes, making food, going out, pretty much everything. He has started hating doing the things hes always loved. He had to leave his job because it became too much and he was having breakdowns every time he was there. 
He washes his hands upwards of 100 times a day and cleans items profusely. We are often late to things because his rituals of cleaning and handwashing can take hours. It had made me hate nights because he must clean things and wash his hands perfectly in order to sleep. 

  He lives with me in my parents house because his parents place is disgusting because his mom is a hoarder. His OCD cannot take being in that house for more than a few hours, if that. He has never been the type of person to yell at me and scold me but now times have changed. When his OCD makes him irritable, he snaps at me for almost anything I suggest or say. He will get mad at me if I accidentaly touch something that he sees as ""dirty"" or if I put one of his items somewhere that is ""dirty"". This has made me fear touching anything in the house really, I feel as if I have to ask permission first. He doesn't want to have sex anymore because he is scared of getting dirty. I am a very touchy feely person and he was too before the diagnosis. I always want to hug and kiss and cuddle but now those things are rare because he often doesnt feel comfortable with being touched. This hurts me greatly because I feel like I need that in a relationship and I'm so used to being able to do it with him. He knows he's hurting me but he just cant seem to stop. I have a part time job and whenever I have to leave for it he has a breakdown and suffers the whole time I'm there because he says it's hard for him to be alone. This puts immense pressure on me to always be home and cater to his needs instead of mine. I have been avoiding doing things that I actually enjoy because I'm helping him through panic attacks and helping do the rituals. I feel like I am constantly comforting him and helping him come out of a panic attack. I have an anxiety disorder myself, and when he is in an attack mine shoots through the roof but I do my best to ignore it in order to give my attention to him. Whenever I try and Express how I am feeling to him, he just gets mad and says that he can't control how his OCD works, and I understand that, but it doesnt mean that I can't suffer. He revealed to me that when he knows he hurts me he has suicidal thoughts. 

We had a super super good relationship before this diagnosis. We never once fought in 3 years other than normal disagreements, we had an amazing time with eachother always. My boyfriend knows that his OCD is destroying his life, but he knows it's out of his control. He is a very good person, but OCD has made him into somone else. He goes to therapy every two weeks and sees a psychiatrist once a month. But it isnt enough. He is on his second medication but nothing has changed, actually things have become worse. Recently we went to the hospital because he was having thoughts of suicide and things became too much. The hospital mistreated him and did not decide to admit him. The only other option I can think of is going to an impatient mental heath unit or a residential facility, but we would have to travel at least 2 hours and it would be extremely expensive. I am just not sure what to do in my situation. I miss the little things he used to do like kiss my forehead, grab my butt playfully, hug me from behind, the cute little things. I can feel him not listening when I talk more and more because he is worried about other things. I feel trapped in a way because though I still really love him I am not happy. He doesnt really have any friends so I am his only support system. He has no where to go, his house is basically inhabitable to him and he doesnt have any other family around. And he says he needs me. I believe in him getting better and I want to be there for it, but the process is taking a big toll on my mental health. I love him so fucking much and I want him to get well and become closer to his normal self.

476,tjanith,Breakups,4,c6puhh,0,"Our story goes way long and we had a so great relationship. Our sex drives were different and we were struggling although in my point of view it didn't do anything harm to the relationship.But because of things she broke up with me. Made me miserable and I was going through some other rough times and she broke up with me made it more hard to stand the life.

So in our college there's this annual event things that anyone can attend. It was kind of our special day in college, now I'm not going to college anymore. She's inviting me to come to it, she's doing her best to invite me in without sounding desperate. I know she still loves me and misses me but she doesn't want the relationship.

What sucked was that she broke up with me more than a week ago and two days after she broke up she made out with a guy who I was paranoid about back then when she hung out with them and she made out with her friend as well, I asked her about this and she said she was typsie and dared to make out with them and she wanted to have fun. This scared me so hard because beginning of our relationship was when she dumped other guy for me and we started dating a month after but through out that time she did not let anyone post a single picture of us together or even kiss me in public because to respect her ex. What scared me was that I felt and feel like she didn't respect me.

In my honest opinion her friends made her feel like that being in a relationship is depressing because when she wasn't hanging out with them she was completely normal.

My question is that she wants me to come to the that event but I don't know what I should do. I can go without any problem but I can stay home without any problem as well.

He was obviously attracted to me since he asked me some time during the convo if I had a bf (I don?t have one and he wasn?t persistent about it when I told him) and gave me some compliments like ?you?re kind and beautiful? and ?you?re so cool?. 


However about a week later I spoke to him to see what he was up to and I think I caught him in a horny moment since he immediately said that he wanted to meet me. The thing is he asked me if he should come to my place. I said no and he said ?okay sorry? then I told him it wasn?t very nice for him to ask that and that this isn?t a dating app. Then he mentioned he only wants to ?talk to me to practice English?. 


I?m not gonna lie, I find the dude attractive which is the reason why I didn?t mind talking to him in the first place but I wouldn?t go as far as to invite him over for the first meeting. But anyway I mentioned we should just meet up at a cafe.

She has been posting on Facebook, and Snapchat so I know it's not a case of her just being too busy. I convinced that she's ignoring me for some reason.

479,KennyOmegaXMan,[new],17,c6pqdd,13,"I'm a 29-year-old guy who has never been on a date or even been close to having one. So I have been single all my life and never had any type of experience with a relationship. This is really hurting me and at times it really hurts, and I want that to change and I'm not sure what to do. So I am reaching out on here for help.

Here are some details about me if it matters. I'm from New England. I would be considered a nerd but am open to trying things I wouldn't do. I guess I am into things a typical nerd is into, and go to conventions in my area like Comic-Con and PAX East. Recently I did something I have never done which is going to my past school's gym, it's free, to gain weight and muscle, I've always been considered underweight. So I am trying new things, even tried an obstacle course gym earlier this year.

I guess my main issue is I don't really know anyone other than my family when it comes to going out. My parents weren't the best to me and abusive, they had much control so I never learned to be myself and to grow. I didn't go out really at all during my childhood years and didn't have friends. I have always been considered quiet but I'm not sure that's true. But I have fears and phobias from the things that happened from my childhood, which involve my parents. So I am very stuck now and feel very isolated that it is this way, and hopeless at times it's going to change.

All I know is dating apps to meet women that would be interested in me, and I never been any closer to a date. I use Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid, it's hard enough getting a match and when I do they don't reply or one response and that's it. I think I am good with my messages and have creative ways but it doesn't matter. It could be my profile pics that need a change, I've looked into getting professional pictures that are for dating apps. But in the end, I have never been on a date.

I'm not sure how I would do on a date but last year I did do Geek Speed Dating at Rhode Island Comic Con and it was a first for me. I was nervous inside but I didn't allow me not to do it. There weren't many women that participated, only about 10, two of them were older, but I was really disappointed that I didn't get a single number in the end. I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do that, get a number from a woman. I went to the Con alone since I didn't anyone, so it was a big downer.

I have looked into local events in Providence, Emo Night and Cosplay Night at a bar. I wish I could go but I don't know anyone to go with, I'd be a stranger and I think I would feel out of place. I should have mentioned I don't drink, I don't think it's for me. I think I would be keeping to myself and not talk to anyone unless they start a conversation with me. I wish I knew someone who could go with me to events like this and guide me through. But I was more concerned that how would I eventually go on a date? I don't know how that would happen when it's never happened to me, I mean asking someone out.

It's really disappointing that teenagers have more experience that I have with all of this and I am going to be 30 this year. I don't know where to look and how to overcome this. I have looked into dating coaching in my area. Unless you have experienced not going on a date at my age and wanting to have someone in your life, you wouldn't know how those feelings of loneliness bring you down inside. I'm hoping that this will change though, with changes in my life and asking for help, which I don't do.

There are guys in the same position as me online, on here also but I never would associate myself with those hate groups. So if you are reading this, thank you for doing so.

480,jap913,Non-Romantic,5,c6pq3u,1,"We hung out daily for a year and were in a relationship for 4 months. We broke up 2 months ago with a (petty) fight, we went no contact. Few days ago, she texted me apologizing she ended it in such a way. I was glad she apologized, she said many nice things (wasn't overly nice), we were just acting correct, friendly. She said she missed me and I'm like her best friend. She explicitly stated she doesn't want a relationship but wants friendships. 

Now here's where it gets tricky for me. Honestly, I'm 80% sure she's a covert narcissist. If she isn't a narcissist, then she's definitely emotionally immature and possesses a lot of narcissistic traits. I'm an empath. I still care for her, but I don't know how to approach this. I don't want to hurt her, but honestly I suffered a lot from her abuse. Her apologizing doesn't make that go away. 

Then again, she wasn't always like this. She became abusive only at the end of the relationship. I don't know what to think honestly... maybe I'm just imagining stuff. We were great friends before we got into the relationship, maybe all those emotions were just too much for her to handle. I don't know.

I feel like I have 3 options:

1. Cut her off. Completely. Write a letter saying why and thanking for the good time then blocking on all social media.
2. Remain casual friends. Hang out with her a few times a year, see how things develop.
3. Try to be close friends again. See how that goes.

What should I do?

My initial plan was to talk to her, be honest, say I don't trust her and don't want to be friends but I'd like to hear from her every once in a while. Now I'm thinking whether it's risky to even do that.

I also learned that she try to talk about me as little as possible.

Of course, I was deeply hurt by all this. So I confronted her about this.

She ended up admitting that she?s ashamed of my job! She said it is embarrassing and intimidating to be around all those people with money and prestige and telling them that I am a mechanic. 

This upset me big time. About a year into our relationship, she was on verge of dropping out of college because she cannot handle the load from the college and work.

So I told her she can leave her job and I will support her while she finish up college.

So for three semesters, I pretty much put her through the college and now I?m getting this treatment!

It is so hurtful and upsetting to me. Yet she keep telling me she gotta keep a face for a bit before she can be more open about me!

&#x200B;

I've been dating this girl since highschool. We went to the same college. We lived next door from eachother one year and it was great fun. Her friends were my friends to an extent because I never really had too many friends of my own until my senior year when she left (She graduated 3 semesters ahead of me). 

&#x200B;

She is now going into her second year of pharmacy school in Charleston and I got a sweet deal to go to grad school in Pennsylvania. We've done the long distance thing plenty over the years (7 of them) and it worked out so far because we've always been able to just drive 2-3 hours to see eachother. Obviously it will be a little harder when I go to grad school. 

&#x200B;

What I'm struggling with is what I think are some compatibility issues that I've been ignoring for way too long. 

&#x200B;

They kindoff came to a head when we went to bonnaroo a couple weeks ago . . See music is like my life blood and I love to get down at concerts. She isn't really into the scene all that much but she purchased a ticket this year because I rave about it and how it makes me really happy. She told me later that she mostly bought the ticket for me, which is really nice that she wants to share in this thing that I enjoy (she was v excited for post malone and childish gambino though). 

Anyway I go the first day sober and on the second day I blaze a joint with the rest of our group at a band I was really excited to see. Admittedly I got a little too stoned because my tolerance was really low and that weed was super strong. 

So she gets onto the train she does a lot of the times when I smoke and gets really accusatory about how I act when I smoke weed. I tell her I enjoy it as an alternative to alcohol because alcohol makes me feel sick. But she says that I ignore her when I smoke and just stare off into space. 

I know that its not healthy and she wants the best for me but I don't understand how she feels like I act so differently. Personally I feel like I want to be more affectionate when I'm high, but I've never been able to feel comfortable around her during it because she is not okay with it on a fundamental level. Like she says its fine I can do what I want but we always end up arguing about it. Her ex before me was mean to her when he smoked and did it way too much which I think is why she is this way. I really don't want this to be about weed, that's just dumb. But we ended up yelling and splitting up in the crowd and it was messy. Bonnaroo is just like my happy place and she kinda ruined that for me. 

&#x200B;

At some points it's honestly somewhat embarrassing when I'm with people who are my style and she is really loud and says shit that just makes me cringe. 

&#x200B;

The other more important issue(s) are about commitment. We have been through so fucking much together it's silly. People have married eachother in a fifth of the time we've been together. And she wants a freaking ring and makes it really obvious. At this point I'm questioning whether this is the life I really want for myself. Like how am I supposed to be engaged living in a 1 bd apartment for who knows how many years stuck in a PhD program when my fiance is multiple states away at a different school?

&#x200B;

I want to make her happy more than anything but I don't know If I can give her the life she wants (marriage, kids, dog, etc).

483,Butterballjenkins,[new],8,c6pdlr,0,"Question Redditors - I?ve lurked for along time and this my first post, sorry for the lengthiness!! 

I have wonderful girlfriend (she?s 22 I?m 24) been dating for 6-7 months who I adore in every sense. She is beautiful and we have a strong mental connection that has shown me my true self in a lot of ways and shown me what it?s like to be in love. Because of this I sometimes have over shared about my past and seemed self-absorbed at times because I?m excited to finally be with someone who gets me. 

I had a difficult upbringing switching schools a lot and feel like I?ve been pretty underdeveloped sexually. I?m experienced now but it all happened later in my life in the past couple years after college. I?d had a girlfriend in high school and several sexual experiences but nothing very mature feeling. I?ve always felt somewhere on the queer spectrum, open to potentially exploring a same sex experience and enjoying it and not being disgusted by my minimal attraction towards the same sex?i don?t think I could ever call myself bisexual because I don?t feel I could ?go both ways? in terms of finding a partner or even a hookup but I?m generally curious and adventurous and ?straight? doesn?t really sit right with me so therefore I?m open to experimentation whatever that might look like. At the end of the day though I?m 99% certain I?ll end up with a woman and women are the object of my sexual desire?the rest is all just curiosity without a real driving desire. 

Recently I shared all this with my gf when were having an intimate conversation and she also shared that she is bisexual and was very supportive of me being myself if a little confused by my lack of need for a label. She really just wanted to understand me and I explained how I?ve always not really felt straight but haven?t ever desired same sex partners romantically and physically all been mild curiosity. I also told her about the mmf threesome I had and how it was a fun experience (there was no same sex interaction) but I didn?t really feel the need to it again. She told me about her own same sex experience and how it confirmed what she already knew about her sexuality. I told her nothing really grosses me out and all that matters for sex is all parties involved are enjoying themselves and being themselves. Again she was very supportive and even said if I ever had a strong urge to experiment with the same sex she would be open to being supportive of it. We ended it on we were both supportive of each other exploring our desires and didn?t want to rule anything out but didn?t see anything coming up anytime soon because we both don?t really notice anyone but each other.

It was really pretty beautiful feeling and I felt so close to her and accepted for who I was...until she left for the week and I started overthinking (I have pretty bad anxiety and a stressful job and I take medication and she does also). I started thinking she must be grossed out by me and think I?m trying to share her and not focused on her if I?m thinking about experimenting with the same sex and that kind of thing. I started to get so worried that I?d somehow killed our vibe and destroyed the bond we had and that I needed to fix it even though when she left we were on a great note and I felt closer to her than ever before like we were the same person in two bodies. I don?t know where all the doubt came from but generally I have ocd and tend to worry about everything (for a while I worried I was gay or definitely bi not that that would matter, but my ocd sometimes tried to convince I?m lying to myself about the most core aspects of my personality and it can be incredibly draining?there was a time where I worried I was a Murderer and could snap at any time so I know my fears are pretty irrational and not to listen to them) so i was getting panicky about the whole thing and I called her in a pretty anxious state asking if she was okay with who I was. She seemed surprised and taken aback and said ?well is there a reason I shouldn?t be ok with it?? And I said no that I was probably just overthinking and I wanted to make sure she didn?t view me any differently. We rehashed the conversation from the previous night and this time she was a little more inquisitive about specifics probably since I was bringing it up for a second time. In rehashing everything I mentioned again being open to a same sex experience and sometimes I had fantasies and she asked specifically what they were and even though I don?t have a specific fantasy I?m dying to try or anything like that I felt like I needed to say something and I mentioned a few ideas that have seemed intriguing such as ?mutually masturbating or maybe giving oral? but I wasn?t very concrete and even said I wasn?t sure if id want any physical contact at all and basically just came off as confused when instead I was just trying to express a general sense of openness toward the idea of a same sex experience and I really don?t feel the desire to do any one thing. It eventually did get to more ?well since you seem to be confused now I?m feeling a little worried you might be hiding something from yourself? and something along those line and I totally get that but given that I?ve had experience with mmf and generally have a good idea what my life experience indicates in terms of attraction tendencies (I?d say I?m pretty in tune with myself) I felt confident in my general openness with a lack of strong desire?to me that?s just being 80-90% leaning towards the hetero end of the Kinsey scale. because of anxiety and overthinking in this specific instance though I was all over the place with my words and on top sharing specific ?fantasies? (which I more view as just mental experiments) I mentioned the word bi in relation to myself and said some pretty loaded things that I feel were just saying too much and speculating on things that don?t need to be speculated on (see how I spiral out??) and eventually she said she was confused and didn?t know if I was just trying to tell her the same thing we already talked about the other night (which that?s exactly what I was doing and wanting to confirm she was ok with it) and in that case why was I calling her, or if I there was some deeper confusion ie I?m bi or confused. In reality I was confused in the moment but deep down pretty sure of myself (as sure as one can be about these things) but I know I rambled and said some confusing things I regret. We ended it on yes I was just telling her the same thing we already talked about that I?m not bisexual in terms of going both ways romantically and sexually but I am open and curious and not disgusted by the idea of a same sex experience and a wide variety of sexual experiences in general. She was still supportive but definitely not with the same feeling as the first time and it was more like why did you just talk to me about this for an hour. I think she gets it (she even said ?you?re overthinking confuses girls? and she kind of chuckled). I apologized for being dumb and said I love you and we hung up. She texted me after saying she loved me and completely understands everything and it doesn?t change how she feels about me or what i am (she is so delicate with her words). And I responded saying I wasn?t anxious and never needed to be and I loved her a lot. However this conversation just made me feel dumb and like I killed a very special moment and came off as confused and put doubts in her head. It felt like I was further from her then before and whatever special connection we made was undermined by my silly overspeculation and over thinking and explicit over sharing of details. I?ve realized since that being vague is key to delicate subjects like this especially when someone you love is involved if you want to keep a sense of magic and mutual energy?we were off the same page it felt like and I learned a hard lesson. For some reason I also felt less comfortable with myself after having this round of questioning and I?m just yearning to get back to where we were that first night feeing so confident and ok with each other being ourselves. Now I fee like I?m policing myself a little bit again about my behavior and how she?s viewing me or at least in my head about it (like ?does she think I?m checking that guy out and want to suck his d***??) kind of thing. I saw her today and everything feels ok but not like last weekend and I?m definitely in my head about the whole thing a lot now.

Sorry for the long disclosure but basically I?m wondering if I really messed up by making that call, what is really going in her mind about the whole thing, and how can I make it right. I feel confident and comfortable with what I am deep down at this point and my anxiety and overthinking has somewhat tainted that and I believe put doubts in her (and my) head about my integrity and confidence. How can I get back to where we were that first night. I definitely learned my lesson about over talking and my gut instinct is to resist the urge to clarify things again?what my overthinking brain wants to do is say something like ?I?m sorry for being confusing and I wish I hadn?t called you it was the anxiety talking and I regret making speculations about irrelevant things, the bottom line is i am not sure what I would or wouldn?t enjoy in terms of experimentation and I?d rather just focus on you and take things as they come.? Or something like that but deep down I also know that will add fuel to the fire of confusion and overthinking. Basically I feel I?m at an impass where I messed up a beautiful moment of clarity and intimacy and if I speak more it will get worse but if I don?t say anything she will keep the harbored doubts and still see me as pretty confused. I just want that magic and comfort back and don?t know what to do!

He thought his mom was perfect and didn't believe me when I told him things she had said to him. She also is obsessed with him and wants whoever he is with to do everything for him, just like she would do (she already went to his house after I left and did dishes and cleaned for him...he is 27 years old!!!!). he is lazy, messy, fights really dirty, judgmental and critical, thinks his parents are perfect and better than mine because they have more money. He was mean to me on many occasions, criticizing me. After 3 years of dating he suddenly said I would never be able to stay home with my children (which I expressed *from the beginning* that I ***might*** want to do. I may hate being at home with kids and run back to work as fast as I can. But I want to know that I can make my own choice about that). He was selfish sexually. he gaslights. He would twist my words about his mom and say I was manipulating him or ""making things up"". he has some sort of depression/mood disorder and he was miserable 90% of the time. he is a huge stoner which would be fine if he wasn't lazy AF, completely unmotivated, and generally miserable. I don't drink and he can't handle his liquor and honestly he *shouldn't* drink, but he does! He got drunk and called me a c\*nt in public on 2 separate occasions. He called his precious mommy at 3am to complain about me once when he was drunk (December). He ran away from me in a foreign city (a few months ago now). He tried to break my stuff (November). The last 3x he went out drinking he didn't get super drunk, but I feel like the damage was done and I would forever be worried about him whenever he is near alcohol. Though he did come home last weekend and try to start an argument. Criticizing my parents, saying they were bad parents because of how one of my brothers turned out.  Saying they were not happy or successful because they don't have as much money as his parents do. HE IS 27 AND LIVES IN A HOUSE  BOUGHT BY HIS PARENTS because his mother has convinced him ""he *can't* make it on his own, he would *never* get approved for a mortgage"" which is complete BS as long as he had a downpayment, he has had steady work for years with the same company. But I 100% believe that she ants to keep him dependent (it may even be subconscious) His mom is subtly controlling and so obviously needs to feel needed. Like she has to take care of him (which ofc prevents him from growing up) and take care of her husband so she feels needed. Maybe she has daddy issues and so in her home she does *everything* (cooking, cleaning, finances, shopping, laundry, you name it she does it. he doesnt have to do a damn thing except fix the odd thing in the house), so she is *needed*. Whatever it is its fked up and she started lecturing me about how I had the closets organized and the cars parks and how I didn't weed the garden enough. Well, now that I am gone I can *guarantee* that her baby son isn't going to do any of that stuff, he lives like a lazy pig, but she just chides him a little. I had to get the 2 hour lectures because everything has to be perfect for her *baby bear* (yes, she calls her grown son baby bear. And she says ""awww, baby bear"" to him). I WILL NEVER DATE A MAMA'S BOY AGAIN FML. But she is so subtle about it. Like she talks the talk of letting him be independent and she did all this stuff for him ""because she loves him"" but like, when you love your kid you don't want them to remain dependent on you and basically incapable of adulting. Because nobody will want to date and especially not marry your lazy, entitled, selfish, moody, incapable child. He literally said he didn't care about buying his own house and building equity because his parents are going to give him everything. Oh yes, great idea. Let's live in your parents house for the next 30 years until they die. In the meantime, your mom can tell me how to decorate, how often to weed the gardens, how to park the vehicles in the driveway, what to put on our shelves, how to organize the closet, how much stuff to have in the basement storage room, etc. etc. etc. That sounds like a life in hell.  


Even writing this is making me angry with him. SO WHY AM I SO SAD and why do I miss him when really I should probably hate him. Why do I cling to that *tiny* bit of good and cry over it like it's some huge loss?? We aren't even compatible in terms of what we want in life. We don't share the same beliefs or values.  I hate partying, he apparently loves it. I have some anxiety and I like to feel safe and protected in the world and I don't feel that way at all. He has been a selfish child and I think maaaaaybe he is JUST starting to grow up, but it's too late for me. The resentment is there. Maybe I am sad because I know he has a good heart in there somewhere and he will probably grow up and become this amazing man and I will never get to be with that person?

My father lost his job a few years ago, and since has been on a downward spiral of drinking. It progressed from evenings,  to all day, to starting at 4, to being drunk literally 24/7. 

I have been off at college, and every time I come back for breaks he seems to be worse. He refuses to see any doctors, and the last time he was at one he refused any treatment or further testing. He sits on the couch all day and drinks, watches tv and goes on facebook. Attempts to get him to go out walking are pointless, and his girlfriend (F30's) gets him his alcohol (if she doesnt he verbally/semi-physically abuses her, i have had to step into this in the past.)

He acts as if he has dementia. He forgets conversations while you are having them, calls people and forgets what he wanted to speak to them about, and refuses to do anything for himself (getting himself food, showering, etc. etc.). He has mood swings and gets angry at the twitch of a hat. He yells and screams and threatens anyone who says anything he doesn't like, and then forgets what he was upset about and gets angrier at the person for making him upset. 

He is greatly losing his ability to walk, he frequently falls and i fear that one of these days he will trip down the stairs and break his neck. Also, recently, he has been losing bowel control and has been pissing on the floor and shitting in random places around the house. It is bad.

He has always been a nasty person, and I don't like him but this should not be.

Does anyone know what I can do, or any way to try and help him get help when he forgets what we're talking about when we try and have a conversation about this?

What can I do?

Yes there is good reason for people fighting in relationships, but there?s a difference between fighting over certain issues and fighting over every little thing. And when your partner carries on and on about something when you?ve made it clear how sorry you are and that you understand why they?re upset, I think that?s a red flag for abuse. And when you say you?ll be better. Even if it?s something so little that they?re mad about. 

I (20F) was with my first boyfriend (M20) for 3 and a half years. With his depression and all of the things he?s been through, it was honestly taken out on me. And he?s even admitted it. I?ve been so insecure after all of the things he?s said to me, all of the names he?s called me. 

People don?t understand what it?s like, why people don?t just leave a relationship like that. It?s really hard to when your partner ends up putting fights in the past, at least for a little while, and gives affection and when you see the other side of their personality that you were so familiar with during the beginning of the relationship. When it doesn?t seem like you have to walk on eggshells. It?s also hard to leave when what they?re saying logically makes sense, yet everyone else around you is saying they are just trying to fight.

I finally broke things off over a month ago and I feel so alive. There?s a guy I went on a date with last night, that I?ve had a crush on a while at work, and it?s so great enjoying another person?s company with good conversation and things in common. 

Don?t be scared to leave that toxic relationship. Whether they are mentally or physically abusing you. Don?t stay in a toxic relationship because you?re comfortable and are afraid of change. You might be the happiest you?ve ever been.

Some backstory for my relationship: My gf and I have been dating for about 2 years now. We know pretty much everything there is to know about each other and our relationship has been mostly stable. Our sex life is generally pretty good and I love her a lot.

This is more specifically about myself though since there's one secret about myself I haven't ever told her about. Plain and simple, I like furry porn and roleplay. I don't go any further than that though, I don't have a fursona, I don't have a fursuit, I don't buy porn, and I don't wan't to take any of that side into the bedroom. It does not define me by any means, but it repesents about 90% of the porn that I watch. I have folders saved of the porn and various accounts across the web of porn sites where I look at it. I definitely have an unhealthy addiction to looking at it sometimes, but that's beside why I am here today.

I'm really here to ask more about the roleplay aspect of it. I tried it once when we were in different states for a week and she treated it like a joke so I held off. Why it gets me going I am not sure, but it does. Whenever I do roleplay is on Omegle or Kik but I don't show my face/penis or have any romantic interest with any person I talk to there. I also don't save anything people send me unless if it is furry art I like. I just enjoy pretending to be a furry character and having online sexual dialogue with someone. I change my account often so that clingy people leave me alone and have never made any contact with these people for longer than a few days (of which it is all rp/sexual dialogue).

Of course, this is all unbeknownst to my gf.  I don't do this too often, the need to roleplay comes and goes, but I have done it enough times to where I don't know if it's become immoral to tell her or not. It's not one of those things where you mention it on the first date or first time in bed, but probably sometime before you die right? I don't really know what to expect if I told her. Like we're at a stage where we can pop each other's pimples, I don't know what kind of shock would happen if I told her any of this. Sometimes I feel wrong for not saying anything, but other times I know I am not persuing anyone and just have a kink that overwhelms my sexual thoughts. 

I know that there will already be a slew of comments from that calling me a degenerate dog fucker or something vile. I already stated earlier that I am very lowkey with this, I don't have anything affilated to furries other than downloading porn and doing roleplays. I don't find that part let alone anything feral-like attractive at all, so please just focus on the part I am asking about.

Throwaway of course...

TL;DR My favourite professor seems to be very nervous around me, act differently towards me than to others. People noticed and pointed it out to me. I don't know if he has feelings for me, but I am in a relationship.

&#x200B;

So, just to eliminate this reaction. I am talking about a university prof, at a graduate part. There are no penalisations for a student-prof relationship. I am a 24(F), prof is 35(M). So to the situation...

I go to a small but prestigious university, and am finishing my grad studies, with hopes for a post-grad, and maybe an academic career. The tiny size of my part of faculty means that mostly everybody knows everybody, people across levels and positions are friendly, and because I am generally accepted to be a promising student, most profs know me by name.

For a few semesters I have been taking various seminars with Nice Professor, I'll call him NP. NP is a young very shy guy, but a total rising star in what he's doing. He is clearly passionate about what he is doing, so his lectures are extremely interesting, and I soon realised I was seeking them out. The system here is that most seminars are open to all years and levels, so I would slowly become one of the most experienced students in some of them, and realised, that I am the only one amused by NP's inside jokes. I did not think much of it at first, but then I noticed that NP keeps a lot of eye contact with me whenever he is talking. I am always actively listening and reacting, so a lot of professors would use me as the face in the crowd, NBD. But then one of my colleagues even commented after I came late and sat in the back ""You have to come in time girl, NP just cut the front rows to talk directly to you.""

After this, I started noticing it too. NP would talk directly to me and react to my facial expressions. Example: a disgusting subject, I make a bit of a face, NP goes ""I know, sorry, let's pass over it quick."" ;or professional inside joke, NP looks at me, I smile, NP smiles back before continuing etc. He talks to me in the hallway sometimes, we share a ton of interests, but is always extremely nervous, fidgeting, and strangely enough, not keeping any eye-contact.

I have mentioned this to another colleague, something like ""NP should get more confident, he is really good at what he's doing."" and my colleague replied with apparent surprise ""I think he's just fine, most times I've talked to him, he was a total showman."" So I looked into it and started noticing that yes, I seem to make NP nervous. He talks with other students in a way calmer manner. Moreover, I went to shake his hand after a consultation, and he dropped his books. He almost tripped over me to open the door for me at least twice. Don't get me wrong, I have all the professional admiration for this person, and also think that he is a great guy, but I am engaged. I have also heard that NP is in a long-term relationship.

I have intentionally mentioned my wedding when NP asked how I'm doing recently. He stuttered, and then really awkwardly congratulated me. The first half of that following lesson, he did not talk to me or look at me.

So, does my professor have feelings for me? Am I just making him nervous somehow? Am I reading it completely wrong? He does not make me feel uncomfortable, but I don't want to get into an awkward situation or in an extreme case, seem like I strung him along. Should I start avoiding his lectures/seminars? Am I an asshole for still enjoying his seminars?

490,Searns,Non-Romantic,6,c6p83q,9,"Alright, I (m25), am extremely uncomfortable with physical touch. It's not even that I was traumatized or anything like that, I just grew up in a house that didn't show affection that way often. Recently I joined a group of friends (20s-30s, mixed genders) and one of the first conversation topics we had was around my dislike of physical contact. (They are friendly, and I told them that I prefer not to hug people.) It took a few nights to get the point across as they seemed to not believe me? And when they finally understood that I don't like physical contact, they seemed hurt and more distant, as a result.

They seem to believe that there are studies around physical contact that would suggest it's nearly impossible to grow attachments to people without physical contact. That being said, I had to tell them multiple times that I don't prefer contact. Even now, one of them still touches me as a joke when we're heckling each other, knowing I don't like it (not in a harassing way.)

All this to say that it's a much different environment than I'm used to. I usually make friends with other nerds who are relatively anti-social. We bond over our shared interest and keep to ourselves mostly outside of the shared interests. As a result most of my interactions with people are almost entirely non-physical, and I thought this was pretty standard for making friends. Is hugging and other forms of affection common for new friends? Am I wrong in my way of thinking? I'm receptive to changing, I just feel extremely uncomfortable when I'm in close proximity to others.

Similar to other posts I?ve seen here before, my girlfriend and I (dating for 7 years now) started in high school. We went to the same university, lived separately with roommates through school and two years after. We now live together, and each step forward has felt comfortable and just right. We are our only partners we?ve ever had, discussed eventual marriage, and up till recently, have been on the same page with being together for the long haul. I love her with all my heart and feel that she?s the ?one?.

Lately I?ve felt like the little persistent fear of only being intimate with one person has been growing for both of us. I?ve certainly had insecurities of not experiencing what it?s like to be single or date other women in my 20s, and both of us have found came to the conclusion that grass is greener where you water it, and not necessarily on the other side.

Yet I feel like for the first real and noticeable time, that fear is bringing us slightly apart. She recently brought this up, wondering to me if we really know who we are if we haven?t been alone without the other for an extended period of time. There?s been other signs too outside of discussion. It seems that she?s spending more time with work friends away from the office (totally fine with me, I want us to have our own lives and social circles), and my gut tells me something is off. I?m wondering if that?s related to all this or I?m looking too deep into it.

What I haven?t seen on this sub is solutions for working through this while staying together. I completely get that breaking up might be where this is headed, but I can?t get there yet. I love her too goddamn much to get to that reality in my head, and I want to hear any ways other couples out there have been able to get over this rut together. Did any specific discussions help? Different activities to break up any routines? More space alone or with other people?

And if the real underlying solution here is a break-up, well I guess I need to hear that too. I just know, or want to know really, that there?s gotta be something else to dedicate my efforts to and make this work.

492,snapplepie612,[new],1,c6p3nl,0,"Ok... idk what to do.

i made a post earlier about how i have recently been hooking up with this guy (who i met on tinder) and i was starting to catch feelings for him. Well... now that may have changed...

It all started this morning, i woke up super late and was just checking up on social media. I saw one of my friends (who happens to be friends with my FWB) retweeted something funny about dogs. I went to the account of the funny tweet...lets call her grace... and decided to stalk (as usual). There wasnt much interesting on there besides some raunchy tweets that i laughed at. As i continued to scroll i noticed that she kept talking about this boy who happened to have the same name as my FWB.. lets call him jerry. There were only a few where she said his name and then a handful of indirect tweets....

The tweets would say ""cant wait to see jerry..."" ""cant wait to hold jerrys hand"" ""i just wanna kiss jerry"" .""i miss \*tags jerry\*""

some of the indirect ones would say ""i havent been this happy in my life"" ... and just random ones about catching feelings

I clicked on one of the tweets where she was talking about him and i had noticed that he liked the tweet... which gave me a bad feeling... turns out he liked all the tweets that mentioned his name.... so i kinda figured there was something going on.... especially bc the tweets were from early may-early june... the latest one being 6/10 and thats around when we started talking...

I ended up going over to his twitter to see if there was anything but nope..nothing.. just seemed like a single boys twitter. The only way you could have ""found"" her was by going through his twitter likes

I decided to head over to insta and check out his page which i do happen to follow and there wasnt any pictures with her or any comments on his photos from her... i found her page through his followers and hers was the same... nothing with him on it...i figured out that they went to the same school so i concluded that is how they met (or on tinder)

At this point, i really dont know what to do. There isnt any clear evidence that they are currently dating (she hasnt tweeted about him since 6/10) but there isnt anything on her twitter about breakups or shit like that (she posted alot about her emotions so if something had happened i thought she would post about it)....We have hooked up a few times and i have mentioned after hooking up hes kinda weird and distant and i didnt know what to think of it. But what really confused me is how he told me that he hasnt done anything with anyone in awhile...

Im really not one to ask someone straight up if they have a gf... especially if i would have to explain how i would know... so should i stop talking to him? (or should i just cut him out of my life completely?) and does he actually have a gf or did they break up??

I am one to overthink things and i would feel bad just ignorning him especially after hooking up with him 2 days ago...

494,difficulthouseguest,[new],7,c6p32l,3,"Posting from a throwaway as the people involved use Reddit. I (29F) moved overseas a few years ago, and I live with my partner (32M) in a small apartment. I talk on the phone occasionally with an old college friend (32F) of mine, and a few months back she told me she wanted to fly out to visit and see the country we live in. I thought why not, it?ll be nice to see her (it?s been a few years since I last saw her). 

We don?t have much space, which I told her, yet she really wanted to stay for about 2 weeks. She wanted to travel around the area too, so I took time of work to show her around and make two long-weekend trips with her. She?s been sleeping on our sofa for the last week now, and she is driving me insane. I know I?m dumb for saying she could stay this long, but now I don?t know what to do because she?s just not the person I remembered. 

First example: we have a cat who is nervous around new people because he?s a rescue cat (I told her this in advance). The cat has hissed at her a couple of times because he doesn?t know who she is, but he hasn?t bitten or scratched her (I highly doubt he would either, he?s a great cat), and yet she will not stop telling me how much she dislikes him! She even asked me to lock him in our bedroom overnight because she ?can?t sleep knowing he?s around?, even after I told her no because his food, water and litter box is in a different room. She has a cat herself so I?m really surprised she asked me to do this. 

Second example, she did offer us money for letting her stay, but I didn?t take it (I don?t feel right charging a friend for sleeping on our sofa), and she offered to do some housework. I said not to worry about housework (I?m a clean freak, so I?d rather just do it myself, plus I don?t want to make her clean when she?s on vacation). However, she?s not cleaning up after herself, which is frustrating, and she?s insisted on splitting the grocery run and the few meals out we?ve shared to the exact penny (this is despite us saying to help herself to food from our fridge, use our washing machine, shower etc, which she has been doing).  

Third example -  she talks over us all the time during any conversation, she seems moody/passive aggressive nearly all the time (like when I didn?t lock my cat in our room all night...), and she?s come out with some really bigoted statements. She even used a homophobic slur the other day! 

All of this had been going on while I?m frantically trying to catch up on work I?ve missed because i took time off to spend time with her. We?re supposed to be making a three day trip to a nearby city next week (which will make me even more behind on work), and I honestly do not want to go anymore - i?d actually rather spend those days in the office than with her. I feel like my partner and I haven?t had a moment away from her as she?s always wanting to do things, and frankly I don?t have the energy often times after I?ve got off work for the few days I?ve been there this week. 

Lastly, I am having to put everything (gas money, food etc) on my card with the promise that she?ll PayPal me the money back to her (which I think she will) - she didn?t bring much cash and apparently her card charges excessive fees if she uses it in this country. She didn?t tell me this beforehand, and the money?s really adding up. She?s transferred some of the money back to me, but so far I?ve been the one keeping track of the tab, and she?s made no offer yet to pay me back for what I?ve paid for, which is just all round awkward. 

Basically, I?m starting to feel like she?s freeloading off of us and taking advantage. I want to get out of this trip, but I feel bad not going when we have things booked already. Would I be a terrible person if I didn?t go on the trip? I have no idea what to say to her to get out of it either. Any advice would be much appreciated please, thank you!

Probably going to come off poorly here but Im looking for advice.

My girlfriend of 3 yrs and I are very close. We have been talking about marriage even. But yesterday we  were discussing finances. She works as a personal trainer and the topic of our incomes came up. I found out she makes  35k. For reference I make about 3x that.  Currently we split all joint expenses evenly which works well because I am an agressive saver and fine with doing low cost and frugal things.

My concern is that if we were to get married, I would effectively serve as the breadwinner in our relationship. I dont know if Im comfortable with that dynamic, and maybe it sounds bad but Im also afraid her low income would basically hold us back from doing things like traveling, retirement goals, providing for our children etc.

I outright asked her if she has thought about looking for higher paying positions and she basically said she is happy with her job and salary. She is not the most ambitious person when it comes to her career, so Im afraid that it will basically be my burden to provide for our family instead of a 'team' effort.

We had some really rough times early on, and more rough times about 6 months ago.  She isn't always an honest person. 

When we first started dating, I had been single for almost 10 years.  Going from casual relationship to casual relationship - because I am very picky about who I spend my time with.  I'm an attractive dude, in great shape, have a great job, charming.  I am a little full of myself, but have grown up especially the last 2-3 years.  

She wanted to remain contact with an abusive ex, I didn't want her to.  Told her it was a dealbreaker for me.  Was it a little hasty for me to say that?  Yes, probably.  But, She lied and said she would cut him off - she didn't.  We fought a bunch about it - but I really connected with her, so I wanted to press on.  Since then the trust has been iffy, but for the most part I do trust her.

Except the times she goes cold on me.  We text, **alot**, during the day (almost the only time we spend apart from each other)  I haven't seen the numbers, but we must exchange 40-50 texts per day at least.  I enjoy it, she's my best friend and we talk a whole lot.  Except when we don't.

A few weeks ago she went away for a business trip.  During the day we text like normal, but then the texts drop off at night.  Like, I'll send a text at 9pm and not get a response until 10am the next day.  It's unusual for her to not respond.  So while I'm at home I'm trying to convince myself that I'm overthinking it - she's out with her coworkers at a bar or something and probably not checking her phone.

But - then it gets under my skin.  It's not like her to go silent on me.  As a matter of fact, if I take a long time to respond (1-2 hours or more), she'll send a text along the lines of ""Babe?""  

But when I text her and she doesn't respond, it's no big deal to her.

It's really hard to judge whether or not I should be trusting of her when these ""Cold spells"" happen.  And they happen nearly every time she goes out, or goes away.  While I don't think she is doing anything behind my back - it does make it seem like I am simply not a priority in her life.

TLDR; boyfriend had completely unfounded jealous outbreak over Facebook comment from way back ex and now I feel like my image of my confident man is ruined.

I (33f) have been dating my boyfriend(34m) for about 2 months now and things have been amazing between us. He's incredibly sweet and emotional and I could feel things growing between the two of us.

I noticed he is a little bit insecure, and so I have been trying to make him really feel special and letting him know how much he means to me.

We had a wonderful night on Wednesday and I felt very close to him, I could feel the emotions brewing between us that night. when he left to go home, I had a huge smile and nothing but happy thoughts of him in my head.

Well Thursday was a completely different story.. It all started on Facebook. He and I both belong to a group which is a hobby we both share. I didn't know that one of my ex's (from when I was 16) was also a member of this group. I made a public comment on the group, to which this ex (which I hadn't spoken to in over a decade..) replied to. 

Now my boyfriend found out, and I openly told him it was an ex from way back in the day and he went completely jealous on me. He was trying to say that the guy was ""blowing up my phone"" (he wasn't..) and that I tried to block him from reading the comments on the post (I didn't...)

So in the evening we had a phone conversation about it and he kept bringing up the fact that he was sure I did something to the post so he couldn't see the comments..I kept telling him the issue was with his insecurity, not a stupid Facebook post and he just kept holding on to it. In the end I asked him if he trusted me and he said ""I don't know""...

Now I'm feeling really.. Over whelmed by this because I feel like it's ridiculous and we ended up in a huge argument over it where he kept accusing me of doing something to the post.

I'm 18 and I live with my mother and my two siblings. My mom works and attends college. My parents divorced about 7 years ago. Dad had been cheating on mom for years and she had finally decided to move out. She told me the rough reason why (that my dad had cheated for their entire marriage pretty much) and ever since then I've been conflicted. 

I loved my dad and always looked up to him as the best man I could be one day. Soon after we moved out, another woman and her daughter moved in with him. This was around the time I overheard my mom talking on the phone about my dad's other daughter that he had before my sister was born. 

He lives in America now, doesn't help my mom at all financially and I'm at a loss. Many times I feel like I had to pick up the paternal role for my brother who's eight. On the one hand I despise my dad. I hate him with every fibre of my being. And yet I know deep down I can't help but care just a tiny bit. 

This has really messed with my head for a long time and I feel like that on top of other unrelated things has caused my mental health to start plummeting. What do I do? I don't know if I need closure or advice or something else. I don't know how to feel.

He is nice and cute and definitely not a catfish or someone who is looking for just fun. We both are serious. Now comes the real problem. I never had a boyfriend before. And me being so shy as a child/teen did not help at all to my conversation skills. Now I am out of my shell and am more comfortable with speaking to other people, but I still am lacking the conversation skills to have a regular daily based conversations. 

I am talking to him every day, but our conversations are not so bright, or lets say smooth. I do not know what to talk about most of the times. Every time he sends me a text it takes me up to 5 minutes to think about a reply back. And my replies are usually dry and not as fun as I want them to be. This is not related to me being bored of him or anything, but about me lacking the skills to come up with a nice reply. 

There also is another factor that effects our conversations. I am a morning person and he is a night person. I usually like to wake up early in the morning and sleep at a normal hour, while he sleeps at around 3am and wakes up around 12pm-1pm. And also since he is going to collage to become a pilot he usually have practice flights within the day. So I really don't want him to think that I'm boring in the small amounts of time that we speak. 

Some things that I can do is stay awake a little late at night to have more time to talk to him, but I still don't know how to keep a healthy conversation going with him. And I would much appreciate if people who have been through this or have ideas can help me. I really don't want to lose him.

503,imitationandroid,[new],4,c6oiob,1,"TL;DR - Neighbor kids' deadbeat dad just crashed for 3 weeks and they are going to melt down when he leaves. I want to help but don't know the best way.

&#x200B;

For the last few months, I have been spending most of my evenings and some time each weekend at my neighbors' house. The mom, her 3 sons (33, F; 9, M; 7, M; 2, M) and their 2 dogs are always happy to see me and play for a couple hours. It has been so mutually beneficial that I am thinking about moving in with them this fall to help out with the kids and feel a sense of family and community, since my biological family has spread across the country in recent years.

&#x200B;

They had been through a lot before I met them. The dad of the 3 boys had serious addictions problems with alcohol, cocaine, and even heroin, though I think the heroin might have been before the youngest 2 were born. His presence has been intermittent and disruptive at best, damaging, toxic, and violent at worst. The mom suffered severe physical and psychological abuse in the relationship, but still wants her sons to have some father figure present in their lives, to whatever extent may be possible. She was only able to get away from him a couple years ago (when she was 8 months pregnant with her youngest) with the assistance of her affluent mother.

&#x200B;

I am concerned that any time the boys' dad does spend with them will be more harmful than helpful. He showed up almost a month ago saying he was going to visit before starting a new job in the area. Here we are, weeks later, and it turns out to be the case that there was no job after all, maybe a few prospects, but none that panned out in the expected time frame. As a result, he ended up laying around my neighbors' house, getting drunk every day, missing important moments because he was passed out while they were happening. For example, the oldest two learned to swim while he has been here, and he didn't witness a single moment of it. He was supposed to take them to swimming lessons at least one of the days this week so that their mom could attend a free self-defense class, but he got drunk instead.

&#x200B;

He looks like a strong, healthy, clean-cut, potentially hard-working guy on the surface, but hasn't been any of those things lately. He insults the mom and curses at her in front of the kids, brags about his previous arrests and warrants, etc. Took pain pills from the dog who just had surgery because he was ""bored."" and so many other atrocious things. I can tell that he tries to be a bit quieter when I am around and ""on his best behavior,"" so to speak, but he still has no place coming into her house and crashing for weeks at a time, treating her place like a flop house, draining her time and energy, and not making any significant contribution to the household.

&#x200B;

He was supposed to be leaving this Saturday (tomorrow) but now says he will be staying another week. The mom doesn't want to get police involved, because she does use marijuana for chronic pain that developed as a result of the abuse, and is afraid that Child Protective Services will find out and try to take the kids from her. She doesn't want to get the landlord involved, because she is afraid that he will involve the police.

&#x200B;

Every time the dad steps outside for a cigarette or gets up to go to another room, the middle child erupts in tears and says, ""No! You can't leave again!"" Sometimes he takes a deep breath after we say he is just going outside for a moment and then calms down; other times, he is inconsolable.

&#x200B;

I have grown to love these kids so much over the last few months and developed a good friendship with their mom. I am worried for their well-being and want to help, but don't know what to do. Mom & I have talked about taking them on hikes and trips to the public library and other free/affordable, fun, kid-friendly spots to help them stay occupied with healthy activities, but this is going to disrupt their world in such a rough way no matter what.

504,pastagobblin,[new],7,c6ofc9,7,"So this isn't quite as dramatic as the title sounds, but I'm in kind of a weird situation here with my girlfriend of 6 months, who I'll call C. Basically it seems like frequently I'll remember C saying she'll do something (usually stuff around the house) and then later C will claim she never said that. It's always little things that don't seem that important at the time, but it's starting to get on my nerves both because I feel like she's lying about it and because I can't rely on her to do what she says she will. I'm sure occasionally I could misremember or misunderstand her, but it seems like it's happening too frequently for that to be the case every time. Like once or twice a week at least.

For example just the other day I thought C said she would cook dinner. I had cooked dinner the previous night and she enjoys cooking so that would make sense. I also remember her saying ""I'll get groceries"" for said dinner which again makes sense for her to say since she'd been talking about doing some shopping anyway. The next day she asked if I would pick up something else when I stopped at the store. I was confused and told her I thought she was getting the groceries. C said no she didn't say that and there must have been a miscommunication. Whatever, I don't mind getting groceries that much so I just did it. When I got home she also asked me to cook dinner. I again was confused and said I thought she had offered to cook since I cooked last. She again said she never said that and I must have ""assumed"" she would cook. She also said she ""would remember saying something like that."" But I'm like 99% sure she said both those things. It's possible she meant ""get"" the groceries as in pay for them, but she didn't do that either as we split the cost.

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm crazy here but I have no way of proving that I'm not because these are always things she's said verbally that no one else heard. What has me suspicious also is it always seems to benefit her. It only seems to happen when the thing she agreed to do is a chore or something she doesn't want to do. I don't think it's malicious, but I think maybe she changes her mind about doing whatever it is and just doesn't want to admit that. She has kind of a pattern of changing her mind about things and then talking like the new thing was the plan all along, it's just usually it doesn't affect me or if I ask she'll admit to changing her mind. I feel like that could be the case here too but because it's something she's kind of obligated to do it's easier to pretend she never agreed to it in the first place.

How can I talk to her about this or prevent this from happening in the future? Please no suggestions to secretly record her or something because that's illegal in my state, and also I shouldn't have to record my girlfriend to hold her accountable.

506,Mambarii,Personal issues,5,c6odnj,3,"Hi, Reddit. I came from r/AmITheAsshole as I honestly was afraid that I was a bad person. I just need advice on how to move forward.

This post is very messy. Sorry about that ^^""

I am a 17 year old Non-binary (they/them) who has a lot of trouble with anxiety and low self esteem. I'm not the best at communicating.

My family,
(mother, 49
father, 51
younger sister, 9
And older brother, 20)

is quite right leaning and have a lot of issues with me being Non-binary or LGBT+ in general, which doesn't help the low self esteem.

I ended up completely snapping and distancing myself from them after a conversation with my dad about how being LGBT is wrong, how I'm going to hell, and how I'm sick in the head. I've had multiple conversations like this before then, but this one in particular caused a break down in which I tore down all of my pride stuff as silently as I could because I can't be too loud.

For the past few weeks, I've been in a very bad place mentally and want nothing to do with them, so I've been completely disconnecting myself from them. After a few days of doing this, I got several comments and insults along the lines of ""you're in bed too much"" or ""you're not doing enough school work"" which I had given up on as I know basic math and want to get into theatre and writing instead.

I didn't go out to play a board game with my sister and father so I was yelled at, and my phone was taken away. My mother thinks I spend too much time online, and my brother doesn't speak to me anymore, considering it a betrayal that I came out to them.

I  don't play many family games with them much due to how much we argue, I don't sit through movies we watch without getting on my phone or just trying to sleep if the lights are off, I spend most of my days in bed, and I eating has been a difficult task, but I'm doing better.

They've been calling me a jerk, a bad sibling, a bad influence, and have had several rants aimed at me about how I'm wrong for distancing myself and have stopped going to church because my religious beliefs have taken a bad hit due to my parents calling me a sinner.

I have almost completely held myself up in my room, seeing no point in leaving because I do not want to spend time with a family I don't enjoy being around.

I have a few friends online who have been really good to me and I consider them my real family and I'm hoping to crash at their place at some point once I can escape here. Nothing has been made final yet, I still can't drive, and I have one more year before I can legally get out of here.

I'm scared I'm the bad person in this situation. Not wanting to play with my younger sister at all, spending all my time in my room, and more of the things I mentioned. What on Earth do I do to get out of this hell hole?

(Added due to comments on the original post while writing this: someone said I have depression and I might. My mother doesn't believe in anti depressents and the therapist I was seeing, said I needed to accept my birth gender. I've accepted I was born with certain parts and without certain parts and theres not much I can do about that, however, I'm still Non-binary and my Dysphoria is pretty hard to deal with.

Here's my story, our relationship are now about 3 years old. Me and my girlfriend dont have much problems, we share same common interests and many things.

One day, she had a problem with her google account. So she asked me help her recover back her account. Right after I received her account, I accidentally open her Google Keeps. 

From that moments, my heart breaks into pieces knowing that she still had feelings on her ex-bf and still hasn't move on. So I ask her about that, and she said that the notes are all in the past and she has fully move on. Of course I had doubt on her, but I'm trying my best to stay positive because I love her so much.

So today, I try to reopen her Google Keeps (I know I shouldn't have done this, but I just feels like I had to), I found out that she wrote notes about her ex-bf for past few days. She missed all the conversations they had, because of her ex-bf contact her back past few days. And yeah, she wrote that her ex-bf was her forever crush. 

So yeah, now my heart hurts like hell. I've no idea what should I do. But I feels like I had to share this somewhere because I have no one to share it irl . Thanks for spending your time to read my thread :)

Honestly for some reason I just keep looking for reasons that she may be lying or deceiving and I'm not sure why.  She claims very often that she cares deeply about me and shes incredibly thankful for the relationship, and is also the one who wanted to continue the relationship when she decided to move.  She even claims that she will want to move back when her lease is up if it doesn't work out with me looking for a position there (which I honestly don't give a sh\*t where I live).

I kept saying I need to get some work done, then said maybe I will spend the day reading. Eventually she proposed a plan to spend the day together. I finally just said that I feel like I need a bit of alone time today. 

At that point she stopped talking to me and her tone immediately went cold (I was in the shower at the time). Afterwards I kind of said I felt it was unfair that I couldn?t ask for alone time without being made to feel guilty. She blew up about how she didn?t do anything and it?s not her job to make me feel okay when I disappoint her. 

I get her point that she didn?t say anything. But we constantly have disagreements about tone. To me her tone and her stopping talking said enough that she was upset. 

Anyway, afterwards I desperately wanted to talk things through and let her know where I was coming from, and to hear her out. But she refused and now left the house for the day so we will sit with this all day. 

I guess it was unfair of me to call her out on her tone. Fair enough that she doesn?t have to make me feel okay. But what I said was I felt it was unfair that I cant ask for alone time without being made to feel guilty. Is that a crazy ask? I guess I should just accept that if I do ask that, and don?t want to do the plans she is laying out, she will feel bad and I will feel bad and there?s no way around that?

I met my friend Mark about two years ago. I am a transplant in the city I am in and he has lived here his whole life outside of college. I used to work a job where I would transport people to various places and I ended up transporting a person to the place he worked. I would always talk to a cute barista there after the drop-off. One day, Mark was talking to her and he interrupted our conversation to talk to me. I humored him and he asked me to hang out. Since I didn't have many male friends at the time, I agreed and we hung out that weekend. Well, we went out for drinks in a part of town I really hate (overpriced and fratty crowd) and he proceeded to get me super drunk and recorded me being a drunk ass. He ended up showing the barista later and she pretty much stopped talking to me. I called him out on this and he told me that she ""was too much of a hipster for me anyway"". 

&#x200B;

Mark revealed to me that he was gay. Not a problem for me at all. I have several close friends who are gay. However, Mark has some serious issues with the LGBT community, to the point that it is actually causing antisocial behavior. He is very obsessed with the notion of traditional masculinity, calling himself a bro and seeking out other bros. He has ranted on Facebook about how much he hates Pride celebrations, saying that they are forcing ""feminine"" gayness onto everyone. When I tell him to just accept that people are different, he will usually just say ""ugh"". Every weekend he ubers to the fratty bars and drinks alone, hoping to meet other bros. He has a very obnoxious personality and tends to make friends for one night who never end up talking to him again. It's an endless cycle. On top of this, he will sometimes send me screenshots of men on Tinder who he thinks are too ""feminine"", saying that they ""talk like eunuchs"" or are ""dying their hair every week"". To him, an ideal man listens to Dave Matthews, wears baseball caps backwards, and drinks beer all the time. A lot of the men he sends me pictures of are way too young for him. I don't know why he has his age range set to 18+. I've told him that he should probably set the range higher so he can find more mature matches, but he'll just say ""yeah"" and leave it alone. He also had ""no flamers"" in his bio...just not cool.

&#x200B;

On top of this, the rest of his life is just very difficult for me to relate to and I feel like I can't be a part of it any more. He has lived with his parents after college (not a big deal, a lot of people do this to save money), but he has worked for his father the whole time for something like $14/hr. He has tried a few other jobs but constantly states that everyone else was ""an asshole"" or ""just didn't like him"". He told me that they constantly were yelling at him for being late. I feel like there is more here, but I can't really say. Anyway, I helped him enroll in a coding boot camp and this has caused a whole other slough of problems. He has struggled a lot with the material and is constantly asking everyone for help instead of googling things. I know that coding is challenging, but I have encouraged him to search for resources efficiently and not relying on others for answers. He just won't do this and as a result has alienated himself from the peers in his class. After finishing the class, he has expected to find a job right away. He gets incredibly depressed and down on himself when he gets rejected from the interviews. I have offered to look over his resume and give him interview tips, but he either ignores me or refuses. I found a job coding for a short period of time and I had good advice to give, but he won't listen. I know for a fact his resume needs help because I was connected with him on LinkedIn and he listed his movie review blog as professional job experience. I have suggested multiple times he remove it, but he never has. 

&#x200B;

The part that makes this friendship really challenging is that he suffers from PTSD, which I have felt obligated to support him through. The gist of his trauma comes from a date he went on three years ago. He talked to a guy he met for about a week or two and went out on the guy's birthday. They both got really drunk and Mark ordered the guy an uber home. The guy wanted to still drink and he went out walking and got hit by a car and died. Horrible stuff, for sure. Mark has been through five different therapists, quits treatment when things get too emotional (he told me this, not my own speculation), and just continues to do the same things in life. He has a very limited comfort zone and refuses to budge out of it. I am really not trying to discredit his PTSD, but it's just really hard supporting someone like this who will not continue professional help. His trauma makes it hard for him to watch certain movies, to wake up before 9AM, to sleep properly, to focus, and so on. He still has the guy who died on his Facebook account and I have tried to help him delete the guy, but he freezes and changes the subject every time I've tried. I don't know if this is the best way to do things, but I know that when I have had horrible break-ups, deleting my ex was the only way to move on.

&#x200B;

Lastly, he really wants to get out of his parents' house, but he won't make the changes to do so. He won't find a better paying job in the field he is in, he spends all his disposable income on booze, ubers, video games, magic cards, and blu-rays, but won't save any of it. He is rude to his parents who have really given him everything. I just don't know how to help this man. I have tried a lot, and frankly he exhausts me and irritates me all the time, leading to every little thing about him making me resent him. I feel like an asshole, and I probably am, but I can't force this. Am I wrong for wanting to end this friendship or do I just need to re-evaluate it?

I've made a lot of recent progress at my full time job and in some various personal and side-hustle rabbit holes I've gone down. But I unwittingly became co-dependent while thinking I was supporting her through school, trouble at work etc, that seemed like she needed help with. That fact came to a head over a big fight - perhaps our worst - about a week ago. I guess I was wrong. But going forward, even less texts from work, and given my anxious attachment style I've come to realize, given her supportive nature of my various issues throughout - we've been together close to 2 years - I keep thinking negative thoughts. That main reason is that while I am focusing on now finding new ways to exploit my skill (photography) and getting out of my comfort zone with networking events, her going out with her friends or having them over is not doing the same as taking the sailing or language class she wanted. I guess what I'm saying is I need assurance that this new approach by my GF is all support and a bigger look at our relationship. And if possible, and if this situation reminds you of something familiar, any advice on how to make it easier and not sabotage our relationship and find renewed happiness.

517,Alex60134,[new],50,c6nqpm,39,"This is actually not a throwaway, I?ve just never felt compelled to post before.  Entirely new to the interaction, not super new to browsing.

She (I?ll call her S from here) and I have been together for 5 months now. As far as I was concerned, it was the most positive dating relationship I?ve had in a long time, a few years at least.  I think it?s been a fairly serious tone so far, and developed at a normal pace. I?ve stayed over her place several times (I have 2 roommates and not much privacy) and helped her move and get settled in when she bought a house (yay!).  I?ve brought her with me to my grandma?s for dinner a few sundays ago.  That?s the only family either of us have met, but the most important one to me. Our personalities have meshed together perfectly so far, and there?s times I have moments where she says something and I think ?she totally gets it,? and it makes me smile.  She also challenges me and brings me out of my shell on the regular, something I?ve never really allowed myself or others to do.  And it?s been a total blast so far!

One of the things she?s gotten me to do that I rarely did before I met her is going out to clubs/shows, specifically edm/techno to dance and drink.  On one of these nights out this Saturday prior, she and I, along with her friend and her friend?s husband, (both of whom I had just met for the first time) went out to a show.  The DJ we came to see wasn?t going on until midnight, but we went at 10 to start drinking and dancing to the first DJ.  Having a blast again, even though the first DJ was meh, save for the eventual issue at hand.  Around 11:30 I noticed her on her phone and she tells me she got her coworker to come. Cool, the more the merrier, although a little awkward for the coworker since we?re 2 couples, but that?s the coworkers issue, not mine.  If they don?t care, why would I?

She works in engineering, so the odds are this coworker is a guy. I?m indifferent at the time.  Especially since we?ve gone out with other male coworkers of hers before and they?ve all been fun, worry-free nights, I didn?t think twice and still wouldn?t.  

He arrives, not knowing how to introduce myself without her there (she was in the bathroom, but told us what he looked like/his name to flag him down) I refer to myself as her boyfriend.  Gut reaction is that his expression shows surprise, and what I sensed was a shred of disappointment.  In retrospect, some guy showing up solo to a DJ performance at the request of a potentially (from his perspective) intoxicated female coworker at almost midnight is maybe a little odd.  Or maybe he?s just a die-hard party guy. I don?t really know much about him and couldn?t learn a ton in the setting.

The night resumes pretty normally, we drink quite a bit (I tried to slow down my own drinking when I noticed her to be extremely tipsy, just in case).  A couple times during the night S pulls coworker closer to our group when dancing.  He was kinda the 5th wheel, and it wasn?t specifically towards her, so I get it.

At some point in the night, a random stranger says ?you guys are a cute couple? to myself and S.  S is extremely avoidant of PDA, to the point where she?ll rarely even touch me in public.  I never thought much of it, except that it was a little quirky.  I prefer my privacy as well, but mostly out of respect for others, not for anything I feel as a result.  S then expresses frustration that he knew we were together with something along the lines of ?how?d he fuckin know we were a couple!?  We were dancing close but not really on each other at any point, and our semi-circle of 5 was odd numbered, so I was curious as well.  But S sounded mad but seemingly in a casual or joking way.  It struck me as a little bit odd, but I brushed it off at the time.  She is quirky, for sure.  It?s one of the things I really enjoy about her, but this quirky reaction was just somehow weirder.

By 2 the place is really thinned out and we start getting ready to leave. The girls go to the bathroom together.  Coworker and I are waiting for them to come out (other guy also went to the bathroom), and we get ready to leave (closing out our tabs upstairs).  It?s been a while since I?ve seen the girls at this point, so I go back downstairs to find them, worrying maybe one of them was sick.  Apparently they were helping a sick girl in one of the women?s stalls, all good, but mildly sobering for me.

We go outside to meet up with coworker who is already outside.  As soon as we come outside, she goes to hug coworker.   We talk for a minute or 2, discussing our ride situation (we were gonna get a lyft).  Coworker offers to drive.  I?m not really sure he?s sober, but he sounded alright and assured us he was fine. She hugs him again. We?re talking for a few more minutes, but S and coworker have their own convo while the other 3 of us have our own. And in the duration I notice she hugs him a couple more times, unprompted by him as far as I can tell.  I can see coworkers face looking a little like he was worried about my reaction by the 3rd and 4th hug.  So far he?s been a cool dude and he doesn?t strike me as the type to consciously threaten our relationship in any way.  His facial expressions just seemed too honest.  I don?t know how good of a judge I was in my state, so this is just conjecture.

On the walk to the car, myself and the other couple walk side by side, and S walks alongside coworker.  We get to coworker?s car and S sits in front.  I don?t recall much of the car ride but there was a lot of S saying she was best friends with coworker, sounding very drunk.  It seemed vaguely like flirting, but also like drunk rambling.

I?m feeling a little uncomfortable by this point and I think S?s friend spots it in my face, as she asked if I was alright.  I know S had fun, and with her stress level at work, I?m ecstatic to be part of the stress relief with her.  I decide to just keep my uneasy feeling to myself for now with that in mind.

In fact, with how crazy her work has been with constantly traveling for weeks at a time and long hours, I?ve made a concerted effort to just be a positive influence only.  S had told me one night on a date just a few weeks prior that ?for a split second she forgot about all her work stress and was just happy.?  It fucking melted my heart.  Since then I consciously tried to just make things simple and easy and as fun and worry-free as I could for her.

But boy were these hugs not sitting well with me.  She?s oftentimes not particularly affectionate, extremely so in public but also still in private.  It was off-putting the first couple times in private when I realized it early in the relationship, as I interpreted the refusal of my affection as a loss of interest.  It challenged me mentally, and really tested my confidence, as right after she rejected my advance in private (I forget if it was a hug or cuddling or a kiss, one of them) she was traveling for work for 2 weeks.  We stayed in touch through that time just like normal, but I had started to wrestle with whether she was genuinely attracted to me.  This concern was put to rest when she returned and was once again receptive of my affection.  This occurred subsequently, but after that first time, I didn?t care.  When she initiated the affection after that, it was amazing how powerful it felt to me.  Her occasional rejection made it seem so much more valuable when she gave it freely.  I can?t get hugs on command, but boy when I do get them, it?s so damn good.  Despite being an extremely affectionate person, I took no issue with the frequency of intimacy or affection she offered because when she did give it, it was just better.

Until this night.  When she willingly hugged her coworker multiple times, I thought, ?my god what I wouldn?t give for all of those hugs for myself.?  It know it?s silly to be bothered by it, but I?d been rejected, particularly in public but sometimes private, when I went for hugs, or a hand-hold, or a kiss, so many times now, that this bothered me.  It?s admittedly pretty childish, but honest.

With all the context of our relationship and what had happened that night, it all sat wrong with me. On Monday night, I decided I should tell her that it had made me uncomfortable.  I texted her that I needed to talk when she was free, and she called me shortly after.  Unfortunately I think I chose my words poorly in expressing these same concerns to her.  I think I said ?she was sort of all over her coworker? which isn?t true, but in the context of the lack of affection I was shown that night, it had seemed that way.  She was notedly shocked by the recap and the idea that the coworker and her interactions with him made me feel bad.  She seemed to be receptive and understanding, though I don?t believe she apologized.  I don?t really care if she apologizes or not, it wasn?t inherently wrong, but I needed her to know that it made me feel a little uncomfortable to see her freely give a type of affection I was often denied or deprived of by her.  No real resolution is reached in this conversation and we say good night. I apologized for making an issue out of it but explained it was gonna bother me if I didn?t admit the jealousy I felt.

On following day we had previously planned to get together that night, as it was probably our last chance before she goes on a long (6weeks, longest yet) work trip.  It was gonna have to be brief and forced and probably just involve a few hours before we?d have to get to sleep.  When I was pursuing details of the plan she eventually said she?s not sure when she?ll be home.  It?s getting late and I ask if I should still come over, she responds and says no, she still has to pack.

The next morning she?s quiet.  I?m making normal small talk but also asking about her travel details, as I?m unsure about when she leaves.  She doesn?t respond until late afternoon when she says she doesn?t wanna talk right now.  I?m worried, but just tell her to travel safe.

I leave her alone for the rest of that day and the next day, at the end of which I check in, explain I don?t wanna bother if she?s not ready to talk but also explain that I didn?t want her to think she?s not on my mind.  She says we?ll talk soon, that she?ll call but it?ll have to be really late, when her flight lands.  I say it?s fine and that I?ll make myself available when she?s free.  I woke up to a text explaining she was too tired to call, that we?ll talk soon.

Haven?t heard anything since last night.  I?m worried that I rattled her confidence in us a bit. I think she understood it wasn?t a huge issue, but one I couldn?t overlook either.  I think her big concern is that I might want more affection than she?d ever give, which I tried to explain had never been an issue til that night.

Was I wrong to admit it? Should I have let it pass and just tried to deal with my jealousy?  Where do I go from here?  I still believe she and I could have a serious future, but I feel like I forced awkwardness into a really good thing.  Was my jealousy just stupid in the first place?  Is this maybe a greater sign of incompatibility that I was neglecting before now?

Will update if and when we talk.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the advice! A lot of what you kind folks said here was pretty good at helping me evaluate everything.  We had our talk. We?re gonna go full Ross and Rachel and go on a break until she returns in August. We?re staying in touch but no expectations.  We?ll reevaluate our feelings then, if we wish.  Her concern was actually something I had said in a text after our talk, where I indicated that I was ?greedy? about affection in that I?d ?always want more.?  This had raised her concern about ever being able to meet my expectations or needs, and said it would?ve made her feel inadequate if she didn?t give as much as I wanted, which I made sound seemingly infinite with that comment.  Didn?t really realize how I?d phrased this, so I never made the connection.  Really what I?d meant to imply was that I?d never refuse her affection and I?d always take whatever she?d offer, not that I had some lofty and greedy standard she?d be expected to fulfill.  This was her concern, Dude.

Recently I went through a breakup with my ex partner \[23/F\]. We were together for a year and 3/4, we moved in together about 3 months after we started dating, but we have known eachother on and off 4 years. I made mistakes throughout the relationship, I flirted with other people just for the attention and I cheated on her. I feel like an absolute disgrace.

ME :22 

My boyfriend works a lot and his job is pretty stressful, sometimes he goes 2 or 3 weeks with not a single day off.  He?s a very hard worker. But when he comes home from work he just wants to relax and play video games before he goes to sleep. He?s a gamer guy who plays wow and all those pc games. 

We hadn?t seen each other for the past week and a half because of both our busy work schedules and he couldn?t even take time away from his games to hangout with me! I don?t have a problem with the games, I get it it?s a stress reliever, it?s fun , whatever but he knew I was coming over and we hadn?t seen each other in literally the longest amount since we started dating (almost 2 years together ) 

When I?ve suggested things to go out and do his response is he?s too tired or he doesn?t wanna spend money. Ok so I say let?s go for a hike or a walk or something. He very rarely can put the video games down for me. Even in the middle of a bad fight he had to hang up the phone on me to continue his game.  He also says he doesn?t wanna just sit and watch movies with me inside because it?s ? boring ?. 

It sucks when I only get to spend an hour or so with him ( full attention on me ) and then he plays games until he goes to bed. I?ve talked to him about this but he says it?s his only hobby and enjoyment and stress release from work and I just tell him i just want to see him more often but he insists it?s not an issue and basically won?t listen to me. Every time I have the ?talk? it fails.  All he does it work , play games and then barely see me if I?m Lucky. You think he could of planned a nice date after not seeing him for so long but nah, raiding with the boys is more important.

My girlfriend (Daisy, for the sake of this post) is, for the most part, a normal person. I absolutely love her, and love spending time with her. We have plenty of shared interests, personality traits, and get along very well. There are some issues with sex drive (e.g. I don't have one) but it's not a problem, as I'm fine to have sex whenever she wants and I don't resent her for it.

What I resent her for is her seeming inability to mature. We come from very different backgrounds; I'm a lower-middle class, first-generational college student, whereas she's an upper-middle class, nowhere-near-first-generational college student. Every single person in her extended family for three generations has graduated college with a degree, there are multiple lawyers, doctors, etc. and I guess she's used to having things done for her. She doesn't wash dishes by hand, she can't use a computer at all, she's incapable of purchasing her own concert tickets... it's little things that make it very frustrating to meet her halfway. when there's not an issue at hand, it's fine, but the moment some sort of adversity appears, or frustration appears, she either shuts down or lashes out.

Looking for some guidance in approaching her and asking her to figure this out. I don't want to break up with her, but the amount of effort it takes to talk her out of these stupid mental ruts is frustrating. If she doesn't get her way in a few very specific circumstances, she just loses it, lashes out, and then hates herself for the next week. 

I want to be this girl's boyfriend, but I can't be her therapist.

524,chopinaddict_92,Infidelity,20,c6n802,2,"This is my first post ever so forgive me if I'm rambling. This is my second relationship, been together 1.5 years, living together for 6 months. We are very happy together, and want to get married and spend our life together someday.

The sexting started before we moved in together. My bf had been single for 6 years before we got together, and in his last relationship he was cheated on. Since then, he has had a habit of sexting girls, most of the time with no intention of ever meeting them in person. I found out 10 months into our relationship that he has been sexting 4 different girls, 2 he's never met in person, 1 he used to sleep with, and 1 who was and old co-worker that he's only met like 3 times. These were all people he used to sext prior to us being together. Fairly explicit content, sometimes nudes exchanged. None of these ever lead to meeting in real life, and he says it was all talk, and there was never an intention of meeting them. He doesn't even masturbate to the conversation or pictures, he doesn't really understand why he does it. Said he'd never do it again, I forgave him at the time, we moved in together 2 months later, and I thought that had fixed the problem.

I found out last Sunday that he had sexted the old co-worker again. It has been 6 months since it last happened. I was furious. We had a long chat and got down to the core of the problem. Basically it seems like out of the blue he will feel an urge to sext someone, and then he doesn't think about the consequences or how that would make me feel, and it's not until the msgs subsides then he goes ""what the f**k have I done"" and feels extremely guilty. Seems like some form of addiction, and stems from him being cheated on in the past and not having a good self esteem, and needing a confidence booster. 

He truly wants to change, and I 100% believe him when he says he never had the intention of actually meeting them, that it was all talk. And I do believe that in the future, he is very unlikely to physically cheat on me as well. We are working on strategies to stop this from happening, and he is willing to go to personal counselling to work out why exactly he is doing this and how to stop. 

I love him so much and would feel like it's the end of the world if we broke up. But at the same time I'm very sceptical that he will ever change. I also kind of hate myself for not breaking it off already, I guess I think because it's not physical cheating and he doesn't even masturbate to it, if we can work through it it'll be worth it. Please give me advice, whether it be if you think I should leave, if there's a chance things would work out, and if we are to work on it how can we move past this? Has anyone else gone through something similar and are still with their SO?

All my red flags and gut feelings seem to come from differing beliefs , mainly what a healthy relationship is and if we are truly compatible.  We have not been able to have this conversation because I fear it is a form of my depression and self-sabotage.  Or, when it is brought up, it seems to be met with a panicky self-preservation feeling where whatever the issue is we need to fix it to save us.  Even then, I get uncomfortable and feel like alarms are going off in my head like I am accommodating and attempting to serve the needs of my partner and the path of least resistance which is to remain exuberantly bubbly and lovey dovey.

&#x200B;

Quick preface; I was interested, asked for a couple dates but never worked out then pursued at the behest of my shrink who believed the stability and support would help me. We see each other once a week on average, have relations far less, we have a 'special relationship that doesn't need those things as much', I think I do and I think she isn't into it. We live a 30 min drive apart, work 9-5s about 1.5hrs apart, been dating for \~8 months, it's her first real relationship, she's a ball of anxiety at all times and needs a lot of emotional support and encouragement which is fine but really taxing. We are two very different people. My sports / red meat / career driven / capitalistic / occasional vices / adventure and risk taking / independence / like personal time and space / social drinker and socializer. Her; Yogi / everyone love everyone / not a drinker / bed by 10p latest / moon crystal / meditation / vegetarian when we met, now chicken and fish ok / natural remedies / no microwave / family person (cannot fathom living in a different region) / anti politics (hates discussing or even hearing a TV mention any political topic, but still has extremely polarized views and defends them with her emotions like they make her who she is) and hates her great office job because the environment is catty (fashion corporate office) and her calling may be the yoga she is now certified to instruct.

So I wrote the below paragraph earlier on and then decided to put together a rant of traits because I can't communicate my thoughts/feelings/views well:

I feel like our relationship was something I needed while I climbed out of a depressed stage of my life. I actually asked her out to drinks a few times but always had schedules conflict. My persistence was driven by the meetings I was having, which emphasized the benefits of a relationship but in a surprisingly selfish way now that I think about it. Eventually it worked out and I think we have been having a great time, but a lot of things about 'us' . There has been some travel but the more we plan another trip the more I have been feeling that we haven't actually connected or bonded the way a relationship should and she recently asked me, ""What are we working towards"" which was a leading question looking for me to say a family or something indicating marriage or something. This question got me thinking, what are we working towards? I cannot land on an answer. Hell we have slept in the same bed less than 15 times, which includes our last three trips together, so how can i imagine what moving in together would be like?

She truly is a loving person, maybe so much that it is throwing me off. I have not set any boundaries because they seemed to hurt our relationship, but it is getting crazy in my opinion. Every single day, on our individual commutes, we will talk on the phone the whole time, both ways. If I say I need some quiet time (I love driving and the chance it gives me to rock out, think or just calm down) during one of these commutes then I can tell it sets off some flag in her head that I may be growing weary or something is wrong and she has done something or not done something etc etc etc. Honestly, I have been getting weird feelings and have been noticing how many times a day she texts, g-chats, mentions 'I love you' like they're status checks and if I don't reply with one it feels like she's noticing and hurt or concerned by it. It feels like puppy love, which is adorable, but really giving me the willies.

These emotionally dissonant moments keep popping up. Like the persistent professions of love, which felt good and right in the honeymoon phase are looking like red flags now. I am not sure why I feel so crossed up about us I cannot see the path ahead and it's really annoying because on paper we could be an amazing couple. She is someone who impresses me, is very fit, kind and open heart-ed with big aspiration in helping others through her yoga. She would be an awesome partner in life but there is this weird gut feeling and sometimes when I am worn down it really gets to me. Mind you this is all coming from a confused and self attributed 'directionless mind' that has been the bane of my self-worth for my whole life, but something inside me is saying we are not right and I don't know if that thing is right or if it's me being self destructive and an emotional pugilist.

So, there is my rant. I've reviewed my feelings with close friends, had talks with family and even flip flopped with the doc; from planning to break it off to taking the ""well it ain't broke"" mentality which feels a little complacent now. Now I am coming to reddit because I had planned to break it off before the weekend (no reason just need to decide something by sometime) and now she is coming to the parent's today and wants to see each other sometime this weekend and I feel like an asshole if I do this while she is at my parent's house.

Am I at least right in saying I'm pretty lost? /s

Am I an asshole for feeling like there is someone more right out there for both of us?

So at my job we work in teams of three. There's one supervising person and two who work under them. I currently supervise two guys. We have to work together, sometimes one on one for days at a time. The company has several of these teams.

A couple days ago, one of the guys I supervise started using every available chance he got to touch me. Anytime he was within reach he'd reach over and pat me on the back. Now, this would be annoying under normal circumstances but I have haphephobia (fear of being touched), and I'm especially afraid of being touched by men. Needless to say, I wasn't feeling great about it. He did it around five times in two hours while I was just trying to work. I was pretty much trapped in the work room until the end of the day so I couldn't just walk away, and I tried to avoid giving him the opportunity to keep reaching over and touching me, but I'm partially deaf so he just kept sneaking up on me.

At the end of the day I sort of wrote it off as weird behavior that maybe I was making too much out of because of my phobia, but he did it again the next morning. Then as we were leaving for lunch he blocked the exit of the room I was in and confessed that he had a huge crush on me and asked me out. I told him I wasn't interested. I'm also gay, but didn't mention it at the time because I was too weirded out. Unfortunately since he picked the middle of the day for this, I had to go back to work with him for the next four hours. It was extremely awkward.

The next day I wound up having to tell my own supervisor what had happened because I started having a mild anxiety attack at the thought of having to work so closely with him after that. My supervisor spoke to HR and they both think I need to have a one on one conversation with the guy to ""clear the air"" and then keep working with the guy on my three person team. The thought of talking to him about it again is really stressing me out and I don't really want to have to work one on one with this guy every day now. What should I say/do?

TL;DR One of the guys I supervise started touching me all the time, then confessed his love and asked me out while I was trying to work. I shot him down, but now I'm really uncomfortable around him and my boss wants me to talk to the guy and make it less awkward.

Problems began at 12 where they would constantly mock me for my pudgy stature I accumulated from their ""rich"" home cooking and restrictions of activity, in response I spent time working on my physique in the sunlight (local gym didn't allow kids), causing my skin tone to darken 

This caused them to mock me for my darker skin as it was seen as a negative sign of beauty (even though they are both of brown skin tones), to this day I'm still mocked for my deep brown skin tone, it breaks my heart as it makes me feel isolated from my entire family

I have a receding hairline which I am super self concious about, which is why I sport an undercut with bangs, this hairstyle is seen as a style for delinquents in my culture causing my parents to constantly shave it down to a buzzcut, a hairstyle I never was on board with and despise

I am sort of a black sheep in the family due to my brother [M22] having all the traits my parents love, he's 6'2, light skin and sports a short hairstyle because of his strong hairline whereas I have none of these traits

I am sensitive in which I shower my parents in unconditional love and affection, however they usually do not reciprocate as they shower my brother with constant love despite him not showing 1/10th of the love I do

I'm tired of it all, they constantly knock down all self confidence I have with their snarky comments which usually reduces me to silent tears behind closed doors, no matter how many times I try to defend myself they refuse to listen to their own son, I don't know what to do because I just can't tolerate it anymore, I just want to be myself

We have talked a little about mental health, but not really dove deep into it - our friendship was centered around more positive things most of the time. I developed a crush on him about 2 months ago.

I bit the bullet and asked him out yesterday, especially as I thought I saw signs that he might be into me too. He said no, but I'm still processing the exact reason why and I'm not sure what to do. He said he likes me a lot, and treasures our friendship, and he's really glad to have me in his life. He said he's flattered that I fancy him. He said under normal circumstances, he probably would have agreed to a date too, since he thinks I'm ""that great."" But that it's not me, it's him.

He said he's going through a lot of personal mental health issues that he doesn't broadcast to world or even most of his friends, but ones that would absolutely derail a relationship at this stage. He told me he was suffering from heavy depression the past few years, and told me about a previous relationship he had. At the time, his previous gf told him it was no issue, that she would support him, and things kind of worked for a few months. But he ended up treating his gf (unintentionally) as his therapist and his caretaker, and she got totally burned out and they had a terrible breakup. He said he's not mentally healthy enough to enter into a new relationship and have him and his potential gf be total equals. He's been undergoing therapy to try to get better, but it's been tough and his progress has been slow at times.

He said because of his unresolved personal issues, he thinks it would be unfair to enter into a relationship with me. That I might say ""it's not an issue"" now, but it will become one down the line. He wants to improve on himself and get better mentally before being willing to date anyone romantically. He also said that he was dealing with a lot more, but didn't feel comfortable opening up to me yet. But he said as long as I was okay with it, he would love to continue being friends with me and having me support him (and him supporting me if necessary). He said if down the line, if he got better, and if I had the same feelings on the off chance, he would definitely accept. But he told me to not wait for him and recommended I look to other people to date.

This came as a huge shock, and I really don't know how to process my feelings. I think it would have been easier if he just said he viewed me as a friend, not someone he could have dated if he was better mentally. On the other hand, I care for him deeply as a friend, and want to support him too (within boundaries), and I respect his self-awareness. I'm hurt, but I'm also extremely concerned about this new information. I was crying (how selfish of me, but I was also crying at his pain) to a mutual close friend, who told me he has had suicidal thoughts in the past too.

My friend Anna started dating a new guy, Derek, that she met on tinder, and from the start I had my doubts. He was telling her that he was septated from his wife but not yet divorced because he was still working though the legal stuff. He wanted to keep stuff on the down-low because he said dating could hurt him in the divorce proceedings. He's also in touch with his ""soon to be ex"" wife a lot, supposedly just for co-parenting reasons.

I had my doubts, all that sounded just like something another married man conned me with when I was a lot younger. Saying he was separating when he wasn't. I was worried Anna was being lied to, but when I brought up my worries, she shut them down, saying she trusted him.

So I did some internet stalking, and found out his wife's name, and it turns out she's someone I was Facebook friends with because we used to go to the same fitness classes at the gym. Small town, I guess.

And I sent her a message saying ""I thought you should know Derek has been on tinder presenting himself as 'separated but not yet divorced'. If that's the situation, sorry to bother you. But if it's not, I thought you ought to know."" 

(I didn't mention Anna because I didn't want to throw her under the bus)

She replied saying that they were absolutely not separated, and asking for more evidence. I said unfortunately I hadn't been the one to match with him, I don't have any screenshots. She replied a day later saying she'd looked and found tinder on his phone.

I really meant to tell Anna what I'd done, but I hesitated, knowing she'd be heartbroken, she had really felt strongly about Derek. She texted me before I reached out, saying that Derek's ""soon to be ex"" wife had found out he was dating around and he'll probably be screwed over in the divorce. And he was blaming Anna for not keeping things quiet enough, and for telling her friends, one of whom had reached out to his wife.

I owned up to it, saying that I had messaged his wife, and heard a very different story from her. That they were married and not getting divorced. 

Anna is convinced she was lying or jealous or crazy but I'm not so sure. She's also mad at me for going behind her back, and she says that she needs some time not talking with me to cool down.

I'm giving her time, I haven't spoken to her since then. And right now, I'm stressed. I don't totally know what to believe about Derek's marriage, I don't know how to make things better with Anna. I'm giving her space and letting her be the first to reach out, but I'm worrying that she won't reach out, and I'll have ruined things with my friend. I don't know if I overstepped because the situation she's in is too ""close to home"" for me; when I was 17 I dated a married man in his 30s who claimed to be divorcing, and that was really screwed up and painful when the truth came out.

They've been helping me a lot and I appreciate everything that they have done. My parents have raised me with the notion that ""You can be anything you want to be so long as you work hard for it"". 

Over time, I began developing and realizing a few of my own preferences. Today, I'm an agnostic democratic homosexual. You can kind of tell where this is going.

Important Note:

When I came out of the closet, she told me that this lifestyle that I had ""chose"" was a sin. She also told me that if you love someone you tell them when they're being ignorant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, where my dad and I was watching the democratic debate. Naturally, he was smirking and mocking a few things that the candidates had said. He did this to try and prod a reaction from me as he knows all of these factors about me now.  

Following that, my mom entered the room, looked at the TV and called the candidates ""baby killers"".

I didn't know what she meant because I looked at Dad and asked him ""Did one of those candidates really murder a baby? That HAS to be fake news, because then they wouldn't even have a chance at running, right?""

""No, they wouldn't"", he replied.

""Then where does she get this information from?"", I said as we continued to watch the debate.

&#x200B;

Later, the topic of abortion came up. The candidates essentially summarized the topic by saying that it shouldn't be up to the government to dictate a women what she can or can not do with her body because the woman is a person...not a vessel. 

That's when it clicked. Mom wasn't talking about murder. She was talking about abortion.

Oh, but she had more to say. She couldn't' let it go.

&#x200B;

She got in my face and started spouting off to me what the bible says and I had to explain to her that not everyone is a Christian, people may live with different religious standards, and that there's separation of church and state for a reason.  


She  told me that abortion is murder, so I told her that if that were REALLY true then women who get abortions would be sentenced to first degree or second degree murder......which doesn't happen. (Even after the strict laws in Alabama were passed) I also said, ""If abortion is murder, then with that logic a miscarriage would be manslaughter, which isn't the case, is it?""  
I also told her that people who say its murder are only using that as a rhetorical device. then she told me that people don't KNOW right from wrong because they haven't read the bible.  
I told her ""99.99% people KNOW right from wrong, but they just don't care for the consequences. For example, the shooter that shot up the predominately black church KNEW what he did was wrong. That's why he didn't even want a trial. He just wanted the death sentence.""  
And then she told me some other personal not-so-nice things.....eventually I told her that I loved her but that she was brainwashed AND that she lives this ""Christian"" life while fighting for the rights of the rapist instead of the victim. She genuinely believes that it's the women's fault for wanting an abortion after the rapist commits those heinous acts.  
In conclusion, ever since I moved in here, my fuse has been a hell of a lot shorter. My temper is so bad now because i feel like I'm walking on eggshells.  I've been told in the past that if you love someone, you tell them that they're being stupid or ignorant. You don't keep letting them be ignorant. Additionally, I understand that there are certain things that you just have to ""let go"" but when I keep getting berated by statements that aren't even true, I eventually snap. I fear that our differences in politics and lifestyle preferences may result in a rough relationship with my parents and I'm not sure how to cope or what to do. 

&#x200B;

TLRD: Had a verbal altercation with my parents over politics and I'm afraid that it will continue in the future thus ruining our relationship.

535,TheFinalFrontEar,[new],17,c6mja5,33,"There was a mistake at my local pharmacy recently wherein after inputting my mother's new insurance information she was told that a medication she had been taking for years was no longer covered. She called the insurance and they confirmed that it was still covered, the pharmacy would just have to call them and everything would be sorted out. Well, a few days after my mother initially called the pharmacy to ask them to talk to her insurance and fix everything, she realized that they (the pharmacy) never called her insurance. So she was understandably starting the day off annoyed, and I decided to go with her to talk to a pharmacist in person.

&#x200B;

The only pharmacist we could talk to seemed very inexperienced and clearly didn't know what my mother was going on about. She said she would not call the insurance without her providing the correct insurance card (I'm still confused by this) but my mother was adamant that she only had the one card that she was showing her and a membership card. Again, I can understand that she was frustrated. My mother continued to get louder and angrier as she talked to the pharmacist, who I will give credit for keeping her cool and seemingly trying her best to be helpful. I tried to keep my mother calm by telling her to, well, calm down. Probably not the best move now that I think about it.

&#x200B;

We left still unsure how to proceed with the insurance issue. My mother has been pissed off the whole day, going on about how the pharmacist only wasn't helping her because she thought she was better than my mother. It really shouldn't matter that the pharmacist was Indian and we are Slavic, but for some reason my mother thinks it does. I told my mother that I have no idea what she's talking about, and she got even more mad saying that I have no experience in these things, that she could ""see it in her eyes"" that the pharmacist hated her for being Slavic, that apparently ""all Indians are like that.""

&#x200B;

I really think that my mother is overreacting with this and now she's angry at me for thinking that she's overreacting. I'm not trying to make her feel like I don't want to help her with this insurance problem, but she refuses to believe that unless I also say that I think the lady was being racist, which I don't think she was. How can I talk to my mother in a way that doesn't make her more upset?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My mother thinks that an unhelpful pharmacist, who happened to be Indian, was only being unhelpful because my mother is Slavic and apparently ""all Indians think they're superior to Slavs."" She is angry at me because I refuse to agree with her that the lady was being racist and not simply an inexperienced pharmacist.

So I have this friend of mine whom I know for almost a year now  (Lets call her Natalia) which I friend-zoned and we're completely platonic kind of relationship (More than once I mentioned her as ""like a sister that I didn't have""), during the last three months our hangout really increased, comparing to prior. And she's really a good and caring friend. She doesn't have a lot of boy-friends so I am basically the only male which she does hangout with alone. If I knew any better I would say that she has a little crush on me since she text me WAAAY more than I text her, also how she show some classic sings of interest during our hangouts. Not to mention how many times I heard from other friends of ours (group of boys & girls) when she go out with them how disappointed she is by the fact that I didn't make it to go out with the group.  In the last three times we have been out she brought her older sister (Probably at the same age as me -24) and I have found her sister really and truly attractive.

&#x200B;

The sister laugh at my joke, ask me genuine questions \_\_but\_\_ and not to blow up sunshine up to my ego lol, she references Natalia to me in a situations that not necessarily about Natalia. Eg. The sister is talking about a position we both applied for in a company she already work for, she says that we would work side by side if they got accepted.

&#x200B;

My gam is that I do value our friend-relationship to the point where I'm afraid of asking her sister out, and get this friendship situation all confused, not only by asking her sister and her out but with the whole side situation IF something came up as I am discovering my emotions towards the other gender and a lot of time don't feel that I would continue only during the first three months of dating. So I am approaching and gauging my overthinking lost, in a time where I need friends more than ever! This might be too interpersonal and philosophical to my own point of view but I really believe that human find a pattern in a lot of encounters, regardless of their culture. therefore any help and insight is much appreciated on what to do? Sometimes I think they're a lot of other girls out there that I could ask and not get my friend feelings (keeping in mind that those are just a believe of mine that she has them based on what previously stated) double hurt. I know she would have them even if her sister declined my offer.

538,FrustratedTed34,[new],11,c6m8gn,1,"I?m (34M) am not sure where I?m going wrong dating. My most recent experiences with Ex?s has only exacerbated my frustrations and find myself now in a place I don?t want to be, completely untrusting of women and their motives in dating. 

By all accounts I am a normal guy, I?m not fat or skinny (I have a gym membership, which gets some use), I am 5?10, I?m not Ryan Gosling(but not Frodo), I have many hobbies, interests and play sports. I have a fairly even temperament, not too many things unnerve me and I?ve been successful in my business. I live in a midsize city in the US. 

Here?s my dilemma. Recently, all of my ex?s, who have friend zoned me over the years now want to rekindle a relationship. During the breakups I accepted what they had to say, I didn?t fight, I didn?t argue, I accepted that they no longer wanted a relationship and moved on with my life. No matter how flimsy their reasoning, I took it at face value. Those that offered ?friendship? as consolation I took them up on their offer. I did no begging or pleading, I took my lumps and dealt with the hurt and pain alone and privately. 

Ex number 1, believed I was holding her back from seeing the world. I?m unsure how I was doing this, as I never said anything about her not seeing the world. I also, never said no, stop or stood in her way. Additionally, years later she still talks about wanting to see the world and hasn?t done so. 

Ex number 2, said we weren?t compatible, but I later found out she was secretly dating her physically abusive ex-boyfriend during the end of our relationship. I was hurt because I never had only been kind and good to her and she chose abuse over me. They eventually broke up when he went to jail for a few years. 

Ex number 3, was secretly striping she told me she was in sales, went as far as to get dressed in business attire to keep up the subterfuge. When she finally admitted what she had been doing, I accepted it and was understanding. She dumped me citing wanting to be single. She came to me months after the breakup, pregnant, asking for help. I bought her a crib and gave her a few hundred dollars for baby supplies. 

Ex number 4, which I was sure was finally the one, out of the blue dumped me. I later found out some minor league baseball player had pursued her. She wanted to pursue that relationship and dumped me. At the time she simply said she was unhappy, but could not articulate her reasons for said unhappiness. 

During all this, I haven?t changed much. I?m still the same height and weight. I pursue the same hobbies and interests (added a few new hobbies). I do own my own home, I make more money because I worked hard, but fundamentally I?m the same person.

So why now, after years of listening to ex?s cry over guys who they dumped me for, helping out after they made mistakes am I now the guy they want? Why am I now the bad guy for not wanting to date these women, after they literally broke me. I just wish they had wanted to stay friends, it feels like such a slap in the face. I feel my exes only want me back because my life has turned out alright and theirs have been a mess of their own making. 

Need help, I have a mix bag of emotionsthat I haven?t felt in years. I?m angry, confused, hurt, betrayed. I don?t want to implode years of friendship, but I also don?t want to feel used.

539,ImReallyBadAtThis98,Relationships,18,c6m5s8,3,"For some background information: My lifestyle involves mostly hooking up with people. I never go beyond oral with most, and I get myself tested for STD?s on a regular basis (full panel every 3-6 months, with regular Pap smears and Gyne check ups). I?ve only ever been with two men all the way.

Before I started sleeping with my friend now, I?d gotten myself tested to make sure I was clean. Everything was fine. When I asked him about his sexual history, he told me he always used condoms and gets himself tested every now and then too. He?s had way more partners than I have. Under the assumption that we were both clean, I was alright with engaging in unprotected sex with him since I?m on the pill. We started having sex three months ago.

About a month in, out of curiosity I asked him which clinic he usually goes to for testing because I was looking for a more affordable clinic that had a full panel. He couldn?t answer. When I asked him again, he said he?d never been tested before. I was furious at first, but decided to have him come with me to this new clinic I?d found that claimed they had the full panel but apparently only had testing for HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B. He came out clean for all three, which was a relief for me. I gave him a reminder that condoms weren?t always 100% effective, but apparently he already knew that.

There were instances where he made it seem like I was the only person he was sleeping with - a month in, he claimed that I was the only person he?d been with since we started. Around two weeks ago, I found a condom wrapper on his floor and he said that it must have been from around February since he doesn?t use them with me.

Today, I asked him straight up if he?d been with other people aside from me while we were sleeping with each other. He said yes, and said he always used condoms anyway. He knows full well that condoms aren?t effective against HPV, herpes, and syphilis.

This seemed incredibly irresponsible to me because it?s like he was putting me in danger. What should I do?

We still share memes just about daily, but I haven't talked to her in several weeks. I truly do believe that at one point there was something between us.

Our ""relationship"" is a complicated by a myriad of things, so I'm VERY hesitant about flirting. I feel that on my part I haven't really shown to her that I'm interested, neither of us have done much flirting. If it weren't for the other things she has done that I mentioned above, there wouldn't be much evidence of either of us having feelings for each other.

TLDR FROM ORIGINAL POST:
Close friend (Brad) at work asked me out on a date and I politely declined due to not wanting to date a colleague. I didn?t tell anyone, but was surprised to learn that a clique at work already knew and it was because he?d been going to one of the girls (Monica) for advice on the situation. They were really mean about him/the situation behind his back and I defended him. Now he has sent me an angry text message, presumably in relation to all this, accusing me of ?spreading shit about him? which I genuinely haven?t been and I am feeling really confused and upset. Not sure what?s going on or how to approach this.

THE UPDATE:
Following advice I received on here, I replied to Brad?s text. I said ?I am really confused and shocked by these accusations that you are referring to. Any of my friends will tell you that I have only ever had good things to say about you, and it really upsets me that you would just believe whatever Chinese whisper or story you have heard without discussing it with me first. I think it would be a good idea to discuss this situation in person please and talk through any misunderstandings which are currently occurring.?

Brad agreed to meet, and we did so for an hour the next day. He told me that Monica, Ashleigh and ?someone else? at work had told him that apparently I had said I ?wanted to avoid Brad where at all possible? and ?am scared to be alone with him?. I said to Brad I did not say either of these things, and think it is also pretty obvious there is no truth to the rumours from my actions in the way I am always initiating friendly chat with him, organised a birthday card and gift for him on behalf of everyone at work and also heavily encouraged him to come on a camping trip with some mutual work friends and me in a few months time. I did acknowledge that when Monica and Ashleigh interrogated me on my date rejection situation with Brad at the time, I said that I felt I needed a little bit of space with him (ie not to hang out one-on-one with him after work for a while until we can get over our feelings/awkwardness), but it is a massive and untrue exaggeration for them to twist this into me allegedly saying I was wanting to completely AVOID HIM and was ?scared to be left alone with him?. 

I told Brad I felt very upset at the way he had lashed out at me, and he apologised for it. He asked what I recalled from my conversation with Monica and Ashleigh and I said that?s actually what really hurt me - they had been saying really nasty things about him about the fact he?d asked me out and I was DEFENDING HIM. Yet here Brad now was lashing out at me and believing their twisted story that I was the one speaking ill of him. 

Brad was somewhat emotional and said he is having trouble trusting people - he seemed to be looking for reassurance from me that he could trust me which I thought I gave him, and then he said to me ?you know you can always trust me too?. The conversation was on the whole like a counselling session for him though - he didn?t ask me any questions about what I was feeling and didn?t seem to realise how much everything had been hurtful and difficult for me as well. 

On the whole though, I told him that this situation only involves him and me and as long as our friendship is good what does it matter what anyone else thinks or says? Monica and Ashleigh can mind their own damn business and moving forward, him and I need to put on a united front showing through our actions that everything is fine in order to diffuse the drama and rumours. He seemed to agree to this.

Today, however, it became painstakingly aware that Brad must?ve told Monica and Ashleigh about our conversation because they were particularly rude and snarky towards me all day, and Brad pretty much completely avoided me. I saw the 3 of them hanging out a lot and upon receiving some snarky messages from them on the work group chat (just general ones as opposed to directly related to these issues) another colleague who saw the messages came to see me and ask if I was okay and I burst into tears. I just don?t understand why Monica and Ashleigh have it out for me so much. I wish they?d stop interfering, stop always being so negative and snarky, and above all at least have enough maturity to act in a professional manner at work whereby they stop wildly exaggerating anything I say, stop slandering people behind their backs and can at least be polite to people even if they don?t like them very much. 

I?ve reached a point of despair now. I can?t stop crying, I can?t focus on doing my actual work, and I don?t feel like I can attend any work social events such as having lunch in the same space as them or anything like that. I?m extremely upset and just don?t know what to do from here. I?ve got a lot of other good friends at work and great relationships with all of management and my wider team etc, but at this point I almost feel I should just quit I feel so sick at the thought of having to see Monica, Ashleigh and Brad everyday.

Tl;dr: had conversation with Brad about his angry message. Thought it went reasonably well and we?d talked things through but became very clear today he had told Monica and Ashleigh about our situation and now the pair of them are being even more rude and snarky towards me than usual, while Brad is pretty much completely avoiding talking to me.

The only thing is that he sort of misrepresents a few of his relationships with some women in his life. There?s two women in particular he had flings and hooked up with prior to meeting me which really isn?t a big deal to me if they still keep in contact-however, these women still make their intentions very well known to him and chase him and he doesn?t seem to think much of it or let it bother him, and continues to speak with them. 

One of them is up the street and she?s in her 30?s and used her dying Grampa as an excuse to reach out and be consoled by him. She calls him excessively and texts him constantly and chases him hard and he just brushes it off and gives her the attention. He met up with her without me knowing and said they just talked. I called him out on it and explained it makes me uncomfortable and I?d just like to know if he?s hanging with her, in advice, and that seems to have subsided-he hasn?t reached out or vice versa and told me he doesn?t intend to.

One of them is from Denmark and she has been good friends through a mutual friend with my guy for years. The main thing that bothers me is she has a boyfriend and even cheated on him with my boyfriend about a year ago. She even asked him if they would be together if she were in the same country and he said they would be great together. She is constantly trying to video call him and stays up super late to speak with him. When we first started dating he was going on dates with me then video chatting her all night and calling her beautiful and kissing emojis and shit but that has stopped on his end once we got semi serious(without me interfering). I told him that I wouldn?t be the girl he?s dating because I?m geographically close to him, while he wishes he had some dream chick from Denmark. He said he wouldnt be interested in a relationship with her if she were here and that she needs to evaluate her own life and relationship. However, she continues to seek out his attention and he continues to give it ?I?m only a Facebook message away and I?m always here for you? ect. I spent the past week taking care of his sick dog, while I worked from home, and he still messaged her back and immediately(he?s never prompt about replying to anyone) when she said ?I really miss you, I want to start talking to you again.

Either way, she told me she wasn't going to do the same and instead explore other options before coming back and seeing if we're really what we need and want for each other after she fixes herself. She explained that was the whole point of a break, to get away from each other to see if we're really what we need. I agree with that statement as well but I don't know how to feel with the whole exploring other options being a necessary part in this and I don't know what to do about it either. Then last night, she messages me saying sorry again for all of this, explaining that she's been feeling like shit and crying throughout the whole day as it was one of the hardest things for her to do. She reassured me saying she really does love me, and because she loves me she decided on this break to figure all that stuff out. I answered her in the same sort of fashion, stating that I haven't been feeling all too well either and just crying my eyes out throughout this whole day while thinking about her all day as well. But I've been trying to stop as I know how important this is to her and I don't want to worry her anymore. I told her how much I love her, a love I can't even describe, and stated I missed her as much as well. But I understand how important this break is for figuring herself out, so I told her I'll be strong and support her through this and hope that she can be strong as well, giving her goodnight and promising her she'll get through this. Today I got in touch with her again, saying I hope I don't disturb you in any way but that I just really wanted to text and keep in touch as I've just been non stop thinking of her. Even if it's a simple good morning or goodnight like we used to do, that's all I really asked for as it just helps me get through this which may not really be true. I told her good morning and all and said I hoped she had a better night sleep than I did at the end. With all that, she didn't really acknowledge the above, only stating how she hasn't been able to sleep either and was only able to when she started talking to a friend of mine named Grant, ranting off to him and all. That really bugged me, as she described that they've been talking more and more.

&#x200B;

 I told her that was nice and decided not to say anything else after and just let her do what she believes is best, but I can't stop thinking about her and her decision of looking for other people. She seems to already found a person she's interested and I just can't have it stop bugging me. I've lost sleep cause of everything and have cried throughout the whole day and night, being in a shaky and terrible state ever since. I just don't know what to do, I've tried to talk to my friends and distract myself but I end up either crying more or just looking back at texts and photos with each other as I wait for her to send a message or anything in general. I don't why I do this, but I don't know what else to do. I know it's doing more harm than good but I just can't get my mind off of it and I can't stop being sulky and lazy. I don't feel like getting up, eating, or just doing anything and I got to force myself to do almost everything. I'm pretty I just fell into depression, but I've never had it this bad before and it just hurts. Everything hurts, even when I breathe in I'm met with a sharp pain that seems to last forever. I just don't know what to do and I don't really know how to handle this, and I don't have many friends that'll be there for me constantly whenever I get like this. I just need help on what to do and whether or not we're going to get back together or not, and if I need to find help in this or if anyone can just talk to me whenever needed which might be asking for too much. Either way, I appreciate all the help offered in this thread as such things will get me through this.

**TL;DR** Gf and I are on a break since yesterday, where shes open to finding other people to talk to while I decided not to do the same. She stated this break was for her well being and could last months, and I went with it in support of her even though I'm hurting pretty bad from it. Found out she might be talking to someone new already and made me feel even worse than before. I can't stop thinking about her and looking back through text messages and photos, which doesn't help my case of falling into an extreme state of depression of doing nothing and forcing myself to eat, sleep and move.

So boyfriend \[27M\] and I \[24F\] have been dating just over 3 year. It's good for the most part however we rarely have sex and I don't feel like he finds me attractive (weight gain, aging etc). The former is of course making me feel even less attractive. This is quite different to all my other relationships and I would really appreciate some insight.

&#x200B;

However, I get hit on a lot, especially when I'm by myself. The issue is that I've begun to enjoy it as it makes me feel more attractive, but that of course makes me feel very guilty because what should anyone else's opinions matter? Unfortunately my boyfriend  does nothing, honestly nothing, to make me feel good about myself and while I know that insecurity is MY shortcoming, I feel like he should do more to make me feel like I am valued as a girlfriend because I have  made clear my feelings many times. Also, I did try telling him just how often I have these encounters with people, which he did not seem to believe (making me feel, as usual, unattractive). However, now I get an extra thrill out of these because it proves what seem to be his feelings on this happening wrong.

&#x200B;

To be clear, I love my boyfriend a lot and he has really helped me through some difficult times. He is the kind of person you couldn't hate, very kind and likable. I have absolutely no intention of cheating on him however I am terrified that say, by another two years, I am just so fed up of not feeling appreciated that I feel like giving these random dudes time for a hangout or a coffee will be the only way I can feel good about myself physically, which will likely result in a pretty awkward or potentially dangerous scenario.

&#x200B;

I guess my questions for reddit are; is it normal to have thoughts like these? is it normal to just, not really be interested in your girlfriend physically (I'm relatively good looking but maybe not his thing)? is there any way I can talk to my boyfriend about these feelings and not look like a jackass?

I?ve never done this before so I?ll try to keep this as short as possible but here it goes.

I (25F) have been dealing with this girl (23F) on and off for about 2.5 years. We?ve never been in a real relationship, it?s more like we have an on an off fuck buddy situation but we have established that we liked each other and I guess that?s where things got complicated. Last summer we were on again and, even after a whole bunch of stuff on her part, we never really stopped. Now that she?s out of uni she?s been going through a post grad depression and it?s been effecting our ?relationship.?

Since the summer started she?s picked arguments with me, and pretty much been inconsiderate on my end. Like she?ll show up to places super later without letting me know, pretty much will cancel on me for whatever her friends want to do, and just overall doesn?t seem to pay too much attention to me physically, or emotionally. We even got to the point to where we agreed to stop having sex so that we can ?work on our relationship.? I have no problem with not having sex because I do have feelings for her and value you her as a person and a friend. 

But here?s the thing. Ever since this agreement she?s been in the worst type of moods. I will invite her over and she?ll have the worst attitude and barely even say any words to me. Half the time we don?t even share the same bed at this point. I?ve already experience my post grad phase so I completely understand what she?s going through and I?ve been trying to talk to her about it, I try to shower her with gifts and nice gestures. I?ve even fixed up her resume and started applying to jobs on her behalf. I don?t want her to feel down and I understand that she?s dealing with some mental health issues but I feel like... she?s not really helping herself at this point. 

I?ve brought up all of these issues to her as they come along and they always end up in an argument. But she does apologize and recognize where she was wrong and promises to work on but then she just gets.. down about herself. I?ve seen a lot of posts on here and I definitely don?t think she?s manipulative or trying to turn the tables on me. I genuinely thinks she feels bad about making me upset, but it seems to make her overall behavior even worse because she gets frustrated with herself. 

I use to love having her around but now it feels like she?s always in a bad mood. I know the easy answer is to just stop inviting her over but would I be wrong if I told her not to bring all of her negative energy into my space? Like, I live alone and I don?t mind it at all. I?d almost rather spend nights alone than to have someone in my house who barely even acknowledges me at times. Plus that?s one less person to cook for and feed. 

I want to be there for her because I do love her but at what point do I start protecting myself? Am I thinking too much into this? Should I just wait it out and hope things get better? Or would I be wrong for telling her not to come around unless she was in a good/better mood?

My story:

I met her through some friends at an event last autumn. She lives 2 hours away from my place but I just had to talk to her again because it felt like nothing I have ever experienced before, to be around her. A week and some sleepless nights later I managed to jump over my own shadow for the first time ever and contacted her. Half a year later we talk everyday about everything. I finally asked her out but f\*\*\*ed up because I was too nervous. We got over it and met each other since then. During all that she had a really hard time in her life and it felt like she is on the edge of getting a burnout. Now things turned out good for her and she is the friendly, sympathetic and beautiful person I always saw in her. It feels like it is finally the right time to tell her what I feel for her.

554,MrTsfree,Relationships,14,c6lb6w,2,"TLDR; I feel like I am a datable person, but no one else agrees.  What do I change?

A little background about myself.  I am a rising Junior at my college.  I am outgoing as you can often find me participating in many clubs when I?m not working on actual schoolwork, and at parties on the weekend.  I love meeting new people and click with 99% of the people I meet to where we have a good relationship, professional, or personal.  I?ve happen to become the type of person that you come to ask for relationship advice that is never in a relationship.  

About 2 years ago, I went through a nasty breakup with a high school love interest.  To sum up that relationship, I fell deep in love with a girl that used me to get back at her ex, just for her to get back together with him and leave me in pieces.  I was a shell of a person for months after that.  But it taught me an important lesson in both self worth and self confidence.  Since then, I?ve completely changed how I am as a person. 

The breakup happened just about a month before my high school graduation.  In high school, I was very shy, and wasn?t comfortable meeting new people, so I stuck to a small friend group which quickly fell apart after the breakup.  I basically wanted to get through the day just to get back to the comfort and familiarity of my room.  Moving past the high school me, I decided moving up to college was a good way for me to restart.  

I became much more outgoing, meeting new people left and right.  I joined multiple clubs anywhere from being a member of a club focused around my major, being a school tour guide, to being voted in as vice president of my college choir.  I even joined a fraternity which I was so not expecting myself to do.  At this point in my college career, being a part of all of these groups and organizations has been not only a great way to meet new people, but also a great way to try to find a romantic relationship.  

My school is about a 60%, 40%, split for girls and guys, with the girls being the 60%.  So many of these groups have given me many female friends, which I would have interest in dating.  I have a few very close female friends who claim that it would be dumb for a girl to reject me, as they say that any girl would be lucky to have me.  I try my best to not be a gloating type when it comes to females, and I?m not one to try to just look for a girl to make out with at a party.  I want something that will last for more than a few hours.  I want a lasting relationship that has some actual meaning behind it.  A lot of my want for a relationship like this may stem from the fact that many of my close friends are actually in great relationships, and I may be subconsciously jealous, I?m not sure.  

I feel that the change from my high school me to my college me has made me more available to the dating scene, but I?ve tried to make friends with females I?m interested in and I can?t even get a reply back.  Maybe I?m coming on too strong, maybe too weak, either way I can?t tell.  This situation of more a less a ?silent shutdown? has happened on multiple occasions at this point.

One of his placement mentors is an older lady, around 30,  divorced with a kid, but is one of those ""cool young mom"" types. He  never really talked about her but I recently found out shes been giving  him rides home after work. I also noticed him chatting with her on whats  app a lot lately and have also seen notifications on snap chat from her  on his phone. He never really hides his phone from me and always has it  sitting screen up so its not hard to notice these things. I told him I  was getting a little jealous of his new work ""friend"" and he essentially told me he loved me and I was being crazy and need to trust him... but I  feel like if the roles were reversed he would see it all as crossing a  bit of a line. He told me shes in a relationship and she knows hes in a  relationship, but it all just doesn't sit right with me, and whenever I  bring it up I always end up apologizing at the end because I don't want  to be seen as the crazy girlfriend whose being overly controlling or  something...

He's also started making comments to me about saying how I would ""look good with a tattoo here"" because she has one and he thinks its cool...

I'm going to try to keep this as neutral as possible but I apologise if I get emotional. TL;DR at the bottom.

# Some background I feel may be important:

I originally met D about 2 years ago (I was 19 and he was 21) through a mutual friend who neither of us speak  to anymore (unrelated) and we quickly bonded and became friends. I had just gotten out of a relationship \~6 months prior and wasn't ready to have a bf again and he had been single and hadn't even slept with anyone in 2 years by that point. We share a lot of interests and I became close with his family after a few months. D was living with them while recovering from a near death motorcycle accident.

&#x200B;

 Because my living situation at the time was such a disaster D's parents offered me to stay with them for a while since I was helping him fix his bike after the accident (his main mode of transportation) and helping him with rides to work in the meantime and stuff. In return he worked on my car for free (oil changes, maintenance, etc.) He's a mechanic and I'm a full time college student who works a lot of desk jobs. We hung out pretty much every day and developed a mutually beneficial and satisfying friendship. He is one of the few people in my life that I have felt truly connects with and understands me.

&#x200B;

After a few more months D and I  started to develop feelings for each other which he eventually revealed to me one night. I told him I liked him too and after a couple weeks of doing the will-we-or-won't-we dance, hooking up a couple times (we did not have sex yet) he decided that even though he really liked me, he wanted to make sure he had his ducks in a row before getting into a relationship with anybody. He wanted to get a car, pay off some debts, move out of his family's house, etc. He didn't feel like he could be a good boyfriend to me if he didn't have responsibilities in order. We had planned to move in together before any of this happened and since I wasn't super attached to him romantically yet, I was cool with just being friends. He promised me he wasn't going anywhere and would come get me when he was ready, he didn't want to date anyone else, and that I could feel free to do my own thing.

&#x200B;

About 6 months passed and we continued to see each other every day since I was living with him still, and things were fine for a while. I dated another guy for like 2 months and it ended up not working out because we wanted different things in relationships and we parted amicably. D did not get another girlfriend, as he promised, and again didn't have sex with anyone (he hooked up with a friend of his a couple times who he used to kind of date but they didn't have sex and there wasn't anything even remotely serious going on; she's also no longer friends with him for unrelated reasons). 

&#x200B;

There was a couple months after I broke up with the other guy where there was so much tension between D and I it could have been cut with a knife. He finally told me he didn't care about all of the other stuff, he wanted to be with me and he had made enough progress to feel comfortable that he would be able to check off the things on his list even while being with me. We had sex and became exclusive soon after. It was an explosive passionate relationship, we love each other very much, the chemistry was there, and he had been my best friend for so long that we really got along great. We planned to get our own apartment soon and then D could save up for a car and pay off his debts.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, in a series of evens beyond my control, I lost my job. D had to support me financially during this time, and his parents began preparing to move like they had planned. We were supposed to be out of there by that point, but because I had no job, and we had nowhere else to go, we had to go to my dad's house. My dad is crazy and abusive but we were able to deal with his antics together, as a team. We were always a really good team.

&#x200B;

We eventually got our own place, adopted a dog, etc. and were happy for a few months. It was only a 6 month lease so we could test the waters, and my mom needed me to come help her over the summer with my younger brothers anyway so at the end of the lease D was going to move in with some roommates whose leases were ending around the same time as ours (mutual friends) where he would pay cheaper rent and be able to save up some money while I went to stay with her for the summer, and we'd reevaluate the situation at the end of the summer.

&#x200B;

 Eventually the stress of bills, putting food on the table, etc. got to us. We always got shit done and pulled through, but it was hard and caused a lot of strain to our relationship. We had been forced into difficult circumstances so young and it was taking a toll. We had several bad fights, and argued a lot for a few months, almost breaking up a couple times. During this time we came to a few agreements, both of us agreed to work on certain things, and we seemed to be moving forward. It felt to me like just a rough patch we would get through.

&#x200B;

The lease ended at the beginning of June and things seemed to be getting better for a bit before we got into a big fight. I felt like D wasn't doing the things I asked him to do even though I had been doing my best to hold up my end of the agreements. We had difficulty communicating, we yelled a lot at each other, and I told him to leave me alone for a while and come back when he had a plan to work on stuff. He didn't speak to me for a week and I finally went to check on him Sunday to see if he was okay because I had never gone that long without him speaking to me. D normally misses me after a day of me being gone. We were both always independent and didn't need to talk all day, and we'd leave each other alone while taking care of work/school stuff, but we'd speak at least once a day. When I went to talk to him, he broke up with me. 

&#x200B;

D said the stress and pressure from the past few months was too much for him and he needed some space from me. He hadn't accomplished as much as he wanted and felt he had rushed at the beginning before he was really ready because he loved me so much. He had things he felt he needed to do on his own, pay down his debts, get a car, a more secure savings, etc. I told him I didn't feel right about it, because I saw us finally getting a chance to live independently and work on our own stuff as a good thing; we wouldn't have the added stress of work and bills and we could work on our relationship kinda starting fresh in a more normal setting (I realise the way we did things was kind of backwards, life comes at you fast is all I can say). He said he'd consider what I had said and we could meet again to collect our thoughts and feelings. We both cried and kissed and told each other we love each other and he reminded me he's always be there for me no matter what if shit hits the fan and I can still count on him like I always have.

&#x200B;

We met back up last night and he told me he still wanted to break up. Because I strongly felt it would be a bad idea (I thought it would cause both of us more harm than good at the end of the day because we still love each other and would just be torturing ourselves when we have the opportunity to just start a new chapter and work on things in a controlled environment). He understood how I was feeling and he told me we could have a middle ground; because he still loves me very much and wants to be the kind of man I deserve if we end up getting back together in the future, he'd like the time and space away from me for a few months to do what he needs to do and we could meet again in \~6 months or so and have a conversation about potentially trying again. He didn't want to advertise that we were breaking up or date anyone else, and I believe him because he kept his word last time, and came to get me when he felt ready. i asked him to promise me that if we do get back together that this time there would be no in and out and he would 100% be ready to work on things and be in it for the long haul, without anymore of this breaking up and getting back together stuff. He agreed. We kissed, told each other we love each other, he reminded me again to call him if I ever need anything, and we parted ways.

&#x200B;

My question now is how to go about dealing with all of this in a way that ensures I won't get hurt. I truly have no desire to be with anyone else and I've had a few longer term relationships by this point so I know what I really want in a man. He has a lot of qualities that are important to me that are difficult to find (into riding bikes together, adventurous, child-free, down to live in a log house in the middle of the woods and ride dirt bikes together forever, progressive but still a southern gentlemen, a family I'd be down to marry into, etc.). I truly feel like this could potentially be my soulmate. 

&#x200B;

I'm a very logical person, I make a lot of lists (pros and cons), and I really think and research things through without being emotional, and even the part of my brain that I've emotioanlly separate form the situation thinks this. He's told me before that he can see himself with me long term but because we're so young and things in our lives are still so volatile, he wants to make sure he never fucks things up with me so that he loses me forever. He's also told me that if he ever completely lost me like that, it would kill him inside. He's looked me dead in the face, point blank serious and has told me he would take a bullet for me, he would DIE for me if he ever needed to. He's the kind of person who means what he says, and I really do think he loves me; he never says things like that lightly. I don't think this is an excuse to get rid of me because he doesn't like me or something. If it were, he would tell me. He's always been honest even if the truth sometimes isn't what I want to hear. I know this person so closely and intimately, I'm sure that everything he has said is the truth.

&#x200B;

I truly think he believes he's protecting both of us with this decision, but I'm obviously still really bummed about it. I feel the loss very hard and it sucks that my best friend, my other half, my partner in crime who has been there with me through so much the past couple years, so suddenly just disappeared from my life. Need help navigating the next 6 months and would love any help I can get. I've told one friends with him (who has known him for 4-5 years) and he thinks this is a good plan and that things will work themselves out. My friends have also said this is a good compromise. Before anyone says anything, I am open to the possibility that I will meet someone new in this time, and if I do, then great. However, I am so picky and I very rarely meet people I feel comfortable being with long term. (I started dating pretty young, about 15 which is the only reason I've managed to have several serious-ish relationships so far. in the past 6 years I've met maybe 4 such guys). I have my own stuff to focus on so I know I'll be alright, just wanna know the best way to  handle things for now. Thanks!

Alright, get ready sit down this is a long one. So I broke up with my [23F] ex bf [23M] of a relationship of 4.5 years, because he became dismissive and made unilateral decisions about his future. We just inherently get each other, so talking/ sense of humor has always been easy. I told him at the end of June I'd talk to him again, but before that time it was obvious he needed to move on. So I let him. As a note we were in long distance for a year because of this choice.

So, shortly after the breakup a coworker friend [30M] worked his damned well hardest to knock the pants off me. He was always there for me cares about my needs and is able to meet my emotional needs more than anyone has before. Only caveat is that we would be doing distance on a greater scale until I am able to move. Go to today we are dating things are good he is still incredibly sweet and caring, but we don't have that same sense of getting each other and I am not sure if that is just something that comes with time..or if relationships are just different person to person...I am scared that what I need to do in life is not what he has in mind for his, just like my same issue with my ex, but this might just me feeling scared as my feelings grow for this new person due to my abandonment issues.

The landlord is usually out of the city for work in another part of the country, so I don't see him much. My roommate and I used to have small conversations here and there, but ever since he lost his job we've practically stopped talking to each other like normal people. It's gotten to the point that he doesn't acknowledge that I say ""Hi"" to him. I don't know what he's doing nowadays and I figured that because he lost his job he's probably under a lot of stress, so better not poke the bear, right? Recently, he's started getting fed up with how dirty the kitchen is and leaving passive aggressive messages on the kitchen counter. Some things were reasonable like cleaning out the sink drain with food in it, which I finally got around the habit of doing it. But then, he starts ranting about how 'dirty' the kitchen stovetop was, which is routinely cleaned on a weekly basis during the weekend as agreed at the beginning when we first moved in. I say dirty in quotes because to be frank it's not as dirty as he says it is (little spits of food or sauce here and there). Sadly, there wasn't any agreement signed, so everything was verbally agreed upon. I recognize my other roommate is a student and he's been held up with exams lately and working weekends, so he doesn't get the cleaning done until probably Monday. So I sometimes cover his shifts for him, so he doesn't worry about it and focuses on his studies. For me, I don't mind cleaning on a weekly basis and try my best to clean it. I'll even clean areas my roommates don't think about like the microwave, under the fridges, under the stovetop lid, etc. I replied back in writing on his note reminding him of the weekly cleaning schedule we had and encouraged him to speak with the landlord or myself if he had concerns. Instead, he went on a fit of how unacceptable it was that he's cleaning up my mess (when the mess is really shared if you think about it. Do I need to pull out my microscope now to figure out who made the mess?) and won't clean up the kitchen anymore. 

Honestly, I feel the fact he's writing notes to me instead of talking to me and acknowledging my existence is pretty childish. This guy is in his 30s and probably has more social skills than I do as he goes out a lot, so he should be the adult expert. 

Am I being the unreasonable one here? Should I just go to my landlord at this point and let him know the situation?

561,TernaryRain,[new],9,c6koof,1,"Hi everyone, throw away for obvious reasons. So this girl I met through a family friend (her uncle whom I've known for about 2 decades) had started dating a month ago. Things were going well, for the most part we like each other a lot and seemed to enjoy going out together and have a lot of the same interests. We had been intimate but not to the extent that was what we wanted at the time (not on BC and no condoms, didn't think it was going to move so quickly...). We already have about an hour's drive difference between us and she just accepted a job offer making it about 2-3 hours distant. We normally would text or facetime when we wouldn't be on a date together so the distance was not too unbearable, but I have done LDR in the past and it can work, but seeing as this is so new its hard. Two days ago we had a conversation over facetime about it and she said she thinks it might be a good idea to stop pursuing a relationship because of the relocation and the fact that its still new and that she will be focused on being a new doctor. I will be returning to school to finish my Bacherlor's in the Fall so I get it, we'll both be occupied with our own lives and the extra distance on top of that hinders a relationship. Anyway 2 weeks ago she invited me to her grad party this coming Sunday before she got the job offer and before we had our talk. When she invited me she had said she wanted to invite me, but thought asking would be too soon, but I of course said yes because I truly like this person a lot. Anyway I have mixed feelings about the situation. I know I have to talk to her about it before Sunday, however I've gone from being introduced to her friends and family that I haven't met as 'the guy I'm dating' to 'guy I was dating and we stopped to be professionals, let's make it weird.' At the same time I want to be there for her to celebrate her achievement  and I already had said I would go. In my past relationships I've always rushed into things and had been mostly compliant in doing whatever my partner would want, but with this woman I've felt like it was more mature and we actually expressed what we wanted out of a relationship and the importance of communication. The situation as a whole kinda sucks because I'm torn as to what do. I don't plan to wait for her like a grieving widow mourning their lost spouse forever, but I feel like not going kinda extinguishes any chance of something maybe in the future (sounds super creepy and really weak, but that's how I feel) and in all honesty I wanted to be friends with her as a starting point  because I had never done that before in previous relationships. All I know is that I need and will talk to her about it before hand, but I would like some input from others about it.

562,kannala457,[new],0,c6kok5,0,"Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this short.

About five weeks ago my ex boyfriend (M22) ended our relationship of two and a half years
 He has given several reasons for doing this, but I think overall it's been chalked up to that he simply wasn't happy with me. Needless to say, even though a lot of people in my life thought he was a jerk and not right for me, I was (and still am) hurting tremendously.

As this relationship came to an end a former coworker who still frequents the restaurant I work at reached out to me and was incredibly kind. He let me stay at his place after the breakup to have distance from my ex while he moved out of the apartment we shared. When I decided I wasn't going to stay in my old apartment, he quickly arranged for me to meet his parents who owned rental property so I could find and move into a new place. We started talking daily, going on dates once or twice a week, and sleeping together. About a week and a half ago I asked to be exclusive, and he agreed.

Until this week, I had very minimal contact with my ex. We ended up talking on the phone Monday night and I ended up basically bawling on the phone with him, saying I still had no idea why we ended and how much that hurt me. Since then I've been pretty mopey, just going to work then going home to sleep and cry.

I feel stupid for asking to be exclusive so soon. My current partner is great in a lot of ways, but when I think about seeing him or having sex again I feel uneasy. It feels not fair that he wants to be with me but I spend so much more of my time thinking about my ex than I do him.

But needless to say, a breakup would be messy given some of the circumstances. His parents are now my landlords. He and his family and friends are the people I talk to and spend time with more than anyone (not sure if this is relevant, but I live quite far from my own family).

Sorry if this is messy, I think I just need some advice navigating my feelings about this, and input on what to (or not to) do next.

My parents are early 40s years old. I also have an older brother (20m) who's a student in university and I'm close with my cousin (17f) who lives near our house.

Last week I did my coming-out to my parents, I told them I'm bisexual. My dad didn't completely accept that I'm saying the truth but he asked me questions and reacted more calm than my mom. She was crying for 30 minutes and said I'm trying to give her a heart attack and some other ugly stuff. She told me I have to go to a psychologist because I'm too young to think like this.

So anyway. I want to convince my parents to send me to actual psychotherapy. We live in a city and there's those doctors for kids in health centers and hospitals, I know because one of my friends went when she had anorexia. I also think I have depression or anxiety and I want to go.

I already know my mom will want me to go to some Church counselor, she always wants alternative medicine. I really don't want to go there. Her aunt is a nun and she'll probably give my mom bad advice where to ask for help.

Please help me convince her about this so she doesn't just say ""you're a kid, I know the best, you're going to go Church anyway"". And dad will just agree with whatever mom decides because he doesn't want to fight.

564,JazzySpice,Relationships,197,c6k1jv,243,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 3 years. We got together my freshman year of college and he was in his sophomore year. Things have gotten serious and we will be graduating quite soon. He has 2 semesters left and I have 3 semester left. We also live together. We have plans of getting married after college, but now I?m not so sure that I want to marry him or keep dating him. I will tell you why. 

So, here are some of the problems: 

1. He is usually nice, but gets very angry when I disagree with him and don?t do things his way. He flies into a rage sometimes and starts yelling at me and cursing. I have told him many times that I don?t like yelling and he said he would stop, but he hasn?t. He used to bang on the desk really hard or smash somethings but he hasn?t done that in a while. I remember he told me ?I like things done my way without any question?. One example of this rage was when he told me to warm up his food. I was going to, but then I got a call from my friend who was coming to get an art tool. She said she was at my place, so I put his food down and went to quickly give her the art tool. I come back into the room and I notice that his phone has been smashed and his food is turned over. He told me he got furious that I didn?t warm up his food first, so he threw his phone so hard against my wall that it smashed and he turned his food over in the process. I wasn?t even gone 5 minutes. 

2. I do not want to live in my hometown forever and I have plans to move when I graduate. I want to go to japan, maybe stay there a bit. I am sick of my hometown. I?ve been here all of my life and I can?t do it anymore. One of my biggest fears is staying here for the rest of my life. He wants to stay here forever and does not have any plans to leave. He doesn?t even want to move to another part of the state. 

3. He has an obligation to his mom and family. He has to take care of his mom who does not know much English. He has an older sister and younger sister, but as far as I know a lot of things fall on him. He also plans to buy his mom a house after college. His mom relies on him for almost everything so I can understand why he doesn?t have any plans to ever move away. I don?t have those same obligations. My family wants me to move away and explore the world. They support me on whatever I do. 

4. He does not have a car or license. I don?t either right now, but I am actually getting my car at the end of the summer and I am getting my license. He said that he won?t get his license until I get my license and he?s going to drive my car when I get it. 

5. He is quite traditional and expects me to cook, clean, and be submissive. Even when I am tired he still expects me to cook while he plays computer games/watches YouTube. I don?t too much mind, but I would like a break every now and then. One time he told me I had changed once I had gotten my new job. He said that I wasn?t submissive and that I talked back more. He said he missed the old me who was quiet and more submissive. I did not like that, but I didn?t do anything about it. 

6. He pressures me into sex and tbh when we met, I was not ready to do it and wanted to keep my virginity, but he wore me down. He said he needed it and that he wanted to be the person to take my virginity. Later in the relationship he admitted to me that he felt he pressured me, but he didn?t apologize he just shrugged his shoulders. There were sometimes during sex when I told him I was uncomfortable but he told me to just let him finish. Or when I?m not in the mood he will still try to pull my underwear down and if I don?t comply then he gets mad and gives me silent treatment. 

7. He expects me to spend time with him and his sisters. His mom doesn?t know about me yet and his dad is deceased. His sisters are the only ones who know about me. The problem is that when I ask him to spend time with my family, he is always busy and can?t do it. 

8. He doesn?t like cuddling with me. This one kind of hurts. When I ask to cuddle he usually ends up pulling my underwear down or trying something sexual, but I just want to lay there with him and be held. When I tell him that he sighs and says ?okay fine...? and he will lay with me for about 3 minutes and then he will say ?okay cuddle time is over? and he will go back to playing his game. 

9. He also does not comfort me when I am crying or upset. He just stands there and stares. No hug, no nothing. 

10. One time he said I ?looked like a hoe? in front of my co-workers because of a shirt I had on. One of my co-workers was like ?wow.... no..I was going to say she looked like a cool gothic vampire...?.    I will admit that my shirt was not appropriate but I had it covered up with a jacket. I was upset that my boyfriend said such a thing in front of my co-workers, but he thought that he was right and did not feel bad. He has a habit or sort of throwing jabs at me in front of people. 

So those are some of the main issues in the relationship. I am sorry for any typos. Is it time to end things? Am I being unreasonable or thinking too much into things?

A couple of weeks ago, I found out that she cheated on me last year, giving a work colleague of hers oral during a really difficult point in our relationship. We've talked about this, like adults, and we have both admitted to being at fault during this particular tough time however, her actions have literally torn me apart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Friends and family know all about my not being honest with money. No one knows what she has done. We share friends and are very close with family. People are questioning and blaming me. No one knows to question her. There is no one to be angry at her, no one to be disappointed with her - no one who to make her feel as shit as I think she needs to feel.

The mental images of the one you love the most with another man? The thoughts of what else might have gone on? 

Do you even ask for the full details - is there any clarity to be gained from knowing everything?

Did you get to a point where you just couldn't handle the thoughts any more and decided to start fresh?

She's always been quite open and honest with me but this time I felt like she was hiding something.  And here's where I screwed up. Even though I could've simply asked her, I opened her Instagram because she'd told me her password and read her chat with the guy. I closed it immediately and told her about what I'd done. She apologized about hiding what she was hiding and explained it to me. I apologized about the breach of privacy. I know I broke her trust and she's hurt.

I fucked up. Quite terribly so. . My question is.. Can I earn her trust back? Will we be normal? Or have I ruined my dream relationship with the girl I love more than anything? I know I'll never do it again and will keep my stupid impulses to myself. She changed her password obviously and feels like I can't be trusted with it for now. Which is fair. What should I do?

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. Last night may have been the final straw.

I'm not sure if he's technically an alcoholic but he definitely has a problem controlling his drinking whenever he does drink. Last night he went to hang out with some friends from work at their apartment and called me while I was at work (I work nights) to come pick him up because he was too drunk to drive. He knew I had to work last night before he left but was too intoxicated to remember I guess. He then calls me three more times to ask if I can pick him up and each time I tell him ""no"" and make it clear that he needs to call an Uber. He calls me again and tells me that he's walking home. The area he was in was at least 12 mi away from our apartment and has some dangerous roads that are not well lit. I try to tell him again to call an Uber and he says that someone is driving him but for some reason he can't/won't say who is driving him. Then, he calls and says he's at an area close to his mom's house which is about halfway between our apartment and the location he was at previously. He tells me he will walk from there and I again tell him to just call an Uber. He finally says that yes, he will call an Uber and I tell him to make sure he calls me when he gets home. He never calls me. I called him four times while I was at work and he never picked up. Then, as I'm on my way home, he calls me and asks why he has four missed calls from me. At this point I just tell him that I would call him later and that I'm very disappointed. He says that he ""doesn't want to fight right now because he's on his way to work"". I say ""ok"" and hang up.

Now, I know this incident doesn't seem like the *worst* thing in the world. BUT, (and people who know someone struggling with any type of addiction will understand this) this is nowhere near the first time something like this or much worse has happened. I'm still mad about the time he got drunk and somehow managed to ruin 75% of the clothes in my closet by getting blood on them. And the time he threw up on my shoes... and the time he drove home deunk....Oh and the time he burned himself and layed hands on his sister.... I could go on. I'm just so tired of having the same arguments, him apologizing and promising not to do it again....and then doing it again. 

Familiar points I bring up when we have the same conversation over and over again:

-you're too old for this

-you could hurt someone or hurt yourself

-if you truly cared about me, you would stop doing this or at least try (am I wrong for saying this bcuz he has an addiction?)

-you could lose your job

-whenever you get too drunk you break stuff, damaged stuff, or lose stuff (he's broken two chairs, a vase, etc, and lost his wallet countless times)

-it's a waste of money when you have to call someone to get you or we have to spend money to replace things that you've broken

I do love him and I want the best for him but I can only fight so much for someone else without them trying to make improvements for themself. At this point I don't see this problem getting any better because it has existed throughout our relationship. Although, I have to admit, at first I didn't see it. I think this is because when we started dating I was new to drinking and also new to him, I just wasn't sure what the norm was. Looking back now, there were signs I should have seen even in the first few months of our relationship but did not. Hindsight = 20/20 amiright

I have contemplated ending our relationship over this in the past and now that idea seems close, if not inevitable. I understand he has a problem and I understand how hard addiction can be to overcome / live with which adds weight to my decision. He probably feels really bad about his problem too, especially judging by the way he apologizes to me. But it doesn't seem like he's done anything to fix it. what I'm getting at is, I'm not really scared of what would happen to me if I decide to end this relationship but I think he would be terrified. He doesn't know how to express his emotions so I'm making the assumption that his terror comes out as anger whenever I bring this up.

And another thing, we currently live in an apartment together. Both of our names are on the lease which ends in November. I have a few options for housing should I decide to end this relationship now- I could save money and move in with my parents, find roommates to live with, or stay in the apartment until the lease ends. If that happens and we decide not to keep the apt., he would most likely move back in with his mom so I'm not worried about him being homeless or anything like that.

But guys, I need help. In my mind I can already picture how a conversation about this would go. I can already picture myself losing my words and ending up having him put blame on me. Please, what do I say to him? How do I stay strong when he starts getting angry? Do I try to have this convo when he gets home today? Do I wait a few days? I'm thinking of going to my parents house to cook today so another option would be for me to leave a note for him to read before I come back, but again what would I say??


Fun side note: one night, after he drank too much and came home belligerent, I was too upset to even try to reason with him especially in his drunken state. I spent the night at my parents house. While I was there, his mom called me and gave me some speech about how partners are supposed to be together through better or worse yadda yadda. I thought that was funny, or fitting, coming from a woman who spent years with a man who abused her and her children and who also had an alcohol / drug problem.



Tl;DR: BF has a drinking problem and I need help formulating the words to say to talk to him about this and possibly end our relationship.

572,Squidward7,Breakups,10,c6j6js,2,"My long distance girlfriend \[21F\] and I \[29M\] broke up two months ago because she ultimately decided she didn't want to move to my area when we got married even though she kept reassuring me for the last year that she would. So distance ultimately drove us apart. We were together 1.5 years and saw each other at least two weekends per month. She's in the Chicago area and I am in the Detroit area. In her case, her brother is autistic and her only other family she has in her state (IL) is her mom and dad. I kept telling her that her brother could live with us in my state (MI) in the future, and she liked that plan. Then, one day, she tells me she can't leave her brother period, and wants me to move there. In a somewhat similar situation, it's hard for me as well because my dad is no longer here and I take my mom isn't in the best of health, and I take her to her doctor appointments. Originally, she said it was only fair for her to move to my area because I had a lot more family than her. I thought we were both happy with the plan, and we agreed to visit her family in Illinois at least twice a month.

&#x200B;

Trying to compromise and save our relationship, I suggested we live somewhere halfway (Kalamazoo, MI). Two hours from our families. I even suggested we live in BOTH states (4 hour drive apart from our families), since my work is flexible and I would be able to split our time in each state and we can get an apartment in both states. She wasn't a fan of it, saying with kids in the future, we wouldn't be able balance both states. So, it's pretty much me move there or we continue to be done as it stands, unless she eventually changes her mind.

&#x200B;

We still talk daily as friends. I know it has only been two months, but I know we still have love for each other and I pray everyday that we have a future together somehow. I'm wondering if I need to just let go of that hope. It's the absolute worst situation ever to be in because we are absolutely best friends and got along so incredibly well. We always said we were each others soulmates.

573,Can-we-talk-about-it,[new],66,c6j4cs,167,"This literally just happened. This male nurse had to come in to check things like my mothers breathing her blood pressure. He checked eveything and said it was fine and after he filled it in in the computer he left. My mother had to go to the bathroom and while she's in the bathroom he entered the room again. He walked up to me, and I immediately put away my phone (which I always do when strangers look at my phone, because I don't like the idea of strangers inserting themselves in my business if I don't invite it first. 

He than says in what seems to be an annoyed voice ""well is that you boyfriend? Is that who you're texting? Your boyfriend"" I look at him confused at what's happening and shake my head no. His mood immediately changes and he says ""well you're really beautiful so why don't you have a boyfriend?"" While walking closer. I feel akward and just say that I'm just focussing on school right now. He than seems angry and abruptly turns arround and leaves. He just kind of stormed out. 

A couple of seconda later my mother enters the room again and she just barely managed to sit down when he enters again with the same equipment less than 5 minites later. Now my mother looks at him oddly but he just starts to put everything in place to check her blood pressure. While he's doing that he keeps asking me questions about ""my studie that shouldn't keep me away from dating people"" and past relationships that I've had and about his relationships and how he is really jist ready. And my mother goes to say something to him and? this ?? dude?? had?? the?? balls?? to ?sssssh??her ??. 

I was like dude don't sush my mother. He literally stayed for about 15 minutes (even though it felt like an hour). My mother's giving him the dead glare right now and he doesn't even notice. And then he grabs everything and leaves without even looking at the numbers or writing it down. 

And now, every time we call for a nurse he comes in even though he doesn't seem to know how to do some of the things he needs to do. There was a device that helps take the fluids out of her lungs and he broke it. Put it on the bed and left 

And then during lunch time he ""helped"" the people who bring the meals to the rooms. He literally just walked with them. While I was eating my lunch with my mother, I just happened to look out of the door and saw him staring back at me in the creepiest way. And I swear that he just walked past our room at least 5 times and he just happened to look into the room every time. 

It's just weird. I wouldn't even care, but when it affects the help my mother gets it pisses me off. She's already in enough pain and she doesn't need to feel more pain so when we call for a nurse I just want someone to be able to help her out. One time I called for a nurse and he walked in and after I explained what's going on he just walked back out without saying anything and after a while I realized that he didn't even call for help even though my mother struggles with breathing and kept coughing and turned red. I presed the button again and thankfully another nurse came who did help her by putting an oxygen machine in.

This is really weird and just uncomfortable for both my mother and I and when I went to call another nurse myself she felt uncomfortable about being alone . So idk what to do about this. Does anyone have a tip?

Edit: he just walked by the room again, entered and said that he had to go now but that he'll ""hopefully"" see us tomorrow. Thankfully my mother's just resting right now and she didn't notice him here. I'm now just hoping tht we are released today. 
I tried to tell nurses (that I like because they know us because we've spend some time in the hospital before). They said that they will try to help us instead, but that they were understaffed today so we couldn't be too picky about who we wanted.
And because I get to stay with my mother the whole day instead of just during visiting hours I don't want them to get mad at me and kick me out cause I don't want to leave her. She also doesn't want to be alone. 

Edit 2: 
He had dropped by and said that he'd leave, and then like 30 minutes later he reappeared in the hospital room, but I was in the bathroom and I only saw him as he left. 
I listened to most of the comments and talked to the nurses again and it was indeed successful. They apologized in his behalf and said that they'll would make sure that we would be helped by other nurses. 

And after a couple of hours the doctor came and said that we could leave today!

574,gduegejxbd,[new],24,c6j1u1,22,"To start off, I have a mental illness so let?s get that out of the way before you read this semi-zany post. Also multiple details have been changed to preserve my anonymity since he uses reddit.
To preface: 

My boyfriend, call him Drew, is a depressed and anxious individual who is currently being treated with meds. Some things got better in our relationship, but he was never one for plans, executing plans, or going out with me unless I initiate. He was okay to come along, though.

I?ve always worked throughout college which allowed me to go out on the weekends once a week and look at museums and do fun things. Not so for boyfriend, who worked 10 hours a week and blew his money pretty fast. Wouldnt last more than a month or two after he decided to stop working. He?s also not as old as the post says, but again it?s to keep anonymous. We are about a month into being fresh out of college and he has not found a job yet, which makes planning things and doing things next to impossible. Obviously this is very little time between graduating and college, which is why I try to be understanding, but not being able to go anywhere with him sucks. We are also long distance and see each other once a week for a few days. He spends $20 in gas to come to mine almost every week, but I also pay for some of his stuff when we go places.


His mom is an amazing career woman, pretty high up in her company. She has always taken care of his living expenses while we were in college, and gone above and beyond for him monetarily (one of the ways she expresses affection). My boyfriend did not have a lot of affection in his childhood, so he?s close to his mom because she gave him the most out of all the people in his childhood.


This week they are going to Florida for a business trip his mom?s company paid for in full for the both of them and I?m really sad, angry, jealous. I know I should be happy Drew is finally getting some sun, enjoying the beach, and hiking through the Everglades. He called to tell his experience and the difference in his tone was amazing. He seemed to be having a good time, as he is usually reserved and into spending time at home. Tonight he and his mum are going to walk along a beach in the evening. They?ve been eating at fancy restaurants (squid, sushi, other super fancy food that he raved about) and driving in fancy sports cars. I?m upset because he promised me this year that we are going to the beach (this entails splitting the costs for driving and hotels and food, which I am 110% happy about because I don?t mind paying). But it?s not going to happen because he has literally 0 money for that. (This is a beach that we can drive to, and is a non fancy resort beach, btw... Think Ocean City, dubbed Ocean Shitty because it?s for poor college grads like him and I :-)) Not only that, but doing things with him in our hometown fucking sucks. I try to get him into museums, walking around, chatting, etc, but he?s never really into it. I?ve asked him to initiate or suggest places but he has only done so a few times. He doesn?t complain or anything when we go out, though. I used to be friends with an ex, who invited me to go canoeing a few days ago. I mentioned it to Drew and he said extremely hurt, ?why don?t we ever go canoeing? you never go canoeing with me?, and I was polite about it but if felt so hurtful because I am always initiating plans, thinking of activities we may like, and figuring out the cost (aka: What?s free to do around my hometown), but he very rarely does anything except choose which movies we watch and where we eat. My ex, who is my good friend and moving away, at least initiates more than my BF does, but they also worked through college and can afford to do things (for the record, I declined to go out of respect for my boyfriend).


I told him, I?m glad you?re having fun at the beach, but I wish it was me.

He said, someday, baby!

And I told him that sucked for me because ?eventually? was such an abstract concept to both me and him, that it?s essentially a way of saying ?maybe, and very low chances at that, maybe in 5 years, maybe 10, maybe it wont happen unless you initiate again and annoy me for it?.
I know I cant expect a lot out of him since he?s depressed and unemployed, but I can?t exactly compete with a sugar mom (literally) who will take her son out and spoil him, and I can?t tell if I?m being irrational or how to overcome these feelings or reason them out. I feel jealous and weird about it, but I?m also a deeply jealous person. He seemed so much happier and alive with her, having talked to her about religion and many other things he never discusses with me. He was so excited and was in sheer awe of Florida/traveling in general, which I?ve been trying to get him to do, but is beyond our ability to pay.

Also due to my mental illness I literally have 0 friends I can go to the beach with, and 0 I?d be willing to take along with me.
I just want to go for a day or two but it looks like I won?t be going this summer.


For the record, let me say both he and his mom are very nice people, and he has dealt with my mental illness to an extent most people wouldn?t (and couldn?t handle).


TL;DR: My depressed, grown boyfriend?s mom is taking him on an extra luxurious all expenses paid trip and he?s having the time of his life, after being quite the housecat l. But I wish it was me, and it hurts for some reason to know he?s having such a great time with her and not me.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend.

&#x200B;

I met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.

&#x200B;

This last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a ""what happens in X, stays in X"" type event.

&#x200B;

It was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.

&#x200B;

The following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.

&#x200B;

Yesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were ""I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you"". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.

&#x200B;

She turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.

&#x200B;

I woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.

I wouldn?t describe our relationship as a perfect one , it had its ups and down but we managed to stay together and I thought It made us stronger. In general we enjoy each other company, we have our fun together and are closer together than many relationships in my community 

It started in the morning where we went to grab some breakfast for us, he asked me what would I like to get. I wanted 2 things one of them is pastry of thyme mixed with olive oil called Zaatar, the other one is minced meat thing. He told me that Last time it was greasy and dripping oil, and it?s for your health he is concerned. I said ok and went to look in the menu to pick something else but nothing was interesting enough so I said ok just the meat one. 
He told me that he will ask them if they can make it lighter. Later on, he said that they can?t change it so what do you want? I was just telling him I?m craving it when he started to say that I don?t listen to his opinions and I always do what I want 
It?s always like that, whether it?s a big decision or small one you don?t listen to my opinion. I?m just gonna save my voice and won?t  suggest anything unless it?s affecting me.

At this moment, we were in the car, I paused for like 6 minutes thinking of what he said (i?m terrible at voicing my ideas so I just think rehearsing what he said in my mind, remembering the incidents where I went with what I wanted to have - recently as an e.g a new job for me and the wedding setting- 

After that long pause I told him ?i?m sorry and I mean it? . He replied that the conversation ended a while ago and he went to pick up our order

While driving back home he decided that he will drop me off at my house, when I saw he was going there I told him that I won?t go there. Reached my house, without saying anything he went out the car and started to walk away his way to his house (our houses is in the same neighborhood like 5 min by car-15 min by walking ) 

When I saw him walking away, I panicked and started to cry. Going inside my house was not a good option as I didn?t went my family to see me in that condition. I?m new to car driving I haven?t got my license yet and I don?t even know how to park it inside the garage. but I decided to follow him with his car. All while I was crying, it was traumatizing for me to do that. Reached his house and went inside with our food, i was shaking . I brought some plates and we started to eat in front of the TV 
For me I was still shaking, sopping tears, I?m not even fully focusing of what?s going on 
For him I don?t know what he was feeling but he said that it felt so good when everyone is doing what he/she want

Also I didn?t bring that damn order of mine, he brought it upstairs and told me to take care of what I?m responsible for.
Finished breakfast and we went to bed, i?m hurt in a way, he is hurt in his way. I told him before I sleep I apologize for not hearing you. 

After waking up , he needed to go out for some matters so I told him to drop me at my home. Since then he called me once to ask me that he is at bookstore and I needed a textbook 
I called him twice once to check with him and he said he is busy, the other one didn?t pick it up

He is a sweet caring person, yet when we have fights I see him as someone else , sometimes I get these ideas, is he controlling and manipulative? 
Or am I the narcissistic sick person to be around ?
I know he is going through a lot lately regarding the job and he is not in the good mood. But something tells is what you did + his stressed self justify what he did ( the walking away )

 I?m currently in my house, should I go to his and approach him or should I wait and see what is going to happen

Okay. So we have been in this relationship for about 5 years now, and this cheating incident happened just a few months after we first got together. There was this girl we both knew who was pretty much pining after my (back then) boyfriend and he told be about it and said that her flirting wasnt working on him. Fast forward a few months it turns out he cheated on me- he told me right after and said they didnt go all the way to home base, but still. We sorted it out over the years. That being said, I always felt he wasnt being truthful about the girl and the nature of their relationship- when I first went out with him he was horny all the time and hung out with her a bit. After the cheating incident they gradually stopped talking after a little less than a year.
I feel like shit for this next part here: The suspicion got too much and I connected to his Facebook- his computer is not password protected in order for me to use it when I can, and hes always logged into his Facebook- I just had to open the tab. I deliberately searched through the messages and found out that they were messaging more than what he told me during the time after the cheating incident, and that the flirting had been working on him because he messaged her a few weeks prior to the whole cheating thing that he said something he didnt mean and ""didnt want to act on it"", then saying he wished he never said anything in the first place.
My fear is that their relationship was a lot more involved than just friends, and that he was actually responding to her flirtations (some got physical ex: stealing his car keys so he would pin her against the wall to get them back- he actually told me that) and lied to me about it. I also fear that between us getting together and the cheating incident, it was all just a buildup that I could have stopped if I hadn't been so naive.
I feel awful about invading his privacy due to suspicions so I havent said anything. This cheating thing happened a while ago so I dont know if its work bringing up, and if its valid to still feel like this. In the grand scheme of things this issue is small compared to others which is also making me doubt myself. I hate being vulnerable to people and I find it hard to trust easily, so that's probably why I'm reacting so strongly.
What should I do? Keep quiet or bring it up? I just feel more betrayed and I cant believe I was so stupid.

TL:DR After a cheating incident (didnt go to home base) at the start if our relationship, I found out my fiance's relationship to the girl he cheated on me with may have been more involved than I thought, and I found out by invading his FB privacy.

We had a few ups and downs mostly revolving around an ex bf of Zoe. recently one of my close friends confronted me over something I said to my past fling so naturally I confronted past fling about it. Previously I had spoken to past fling twice since the start of my relationship, once when her father passed away she texted me about it and I gave my condolences, and the other was on Fathers day, she texted me again because of the first situation made her depressed and again I offered my condolences through text. Today I confronted my fling about something she said to someone she had been dating and threw my name out there about what I had said. Zoe's ex bf caught wind of it, screenshot the text past fling sent  when she threw my name out and showed Zoe. Zoe asked me if I was still talking to said fling and I told the truth, I had 3 different conversations with past fling. she immediately broke up with me saying I was playing both sides by texting her.  


My entire conversations with fling amount to about 15 texts. I have tried to give an apology for not telling her sooner, however I have not apologized for giving my condolences. I don't understand how the situation could have escalated this quickly from what transpired and the only two things that my gut is telling me is she wanted out of the relationship or since the problems in the past came from Zoe's ex bf, Zoe now see's the chance to take something I've done and run with it. Red flag? Am I overlooking something on my part. looking for any advice

580,grusel_cookie,[new],2,c6i02n,2,"My mother grew up with three sisters in a super catholic and strict house with a (in my opinion) terrible mother and a silent father. No freedom, everyone had to listen to the mother and stick with her rules.

My mother, the third child, always fought for more freedom. Grandma didn't like my father when mom met him but mom chose him over her mother which caused big drama back then including no contact between mother and her family for a few weeks and many fights (I wasn't born but I was told). The problem was that my father didn't have a proper family, his father died when dad was just born and his mother was very poor. Eventually, grandma would accept him (mainly because she had to realise she could not control mom anymore) and he forgave everything that happened because he thinks forgiving is right and family in general is very important to him since he always had just his mother.

When I was about 12 I think, grandpa turned out to be alcoholic. My mother was really upset about that, but I felt like the other sisters didn't really care or pretended it wasn't a real problem. However, he managed to quit that. 

The other sisters all live near my grandparents with their families in a rural area. My mother moved away so we visited the family about once a year or so. I myself moved 3 years ago even further, so I didn't always join my parents visiting and I never had the idea to visit them by my own. 

The communication in this family was always super weird. They don't talk about issues at all. Mom promised herself she wouldn't repeat her own mothers mistakes and that's why we had great communication in our little family (me, my siblings and parents). I admire her and love her very much because I know how hard it was to fight with herself and her beliefs to become this independend and I think she is a great mother, especially compared to her own upbringing.
But she still keeps this weird peace with her parents. Visiting them and pretending to enjoy it (which she doesn't). I get that, she doesn't want to fight when it's not necessary and she doesn't want to cut them off without real reasons and she loves her parents and sisters.

But I don't. I don't love my grandparents at all. I don't really have a relationship with my grandpa, I think we never realy talked to each other. And grandma... I see what her terrible attitude and parenting did to my mother (I don't want to go in detail on that now) and apart from that I just don't like her personality, which is not her fault, we are just pretty different.

My lifestyle in general is pretty different to the whole family. I heard them talking half joking about vegetarianism like an illness, i'm vegan. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins are all very religious, I don't really care. I live in a big city and study computer science and they don't really get what that even is. I like experimenting (sex, drugs), they still live this old school rural life. Which is totally fine but combined with this athmosphere of not talking about problems and differences it creates an environment I feel very uncomfortable in.

When I visit my grandparents with my family I pretend I enjoy it even if my parents know I don't really (we talked about that). My father thinks family is very important and my mother loves them.

So, my grandpa will turn 80 in a few weeks. My mother and my father like me to go to the birthday party, which will be a big barbecue with people I don't like, music I don't like and food I don't like. I will have to travel 5 hours by train to my parents and then 2 hours with them by car. On the other hand, I know that my grandpa is very emotional and I don't want to hurt him even if I don't really know him. And I very much don't want my mother to be upset. She told me he has growing health issues and it's possible that this is the last chance to see him that healthy and to talk to him. But honestly, I don't really care about that. Does this make me a bad person? ""family"" is just a word to me. I never bound with this people. But I really love my parents and care about them. I believe my father thinks i'm selfish and cold hearted when I say I don't care about my grandpa and don't want to go to his 80's birthday party ""just because they don't have vegan food"".
I really don't want to go. Am I allowed to refuse? Does it make me selfish? Do I have to care about family even if they are as different as they could be?

Tl;dr
I love my parents and they want me to attend my grandpas 80's birthday party which I don't want to since I don't like the people.

The uncertainty of how they feel (constant hot and cold), wanting to show you off, he directly compared my appearance to this girl saying we look similar, moving WAY too fast, etc. I asked him about it and he didn?t deny it. I asked him if he still really likes her and he said he still does, and on a very deep level. He said that he doesn?t feel that way very much anymore but that he could if he started over with her again. I am at such a loss and in so much pain. This was my first ever real relationship sort of thing and I was not expecting this outcome. I still really feel so much affection bordering on love for him and this really really hurts.

582,foxape,[new],6,c6hssp,2,"So to start with my girlfriend has lied to me once in the past (that I know of), over money. She has also ""secretly"" hung out with other guys while we were dating. By that I mean not really keeping it a secret but not telling me about it or doing it around me either. And not guys that she knew from before we met either. So we have a history of fighting and being mad/sad at each other but we have been dating for a year and two months. When she's not disrespecting me or our relationship she's really a beautiful person and I really do love her and love spending time with her. 

Now my question is am I being insecure by being sad when she hangs out with other guys by herself and doesn't tell me? I don't do the same thing to her, matter of fact I would never think of hanging out with another girl alone without my girlfriend. It just wouldn't seem right. Maybe I'm wrong. Anyways a few months ago I moved out of the house we were living in to a different city about an hour and a half away. Since then the relationship has basically been in the toilet. She doesn't return my calls except for late at night when she needs help falling asleep. She takes several hours to respond to texts, when I know she's on her phone, which leads to me feeling unwanted/unloved and feeling like I'm bugging her. I see her on snapchat hanging out with other guys with her friends and calling him ""her baby"". I ask her about the guy and she says he's a ""new friend"". Yeah she's always getting a lot of guy ""new friends"". Keep in mind these aren't just any guys, she is specifically attracted to hot white guys and surprise surprise, all her ""guy friends"" fall into that category. Am I being selfish by feeling sad about this? I have to find out about all these guy friends by accident and it just feels like she's hiding them from me. Please tell me if I am being immature and insecure because I do not know what to do and I desparately need an objective perspective.

I lost my Dad on the 6th of June and I'm utterly broken about it. I've already had 1 fall out with my Mum since he passed away as she wanted to bring my Step-dad to the funeral but I said no (there is a post all about it in my reddit history) but last night I was going through some of my Dads paper work and came across the letters from the divorce (he kept everything). 

I sat and read and cried. She took him for everything! She cheated on him which is mentioned in the papers but blamed him in the divorce just so she could have half of everything. She tried to take half his pension off him and also sent dept collectors to the house when he didn't pay up in very short time frames she gave him. My heart broke all over again for my Dad.

- I don't care if he intends to *just* have sex or interested in platonic. Woman and man having sex is not equal to woman getting *used* by man. Don't assume I wouldn't also just want casual sex.
- I don't care if he will or will not leave his wife. It's not like I expect anything that serious to begin with. Don't straight go assume I'm serious while he intends to *use* me.
- Please do let me know if there is any way to think this is a good friendship. Although I guess no one here has been able to think that way so far..








I've been a little confused recently about a coworker[37M] who has been very friendly with me[22F]. Things check a lot of boxes. How can I tell if he is just being a good friend or interested in me? 

tl;dr + background
He is a 30-something male, married but has no kids(and no plans for kids). I am 22 female, a recent college grad, and we work in an engineering field. We recently started talking to each other a lot. It started more like mentoring as he is senior to me in the field and much more knowledgeable in everything. However things got unexpectedly different. I'm kind of new to industry so I'm unsure if what's happening is normal between coworkers who are friends. (If this was in college and with an unmarried person, I'd have concluded that he's interested for sure)




- We started chatting a lot about our personal life and discovering common interests and sharing each of us's interests (like music, books etc) 
- And we did that for hours at the office after everyone else leaves. Until 9pm or even 10pm. (Most of our team members leave between 5 and 6. He seems to be workaholic so he used to stay a little late at work.)
- I was worried if I was interrupting his work too much and taking his time unprofessionally. But he even hinted to talk after regular work hours when he had some news.
- He has made some disparaging comments and showed some disappointment about his current relationship. (Nothing in rude way - some foundational differences between him and his partner in terms of lifestyle)
- Past few days, we'd even chat on our work messenger until like 2am.
- More importantly, he does message me first to say something not related to work. Most surprising one was when he pinged me at around midnight to say how it was a long day and kinda to say goodnight I think, although the conversation continued for an extra hour after he said he's going to bed. 
- This could sound a bit silly... he downloaded an app to share a field of interest with me. You could automatically add all your facebook friends on the app but he only added me. I was a bit surprised by this.
- He'd give me this cute smile whenever he sees me with no one else around or whenever we look at each other over the cubes. 


However
- First of all, he's married.  
- And we are coworkers.  
- I can't compare if he treats me differently than other girls. We don't have other girls in the team. I can never see him interacting with other girls.  
- He has acted very very gentle since the beginning where we weren't close - has traditional English gentleman manners. He's very respected by the entire team as well. This somehow makes me feel like he would never take any interest in women other than his wife and would stay loyal.   


I know I would get a lot of criticism for this, but I do feel like I want to get to know him better and spend more time close. I wouldn't say anything clearly over boundries first or act upon my feelings. I'm happy even as it is - having conversations with him and stuff, and don't want to make mistakes and destroy the relationship with him. I respect and admire him, after all. I just would love to know if reddit thinks he is acting like friends at work or more than that, just to stop questioning myself every night.",1561708221.0,Is this married coworker [37M] just being a good friend to me[22F] or interested in me?,0.41

&#x200B;

Because of schedule conflicts, we've only seen each other a couple of times, but we've done a lot of chatting over text, way more than I've done with anyone else I've met on Tinder. He compliments me a lot, touches me a lot in public (respectfully & with consent), texts me almost every day, and suggests plans for us to do together in the future. These things as well as some other little comments he's made led me to believe that he was most likely looking for a relationship with me.

&#x200B;

The last time we hung out, we hooked up. He suggested we take a trip together. Everything felt very normal and sweet except I was a little worried that I overstayed my welcome at his place. I stayed about an hour after we woke up in the morning. I complimented him more than I normally would in person but felt comfortable doing so because he seemed to feel the same about me.

&#x200B;

After this, his texts have been much less enthusiastic and he doesn't do as much to keep the conversation going. I have this sinking feeling that he is losing interest or that something I did when we hung out turned him off. :(

I want to ask him if everything is okay but I'm worried that if he really is losing interest, this will just push him away more. Maybe I'm just spiraling because I've gotten my hopes up and been ghosted before?

1. When you feel someone's tone change, should you say something or just see how it plays out?

589,throwaway161099,[new],10,c6hb8g,3,"My (F19) boyfriend (M22) and I are university students, we met at college last year. We've been together a bit over a year. He moved out into a share house at the start of this year in the city where our university is and I still live at university on campus, but my hometown is an hour away from the city.


He is very ambitious, he studies hard around exams and gets high distinctions. He also works 2 days a week during the semester. He's adjusted to living independently very well, however at times our relationship has been pressured by him being very busy and not leaving time to see me.


We finished our exam block last week, which was a week of revision and 2 weeks of exams. During this time we saw each other about every 1.5 weeks as he went back to his hometown to study and we were both generally very busy. I made the effort to drive to his hometown in the revision week for just over 24 hours after we had a bit of a fight about seeing each other. Around this time he kept saying that after exams were over we'd go and spend time at both our hometowns for a few days each. I was really looking forward to spending this time together, stress-free and after quite a bit of time apart.


At the beginning of this week he found out for the month uni break he'll be working 4 weekdays with wednesday's off. This initially really upset me because it means we can't really spend time together at our hometowns like I'd been looking forward to. I tried to be supportive and didn't express how disappointed I was because he's just doing what he needs to do to support himself. 

Last night I stayed at his house because I was in the city seeing other friends. Staying at his place was a bit spontaneous and we'd been talking about him coming to my place on Saturday (tomorrow) as I'm going away for the following week. Things were normal and we didn't really talk about the sudden change of plans due to his work schedule. This morning I asked if he was still coming to my home tomorrow and he said he wasn't sure because he'd only be there for 24 hours and it's an hour drive. 


I reminded him about when I drove to his hometown 2 weeks ago, which is a 2 hour drive. I told him I would be upset if he didn't make the effort to come tomorrow because I'm going away and we've still barely seen each other. 

He then explained that the reason he doesn't want to come is because he has to do some gardening with one of his housemates (the others have already gone home) before that housemate goes home on Monday- otherwise my boyfriend will have to do it alone.  

To me this is a bit ridiculous. I'm patient with how much he studies during the semester, I've been patient with him working a lot now we're on break. Now he can't even come see me before I go away for a week because he wants to 'garden'- which he could pay $20 for someone else to do. 

After arguing a bit he started saying he'd just have to come see me and he didn't have a choice because I was forcing him to come. I said that was a bad idea and I only wanted him to come if he wanted to- I'll never nag someone to see me. We couldn't properly talk because he had to go to work so he said he'd message, which he didn't do on his break. 

I really love him and I think it's unique to find a young man so responsible and driven. But I'm almost at my breaking point with not ever being a priority or getting to spend quality time together away from a shitty share house in the city. 

I almost feel like there's another reason he doesn't want to come but he had said several times that's what he wanted to do when we were on break. I don't know whether to just say it seems like he's too busy for a relationship (which I've said before and he has been adamant he wanted to make it work). 

I need some advice about what to say. Do I push him to come tomorrow or leave it and just have some space while I'm away? Has anyone been in this situation where it's like the right person but the wrong time?

590,GodlyPumpkin,Non-Romantic,7,c6ha8m,2,"My brother throws a fit whenever I express that I'm not so excited by his girlfriend. Whenever the two of them are together they are extremely inappropriate with their pda, and being his big sister i find it very disrespectful that they both feel comfortable groping each other in my presence. A prime example would be about a few weeks ago when she came over to our house and my brother insisted that I play Mario party with them. I was totally down for it, and was actually excited. It was enjoyable until they both sprawled out on the couch on top of each other less than five feet away from me. My brother laid basically on his back and she laid across his chest just barely sitting upright and the both of them were kissing and caressing each other non-stop. It was SO uncomfortable. I wanted to just leave the game but if I did they'd have to start all over and I knew it'd be a big scene. Things got progressively worse as he LITERALLY started to stroke her stomach with his hand underneath her shirt, and she jokingly bumped into his ding dong and the two of them giggled and whispered about. All the while I was five feet away or less. Their behavior would have been disrespectful to do even in front of a peer, and I am his BIG SISTER. I addressed it later that evening with my mom who then talked to my brother about it. He was defensive for a long time until he finally came around to admitting that it was disrespectful. I'm not traditional by any means, but they were basically groping each other and hanging all over each other like they might in private.

Now this evening my brother came into the kitchen and told my mom that his girlfriend's father said that they could hang out but only if she came over to our house. This is really common of her dad to do, he doesn't care if they hang out as long as my mother does all the work to make it happen; picking her up and taking her home, etc. That irks me, and in addition to that I just don't like it when she comes over because I feel uncomfortable in my own house because of how inappropriate they are in my presence. So I half jokingly, and dramatically said ""WHYYY?!"" after my brother said that she would be coming over. He had his phone in his hand and I didn't know they were on a call because he didn't mention it so he attacked me for being rude to her even though I feel I have every right to be irritated that she's coming over. About an hour later my dad came in the kitchen while I was cooking and took one of the last few muffins I baked. I thought I only had one or two left that I planned on eating for breakfast tomorrow, so when five minutes passed and my brother came into the kitchen asking if we still had muffins left I grumbled under my breath. My mom asked him why to which he replied he wanted to give one to his girlfriend. Thinking I only had one or two (little) muffins left I immediately said ""No."". For the second time I was unaware they were on a call and she could hear me so my brother flipped his lid and ranted about how I just HATE his girlfriend for no reason, and that I'm super mean to her even though I've never been anything but nice to her when we're face to face. How was I supposed to know they were on the phone?

Am I wrong for finding their amount of affection in my presence and other family members disrespectful? And for expressing my irritation when my brother says she's coming over? My brother says I'm just a jerk to her and that she tries really hard to make me like her, but don't you think if she really wanted me to like her she wouldn't grope him when I'm sitting right next to them? On multiple occasions my mother has had to talk to my brother about their pda; what's appropriate and what's not, and he's claimed that he's relayed the message to her so don't you think they should both know better at this point?

Now if anyone here has worked on cruise ships, you will know how it goes - lots of parties, drinking and late nights, and lets just say i had lots of fun in the first half of my 9 month contract. I ended up sleeping with someone after a night of partying and it happened twice (same person).
 
After this i kinda got a wake up call and realised that that is not what i wanted to be doing, and that what i left behind at home was actually what i really wanted so i worked out the rest of my contract, came home and my boyfriend then proposed to me. We had been engaged for a few years and earlier this year called it off, we had a few trust issues and are trying to work on this now.

I have your average deadbeat father. Father of three, ?dad? to none. I haven?t spoken to the man since I officially cut him out 7 years ago, and haven?t properly come face to face with him in almost 8 years despite living in the same small town of 80,000.

I want to shake it off and get on with my life as I always have. Nothing will change for me if he never resurfaces aside from always wondering what happened...but damnit, the bastard is in my head. 

Also my mom said something that got in my head. She texted me, ?Thought it was better to tell you myself before the rumour mill starts trying to aim in your direction.?

I was the only guy she ever dated more than two months. We communicated pretty well and we definitely were both on board. I go to college out of the city so it was long distance mostly with weekly visits of three days ish with a few longer stretches. 

I came home for summer and I am kinda in charge of our social circle and how we plan events through an app, and she was pretty controlling of who we let in the app. A girl who she despised but other people liked was invited and she was constantly on me about ditching her. I handled it with as much patience as I could and it was resolved. I told everyone we'd wait a little longer before adding people. Fast forward and an old high school friend gets added and she randomly blows up about it, I had no idea they couldn't get along and just snapped. after that, I would say mean things without meaning too, I was just resentful I guess. My big mistake was when I tried talking her into going to the gym and said ""I like skinny"" you cannot say this to a woman, I meant fit and really only cared about having a gym buddy and trying to motivate her but it didn't matter. A little bit of time passed and I apologized and was trying but it kept eating at her. Eventually, she asked for a week break then broke it off saying she just couldn't shake it. We ended on good terms but it was odd after hearing for months how ""I was the one"" and she wanted to get married hella soon, with me pumping the breaks and trying to tell her we probs need to wait longer.

I came to Japan several months ago (around the beginning of March I arrived here). I met several people pretty quickly and one of the friends I met at my university is F (I will just call her F).

We were pretty good friends getting lunch together often, constantly talking to each other in the one class we had, and just overall it felt like a really healthy relationship.

About a month ago she said that her boyfriend was jealous of me and didn't want us sitting together (I knew this felt like a toxic relationship they had and what not), but I didn't say anything and just kind of agreed and went to just having our occasional lunch and talking and such.

However, in the past 3 weeks or so, it seems we never have real conversations anymore and all she ever talks about is her boyfriend. Just constantly complaining about her boyfriend, and everything he does, and how she doesn't want to be with him anymore. I tried giving advice and understanding where she is coming from, but nothing ever changes and Ifeel like we aren't friends anymore.

5 months. Me [M24] Girl 1 [F23] and I met in March 2016. Initially, I wasn?t interested in her romantically or sexually. However, after a few weeks of hanging out (her best friend and my best friend were dating) it came up that she is from CA and had been applying for jobs. I remember then thinking ?okay so she?s not looking for anything serious, cool? and that?s when thongs took off. We started hooking up and went on dates. Next thing I know, it?s 3-4 months down the road and she tells me she?s moving in two weeks.
I then remember thinking ?oh fuck?, by now I had feelings and so did she. We never talked about a relationship because we would be starting the relationship long distance, we knew it wouldn?t work. 
I went and visited her a couple times and we had a great time. We were really drunk hooking up out in CA and she said she loved me, I froze, and then she said ?no like a friend?. I still don?t know if she covered it up because I didn?t respond well, she truly meant she enjoyed my friendship, or we were just fucked up and in the moment. Haven?t talked about it, and never more than a casual DM on IG anymore. 

5ish Months. Me [M25] Girl 2 [F22] and I met in January of 2017 because she is the sister of a friend of mine. We didn?t match on bumble until August 2017. We casually went on dates and hung out when I was in town. We weren?t physical until November (I travel a ton for work) after we had gone down to a music festival in Orlando and came back to the Midwest. 
A week after that she tells me her job offered her to move to PA and she was going. She moved in a month. Well, naturally that?s when we started hooking up more consistently. I was a bit confused because I didn?t think she was super into me, but that was changing quickly. She moved and we still texted and chatted via phone. We met up in Denver for NYE for a music festival and never left each other?s side. I stayed with her both nights and she left for her flight @ 4am. 
We made plans for me to come up and visit in February after that. Her time in PA was temporary, unlike Girl 1, and I thought hey this could work. Up until 3 weeks before I am supposed to visit. She FaceTimed me on Saturday and everything was great. She had posted that another guy, who she told me was a friend *Homer Simpson DOH sound* and I believed it. Well she doesn?t respond to text for a week and I?m getting sketched. I called her and we chatted and she said everything was fine and she was excited for me to visit, I bought tickets for a concert for us. 
2 weeks to go and no communication, she posts about a trip to FL to see IG guy and I knew what it was. So I texted her the week I was coming because I?d be in NJ for work that entire week and fly from there to PA. She tells me she needs to call me. I wait two days and no call, so I called her and asked her what is going on. She says she thinks she?s been leading me on, and I said why?s that? She said she just didn?t know if it would work, I told her I get it that there?s another guy but she just needed to be honest with me.
That one hurt pretty bad. Flight was non-refundable so I had a friend drive down and we hung out in PA for the weekend. 

11 Months. Me [M27] Girl 3 [F29] and I matched on bumble in June 2018. We met up for beers and she brought her dog. We hit it off and I asked for a second date quickly. We met up for a concert in town, (her choice and one of her fav artists) we went and got drinks beforehand and ended up talking so long we missed 3/4 of the show. It gets a little weird, but Girl 1 and I are just friends now and she was back in KC in October and asked if I wanted to get dinner. We got dinner and I told her about Girl 3 and that things were actually really good for the first time in awhile. I knew I was smitten. 
At this point my job was sucking. I was traveling all the time and felt like just another body. Girl 3 and I both expressed that we have both had thoughts of moving away from KC and seeing other areas of the country. We visited Denver together as an option in November a month after we made our relationship exclusive. I loved it, she liked it. Not an option, at this point we saw it as an us move and doing it together. I somewhat had my heart set on Denver.
Our jobs got worse and worse through the holidays and then in February I got a promotion. Work got better and my desire to move went down. Not hers. She throws out San Diego and I was open to it, I love SD. But my job had gotten better and I wasn?t as open to moving as her desire was. 
Between November and March our relationship was getting stronger and stronger. It had been 5 years (senior year of college) since I had called someone my girlfriend and dated someone exclusively. She is the first person I told ?I love you? too. I was shaking when I said it and she said she knew she loved me too. At this point I?m all in. She has helped me through doing boyfriend things better, being more thoughtful, and giving her what she needed in our relationship. 
Then in May she went to visit her gay best friend in NYC, when she came back (in retrospect it all seems so clear) it seemed different. When I asked her about moving, she had changed her mind from SD to NYC and that would be too much for me. So time continues going by and we get to late May. I?m on the road and we were texting and I asked if she figured anything out with her lease and she said she worked out a deal to go month to month through September. This is now her set date to move and she wants to talk about it. 
In this time her best friend in NYC has moved to LA w/ his boyfriend. Now her final decision is to move to LA because two of her best friends are there also. I texted her back while I was on the road about it and said I still see this as an US thing and throw out ideas about me going remote with my job or doing long distance. She responds that after our last moving talk (the week after she visited NYC) she?s seen this as more of a ME thing. 
We talk about it after I get back that weekend and pretty much come to the conclusion that I wouldn?t be moving to LA if that?s where she wanted to go. So I asked her what she was thinking with our relationship, would she want to do long distance or should we end it? She said she couldn?t promise that it wouldn?t cause a strain on our relationship when she moves but she wants to do distance. 
After this talk, she starts getting easily irritated. I have been in KC only two full work weeks since April 15th and those weeks with her she was very irritable. I called her out on the way she talks to me last Thursday and she acknowledged that she wasn?t treating me well, that had to change, and she doesn?t know why she?s been so irritable lately. 
It spirals and Sunday we had a talk and she acknowledged that she had been distancing herself from me and building up walls. I asked why and she said deep down she doesn?t think long distance would work. I asked her if she was 100% committed to our relationship and she said she wasn?t right now. I recommended that we end things now because the negativity toward me and distancing over the last month had brought me to a new low. 
We are meeting next week for a little closure but I just want her to take accountability for giving up on our relationship. I?ve been supportive of the move the entire way through and brought up how we could make it work.  We will see what happens there. 

TL;DR I have dated three girls, each more seriously than the next, and each one has decided to move away from me.

My whole question here is, why do I keep putting myself in this position? Do I see that as non-commital?

However, our personalities match well, so I become good friends with him and his bros. We both had other relationships lasted longer than 6 months after that. I couldn?t fall in love with my bf because there?s no strong feeling developing. And he couldn?t love his gf because she?s crazy and made him emotionally exhausted. Anyway, we both become single recently.

The thing is, I only like a certain type of guys, so I barely develop feelings for guys. He?s the 3rd and the most recent one in my 27 years.

My boyfriend is Pagan. We spoke about this in the early stages of our relationship, and it certainly doesn?t bother me. In fact, I?ve taken a great interest and feel that my own personal beliefs likely fall under that category. 

My family, however, are die-hard Christians. I grew up in the church, and watched my parents morph into the kind of people who flaunt their religion, thinking it makes them better than others, and just generally turn into hypocrites. I?ve hated these aspects of my parents faith for many years before meeting my bf. 

So the issue at hand. My boyfriend posted a meme on Facebook and was antagonistic towards Christians. It was a meme, so it was fairly lighthearted but my parents really took it personally and decided to comment on his post saying how ?everyone can think what they want? but they are disappointed and a bunch of other shit. 

This is one of many attacks on my boyfriend, and while I understand he IS the one who posted the meme, my parents comments were out of line as he has never once said anything against their faith. 

Should I insert myself and defend my boyfriend against my parents? Should I ask him just to ignore them? How do I support him without making this explode into something even bigger? I am afraid that he will feel like I am choosing them over him, when that truly isn?t the case. Thanks in advance

607,slam_24,Dating,4,c6fzn3,2,"So currently I'm stuck in a situation with this girl (17) whom I'm (17) deeply in love with. We were friends for three years until last week when I asked her out. She said 'Yes, that would be fun' After I suggested we see a movie and get lunch. Since this was the first time I have ever asked someone out, I was really happy. But she followed up with 'Can't this weekend because I have plans already but maybe next week for the holidays?'. I was fine with that, still overwhelmed with joy and anxiety. 

So the day after I began to notice the first problem. She stopped sending me Snapchat streaks. But of course I'm not someone who cares whether someone keeps a streak with me or not, so I did not fret. But I also didn't Snapchat her at all over the weekend because I thought she may be busy, and I felt that my mission was already accomplished after she agreed to go out with me.

So school starts again and I immediately notice that she was acting differently in class. She sat with her friend group as usual but didn't even turn to my table to even look at me or say anything. After class, I held the door open for everyone and she just walked on through without saying anything or looking at me. I even said 'hey' to her, but she ignored me. Now since I'm a shy kid I didn't try to press her for an answer because I found no welcoming gesture to even try to start a conversation. It was awkward because it had been happening all week. Leading up to the weekend, we still haven't said a word to each other and all these thoughts were flooding my mind so texting her about it seemed awkward. I began questioning our friendship; I began to think that she was just talking to me out of pity or something like that. But I had known her very well for three whole years, so nothing made sense. Out of respect, I didn't question her about it. Maybe it was me being too nervous and scared to confront her but I just kept telling myself to 'just wait and she'll say something to me and it'll be all bueno'.

So it's now Friday and I can't decide whether to randomly ask her over Snapchat; 'So I know we don't talk and you pretend I'm invisible, but are you still up for that date?'. Because it's just soo awkward and I know that after all this, I'm going to lose a friend.

Should I forget about it and move on knowing that I lost a friend and replaced her with a stranger also knowing that one day I'll have to partner up with her in class to have a horribly awkward time? Or should I act awkward and pretend that she never acted like this and just ask her about our plans for the weekend? Is any of this normal? Have I done something wrong? Is it because I'm too shy and not boyfriend material? How do I stop my friends from bothering me about this, because I can't build up the strength to tell them that I screwed it up and there is no date? Help...

TL:DR 
I was suppose to have a date this weekend with this girl but my shy and awkward self has allowed for a awkward silence between us leading up to the date. I?m starting to doubt myself and I think she agreed to go out because she was just being nice. Should I forget about it and not make plans and remind her?

608,YoungStupidity,[new],3,c6fup4,2,"I (18m) have been on and off dating this girl (18f) for the past... almost 2 years now and I've made some poor decision while I wasn't with her. Mainly being, getting involved with other girls. Last summer I decided that our relationship wasn't going anywhere and that it was time to move on. My friend introduced me to a girl and we stayed together for the summer until she went off to school. During this time I was rude to my ex, the girl I have been dating on and off with. Out of spite for the true reason I don't know I started to tell her how me and this new girl had had sex and how much I loved her and all these things that you would hate to hear from the person that just broke up with you. I admit that by doing this I was the biggest a-hole on the planet and was rightfully confronted about it. In the fall me and my ex decided to get back together and have been going strong until about 3 days ago. I post regularly to my Instagram story about things and one day the girl from the summer responded and I had a 2 text conversation with her and that's all. My current girlfriend saw this thread of messages and flipped out. After this she proceeded to read through my texts with my good friends and she stumbled upon a text about the summer girl and how I miss her and how I said ""nothing will ever be the same."" However that text wasn't recently. She then told me to get out of the car and left me in a shopping plaza (It was a fair punishment). I get that I shouldn't have said that at all but I did and I'm trying to hold onto my girlfriend before she leaves for college. She wants to know why I said those things but when I say that the words have no meaning and that I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart she calls me childish and tells me I'm not ready for a committed relationship. I really love this girl and want nothing more in the world than to hold onto her until she is forced to go. I know I'm a shitty person, I just want this to end when it has to and it not to feel like she's ripping herself away from me.

609,PopularCabinet,Relationships,7,c6frev,4,"First of all, this is a burner account, just because I feel like this situation is a little weird and I don't want people i'm close to to know about it really.

The ages in this are also their current ages, not the ages that we met at.

Well, I (17 M) am into acting and musical theater so I've been going to this musical theater summer camp for a few years.  My first year there, there was this girl (14 F) that I met and I thought she was pretty cool and all, we became fast friends because we shared a lot of the same interests, but starting from the last year I went to this summer I feel like I might have fallen in love with this girl. I feel all the telltale signs (or so I've heard) of love.  I get excited and nervous even just thinking about her, I freeze up just being near her, When I wake up and sleep I think about her.  It's nothing like any of the other ""crushes"" I have had in the past.  Mainly, my advice request is should I attempt something with this? I'm going to be a senior next year, and she is going to be a freshman at a different (but still relatively close) school.  My main worry is if the age gap is too large.  I have never been in a relationship before so I don't know how it might turn out, but I don't want to ask her out, and her say yes only for it to have to end because I'm going to college and she is still in High School.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - I think I'm in love with a girl who is younger than me and I don't know if its worth pursuing anything.

P.s. if it helps at all, I do think that its possible that she likes me.  Even outside of the summer camp we talk, and her best friend is convinced that she has a crush on me, but in an environment like the cast of a play it can seem like that with anybody.

610,leodoner,[new],5,c6fqol,3,"This has been on my mind for a while. We've been together around 6 months now. I love him a lot, but lately he seems so uninterested in me.

When I ask him to spend some time together all he wants to do it sit and watch TV. Which is fine, but he never wants to go out for anything anymore. The last time we went on a date was probably easily more than 2 months ago. I've brought this up to him and he always says its because we don't have a lot of money to be going on dates. This is true, we both live paycheck to paycheck, but we also live in the city. There's plenty of free things to do. I've sent him links and pictures of places I wanna visit but he always just brushes me off or says ""oh, cool we'll go there soon"" and never brings it up again.

We also just don't really have sex anymore, and when we do it seems like he just wants to get it over with. He doesn't do foreplay, doesn't really touch me or say anything or switch positions the whole time. It didn't used to be like that at all. We had a wonderful sex life. But these last 2 months have been real dry. Again, I've brought this up and he says it because I never initiate sex and he's tired of having to do that all the time. I don't think this is true at all. Anytime I try to initiate he rolls over and goes to sleep or just gets up out of bed.  And to be completely honest, I don't even want to initiate anymore because when we do have sex its just..... kinda boring now.

It's all been taking a toll on me. The other night I found myself sobbing about it all and was feeling so defeated. I found myself thinking about a former FWB and almost even contacted him. I'm not proud of it, and I do not want to cheat. I love my boyfriend, and I want things to get better. That's why I decided to make this post. I'm not sure how to go about this. I'm not sure what other conversations I should be having with him. Any help or opinions would be appreciated :-)

611,solardiat,[new],18,c6fpvz,0,"So, I will start this off by saying that I have developed a major fear of people. This isn't like introversion, it's a complete aversion to interacting with people individually. Crowds and public speaking don't phase me, but I constantly feel threatened and trapped by frequent text messages from friends (even if it just says something basic and pleasant like a joke or a nice comment) and when I hang out with someone one-on-one in person for more than a couple hours, it will take me around a week to mentally recover from the strain. If I have to do something like that again in the week, I start spiraling and get full-tilt suicidal and develop self-harming tendencies because I feel subconsciously trapped. Somehow, despite this obvious social handicap, I have online friends who I meet up with a few times a year and a new boyfriend who really loves me.

The problem is that he loves me TOO MUCH.

On the first date, he IMMEDIATELY took me to a company function to meet his coworkers, his parents, his sister and her husband, his aunts, his uncles, and his four cousins. After that, the VERY NEXT DAY, we hung out for around SIX HOURS with his sister and her husband. The day after that, he wanted me to come to his house for a family dinner so I could meet his grandparents, but I was leaving for a trip so I cancelled. (Thank god.) When I was on the trip, since I had no cutting implements (we were flying) in despair I slowly sawed a deep notch into my forearm using a plastic knife from Wendy's. (You know, the flimsy type in the plastic wrapper that comes with your food.) Luckily, since we were gone so long (half a month), I recovered away from people and my phone (no wifi) so I was able to control myself, and I re-established text conversation with my boyfriend.

Unlucky me, as soon as I got back I had two month-long condensed summer courses starting at the same time that were both really important for my major, so I mostly ignored my social media for that month while I was working my ass off and I was just letting the messages pile up because they were making me really anxious on top of my schoolwork.

A week into ignoring the messages, I get a fucking knock on my door. It's him- standing there at my front door with a dozen white roses in a bouquet in hand like this is The Notebook or some shit. My hands immediately start shaking and I'm sure my face was as white as those roses. I was in my pajamas and I hadn't washed my hair in three days. I was basically having an internal panic attack as I opened the door and my brain turned to soup at this point, so I don't remember anything that was said. I politely shooed him back into his car and numbly put the flowers in water. Every time I caught sight of them I started nervously shaking because of the pressure of the expectations he unknowingly put on me, so after a day or so I gave them to my mom to put them somewhere where I didn't have to stare at them all day.

I replied to a few of his texts after that, declined to hang out, and told him in no uncertain terms that I would not be able to hang out for the rest of this month because I had classes to finish. Yet, he still kept texting me THE WHOLE MONTH which sent my anxiety through the roof. I still haven't opened the messages.

It is now the end of the month. I just took my finals today and yesterday, and I got an 85 and a 98 in the classes. This should be cause for celebration, but instead I'm sitting here typing this long-ass post and dreading going back to social media because he sent me ANOTHER text today which I also haven't opened.

I am his first girlfriend in his life, so I think that's why he's being so clingy even though I expressly told him about my fear of people and reluctance to hang out. He has a really bad case of 'first high-school boyfriend' syndrome, which means that he texts me weird sappy things that just come across to me as empty words, gives me gifts because he thinks for some reason that that's the only thing keeping me around, keeps trying these romance movie 'grand gestures' (I'm pretty sure his mom is talking him into those), and he even asked for my ring size recently 'for future reference' (which I did NOT give to him- I'll be damned if I'm going to let him buy me some ring LITERALLY THREE WEEKS INTO OUR RELATIONSHIP, no matter how cheap!) He treats me like some fickle little kid who needs to be complimented and have things done for them and watched like a hawk every second of every day or else I'll throw a fit and leave him.

I miss how he treated me when we were just friends. He was nice and respected boundaries, he wasn't trying to win my affection with gifts, we only saw each other once a week for movie nights, and he wasn't constantly texting me every second of the day, 'just letting me know he's thinking about me' and telling me how much he loves and misses me. It seems like before, we would joke together and laugh about dumb shit like anime and video games and shit, but now it seems like he's filtering himself to make sure that I won't find anything about him that would make me disagree with him or not like him.

It seems like we're the exact opposites personality-wise now, when we used to be so similar when we were friends.

I've really been around the block a few times when it comes to dating, and its made me more casual with the thought of relationships. To me, dating doesn't automatically mean that you want to marry each other, it just means that you like a person and want to see if you would work out together or not. I know my way around- I know you're not supposed to buy them jewelry or anything expensive until it's been a while. You're not supposed to make them meet family or friends on the first date. You shouldn't change yourself or bend over backwards to cater to them. Give them space and don't say sappy things or 'I love you's too soon. I'm past all of the thinking about insecurities like personality and appearance, because if they are disappointed with me for having my hair tied back and PJs on at home, or if they don't like some base trait of my personality, they probably weren't worth a relationship anyways. I've never been one to be super formal and serious about someone I'm dating, so his behavior sorta really blindsided me. I'm also very emotionally repressed and I don't feel very attached yet, so every 'romantic' thing he says and does just comes off as fake to me because he basically barely even knows me.

So, what do I do, Reddit? I don't really want to break up right now, because I feel like it can still be saved, and I don't really want to break his heart by just ghosting him (partly because he has my address, I have learned that he is not scared of showing up unannounced, and I feel like he would blast sad breakup songs from his car and throw pebbles at my window like in a teen romance drama.) I am planning on finally reading his texts and texting him back tomorrow and telling him that my classes are over. I know I should tell him all of this, but I don't know what to say at all since, once again, I am very emotionally repressed and mostly speak through actions. Please tell me what I should say to him!

TL;DR: 
I am majorly afraid of talking with people. My boyfriend is super clingy and showed up at my house uninvited with a bouquet of roses, romance-movie style. He is pressuring our new relationship to be something very serious and he wants to be around me 24/7 which makes me feel extremely trapped and suicidal. I have been ignoring his texts for a month, and tomorrow I am finally going to look at them and try to find a way to break all of this to him as gently as possible. What should I say?

612,llamawannabingbong,[new],3,c6fn4l,4,"I grew up in a household that loves alcohol. It was pretty much normalized to drink daily or get blackout drunk. I never got crazy with it, but once I was of age I would drink about once a week. Over time my drinking increased to a couple times a week, which still wasn't a big deal. I have depression and anxiety and it really helped me let loose after a long day. I brought up my drinking to my therapist and they said it wasn't a problem.

Fast forward to last month and I got a D.U.I. I dealt with a miscarriage, I was weaning off of antidepressants, and I just needed to get away from home. My boyfriend was annoying the hell out of me. So I drove to a parking lot near our house and got pulled over. This incident made me realize every bad thing that happened in my life (apparently I can't mention the instances here or I will be directed to other subreddits for help) which all happened when I was intoxicated. Nothing good ever came from alcohol.

So I decided to set rules for my drinking. Thing is, I couldn't follow any of these rules once I started drinking. Over a week ago I got my second D.U.I. I realized okay, I had to cut alcohol out entirely because I can't even follow rules once I start drinking. I get too emotional and I try to escape my surroundings, which leads me to driving away.

This leads to my current issue. My boyfriend is trying to stay sober with me, while at the same time lying about why he isn't drinking. I told him he didn't need to stop drinking just cause I did, and he said I wasn't the reason and he just didn't feel like a beer at the time. Okay.

He hasn't had one drink since I decided to go sober. That's fine, except he is lying about why. I keep asking him about it, telling him he doesn't need to stop drinking for me, and he keeps insisting I am not the reason. He just says he doesn't feel like a beer at the moment. But I know for a fact if I started drinking after he said that, he would drink with me. He does exactly what I do, and that is the part that is driving me insane. He doesn't act as his own person, he just copies whatever I do.

I started taking Kratom to help with my anxiety and depression, and then suddenly he started taking it with me. He has no reason to take it other than for recreation. I'm taking it for my mental health issues. When I don't take it he doesn't, and when I do take it he does. When I used to drink alcohol before going sober, he would drink alcohol but if I didn't drink he didn't drink.

That leads me to today. We were sitting on the couch and my boyfriend said ""man I would love a drink right now."" And I said, ""well my mom left two beers in the fridge from when she visited."" And then he said he threw them away. I got upset with him. I know he threw them away because he thinks he is helping me. He thinks I have no self control and that I need his help, when I fucking don't. I'm doing perfectly fine staying sober and I never had an issue not drinking in the first place. I just did stupid things when drunk. He's acting like I need a babysitter to not drink, and he's acting like this is a huge deal. And what is most infuriating is that he is lying about everything. ""Oh I just threw the beers away just cause"" Yea, he threw them away because of me. I don't fucking want his help with this stuff and I don't need it, but no matter how many times I say that he DOESN'T LISTEN. He acts like I need him for this. Having those beers in the fridge was a test to show that I won't drink beer even when it's in the house. I have no temptations when sober. It's easy to not drink when there is zero alcohol in the house too.

I don't even know what to do about all of this. I don't care if my boyfriend wants to be sober too, but he doesn't want to be sober. He only does what he does because of me, and then lies about it. That is the part I can't handle.

We shared a lot of personal things that we never had before, including the fact that she was secretly interested in me during college. I started realizing I liked her a lot during this time, but we live 300 miles apart so a relationship wasn't really feasible. That being said, it  still was nice to have someone I could be open with and just pass some spare time watching cartoons. 

But just in the last couple weeks, she's suddenly become less active online with me. Despite that, she's been contacting me making plans to get in a voice chat and watch something, like ""yeah let's watch that today! Around like 7 is cool?"", and every time dropping them last second/just not being online when the time came. I thought she was just super busy at first, which is understandable, then as this happened more and more, I thought she just didn't like me anymore for some reason and was avoiding me, which hurt.

Anyways, just today she was talking with me for a bit and said we should watch something tonight, let me know when she'd be online, I told her when I was off work and the plan was set again. She seemed earnestly excited about it, and for once it felt like she was going to make an effort to keep her promise. And then I got home and again she wasn't around. Later she messages me saying ""sorry! Im helping my bf move so can't watch right now"". To he honest, felt a little sad about that, but hey, I had no intentions of trying to make a long distance relationship happen, so fair enough. That explains the part where she wasn't talking with me as much. But to make specific plans with me and drop them over and over again? Why would she do that?

He also hates his job, 

In short he?s trying to figure out how to change his life for the better, because he?s not that happy even though he has a stable job and a place to live, he?s just not happy. He?s been so stressed lately. 

Yesterday he let me know that he?s been high (just weed, nothing else) a lot more lately, because it helps him calm down. 

I?m just wondering (I?m not a habitual smoker) if I should be concerned about the weed use, at all? Or is it really helping him? I know it can be calming.

 He never drives under the influence and although he texts me back slower, he doesn?t drop off the face of the earth. He only smokes at home and I don?t expect him to tell me before he gets high at all, I?m just worried about him.

Please no judgement, I?m concerned about his stress and just not sure if I should be concerned about his new smoking habits too! I haven?t seen him in a while and because he lives apart from me, I?m limited on knowing what?s happening.

616,SharpAuthor,Non-Romantic,9,c6ff0y,3,"The last few days have been pretty bad, so please forgive any rambling.

I have been worried about my son for a while. He is former military, and spent time in Afghanistan five years ago, and a few months in Africa not long after. I?m really not sure what happened there, because he is very closed about it.

Ever since his return and especially after completing his term in the military he has gotten very, very distant. He does not stay in communication much, he barely talks when I can get ahold of him, and he has made some comments that I felt alluded to him being very depressed. Nothing concrete, but certain comments that he does not put much value on his life.

I have been asking him for years to please start seeing a therapist. He refuses. He will always tell me he does not have time, he doesn?t like therapists, whatever else. My son can be very stubborn when he wants to be.

I have finally talked him into visiting home for his sisters graduation, and he seemed to perk up at coming home. I felt that I had an opportunity to help ease him into seeing a therapist while he was home, so I decided to take it.

I knew I would never get him to just go, so I asked him to take a ride with me. I drove him to a nearby VA hospital, and asked him to go inside and ask to speak to someone. He was, very, very angry and initially refused, but I begged him to go and he finally went inside. I know it wasn?t the best idea, but I was truly worried for my son and I felt this was the only way he would get help.

I have no idea what happened inside, but he wound up with a 72-hour hold in the inpatient ward. He gave me a call and told me he wanted nothing to do with me anymore and he hated me for bringing him there.

I spent the night in the parking lot crying over it. I tried to visit him while he was in but he refused to see me. The people at the ward could not tell me much other than that he was very irate, uncooperative, and refused to speak to anyone.

Eventually they apparently let him go after his 72 hours. He came back home just long enough to pack his stuff, tell me he hated me once more, and leave.

I have reached out to his girlfriend where he lives now. We have always gotten along fairly well, and she could at least confirm he made it back okay, and that he is still furious with me and refuses to talk to me.

I never meant for him to be involuntarily held. I just wanted him to get help. I love my son more than anything and this whole situation is breaking my heart. I don?t know how I can speak to him or communicate to him that I never meant for that to happen. I just want to talk to him again.

Is there a proper way to approach him? I can talk to his girlfriend but she seems rather cold with me now, too. I know I made a mistake, but I really thought I was doing what was best.

&#x200B;

Initially when talking about her he only referred to her as a friend until he mentioned she was a ""she"", upon which I half-jokingly asked if she was cute and he said he did find her cute. Furthermore, he bought a switch because she asked him to get one so they could play games together. Around this time they also planned to get ice cream together alone (but another friend ended up tagging along) which also didn't quite sit right to me but everything up to this point I feel can be chalked up to personal insecurity. Recently, he was feeling uncertain of our relationship and while we were talking about it he mentioned that he valued her a lot as a friend because he would be genuinely upset to lose her and the only other person he feels that way about is me. This set off huge alarm bells for me to compare our several year long relationship to his with this girl he's known for a month that he's already weirdly close to. Then today, he mentioned that they've been sharing drinks/ drinking from the same straw which I find really hurtful considering I've expressed to him that I don't feel comfortable with their friendship. 

&#x200B;

I feel like all of these things combined have crossed the bridge from innocent to emotional cheating but he insists that I am being insecure since she's in a relationship and obviously he is as well. However, I feel like he's using my disordered body image against me since he knows I am quite insecure of my body/looks and distrusting of my own perspective. Also, I feel he shows an unwillingness to compromise because he won't even stop sharing a straw with her. So, Reddit, do you think I am being insecure? Or is something weird actually going on here?

I lied to myself making myself believe that the nice things i did was out of love. After coming to terms with what i thought i really felt i broke up with him but now i feel like maybe it was a mistake.  

So we?ve known each other for about two months and we did normal things people do in a relationship we went to the movies we went to a carnival, we spent time with my family. we went over each other?s houses and we just had fun together in general but. And i told myself how could i treat someone so nicely and do all these things with them and not have feelings. So i told myself i had feelings meanwhile my boyfriend had overwhelming feelings for me that were all to real.   

Eventually i realized that i was just caught up in a cycle my own Lies. lying to myself and to my boyfriend I made it seem like I had feelings strong enough to support a relationship.

With that being said i told him I didn?t want to be in a relationship. And that i was too busy avoiding the fact that i did?t have feelings for whatever reason.   

Even after we broke up officially he still continued to treat me basically the same, with overwhelming attention, love and care. And it only reminded me of the absent feelings i had that kept me from being with him the way i hurt him through emotional manipulation. I knew I was doing him wrong. I kept reminding him that me not having ?feelings? for him was not his fault and that he was everything someone could ask for in a partner. Nevertheless he kept interrogating me on why i didn?t have feelings for him but truly i didn?t want to think about why i didn?t have feelings or the fact that couldn?t reciprocate the love that he gave me. I was blind to my own emotions and i avoided, dismissed and ignored him as much as possible after the breakup.   

Eventually he gave up trying to uncover my buried feelings wherever they are if they even do exist and he just left it at i?ll always love you but our time together from here on out wont be special.

621,anchorsa,Relationships,2,c6f4n9,2,"TL;DR: i'm about to get into a relationship with someone and i think we're going to try and do open. i need help figuring out what my ground rules are because i didn't anticipate them to agree to this when i brought it up. share your rules!

hi. a little back story. 

this guy and i have been dating since february. matched on tinder in january, hit it off on our first date and never stopped seeing each other. he's always said he's not ready for a relationship  after being in one for 6 years, but he really cares about me. he's made his caring evident in his actions (sticking around through me being kicked out and moving twice, hospital visits, various health issues), but hasn't committed yet, always citing he's not ready for a relationship. despite the fact that functionally we are in a relationship, and he's fine calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. the commitment is what gets him. 

recently, i told him that i love him. it went well but he hasn't said it back. he's come close a few times and even today he was like ""i probably love you too i'm just figuring myself out i'm just being cautious"" and said he wasn't ready again but we could talk about it in august once his job is over. 

here's why he doesn't want to be in a relationship: he's been in lots of them and he feels like he missed out on a lot. he likes dating, he likes the chase, and possibly getting a blowjob out of it. he said it doesn't really matter to him and that he and i have something special but he likes knowing he has the option to go and do whatever. 

rounding back to our conversation earlier today, i was thinking i could keep trying to wait it out for him to be ready, and i brought up the idea of an open relationship. so long as he's actually my boyfriend, at this, he perked up and said ""you'd do that for me?"" and suddenly his demeanor changed. it's not necessarily that he'd go out and do it but we would both get what we want and i said there would have to be some rules and he seemed fine with that and wanted to know what my rules would be. 

at first i was really excited about this idea but i've been trying to think of my rules and i've been giving myself anxiety over what they should be or if i have too many and then preemptively worrying about who he might be sleeping with once he can. 

here's where i need help. i have too many ideas. everything's swirling around up there because i didn't have time to think about it because i didn't think he'd be open to it. 

i don't think it's a multi-relationship thing for him, if i understand correctly it would be more be night stands. 

what i don't want is: intimacy outside our relationship, i don't want him sleeping over elsewhere, i don't want other girls at his apartment, i'd like him to just stick to blowjobs, and i don't want him really cultivating other relationships. i do want to know details. i guess i'd also like to be exclusive for maybe a month before i open it up so that i can actually enjoy my new finally relationship. i guess what i want is ""monogamish"" i.e. it's okay to hook up with others but not emotionally invest in them?

i don't know what his rules would be, but he did mention something about possibly being weirded out about me seeing other guys so if i did see anyone else, it would likely be other women. which is fine with me. 

so what are some of your open relationship rules? give me some ideas. help me throw the metaphorical spaghetti at the wall so i can figure out my thoughts.

622,Throwawaymymarriage0,[new],9,c6f3t6,4,"My wife and I have been married for a long time and didn?t have kids for quite a while. We had one huge fight where we almost got divorced in year two of our marriage and during the fight she told me she had slept with someone while we were exclusively dating but before we were engaged. This really hurt but I decided it had happened about 5 years prior and forgave her for it after a lot of thinking.  

After this things were pretty good for a long time, our sex life wasn?t great but was something I though I could live with. I tried to improve it but nothing would change. In retrospect I realize my self confidence with women was too low and I should have stood up for myself more. I was worried that if I lost her I wouldn?t be able to find someone else. 

After we had our first kid our love increased a lot and we had a lot more and better sex and I was really having high hopes for the rest of our marriage. Then we had our second kid and everything completely changed. The second she got the positive pregnancy test she completely pulled away from me and our intimacy was completely gone for almost two total years. I tried to bring it up but she wouldn?t even talk about it. I was trying to be a supportive husband and not bother her while she was pregnant but after 4 months after the youngest was born I wanted to start to reconnect again. 

After 14 months after our youngest was born I started getting very upset and got really mad at her. I didn?t want to live that life anymore. She was upset that I waited until it built up so much but she didn?t want to talk about it before either. 

Over then next four years this has been going on where she says she is working on things but we still only have sex 6-8 times per year. Sometimes she mentions that we don?t go on enough dates and I?m not wooing her enough. However it?s very expensive for us to get a babysitter and she sometimes says the same thing when I mention dates. I also am affectionate and compliment her a lot but she very rarely gives affection to me and she almost never gives me complements. I felt pretty miserable many days when I didn?t feel loved in my marriage. 

A few months ago I starting acting like an asshole, I was frustrated with the way things were going and didn?t know what to do. I am ashamed for acting like this but I can?t change it now. She called me out on it and we both shared our feelings about it and I decided to make a lot of personal changes and be a better person overall. I wasn?t overweight but now I?ve made a big effort to work out, cook better meals and in general be a more positive person. Things started to get better and I thought we were fine. The a couple months later we wanted to have sex but I had erectile disfunction issues and she really clammed up on me that night and after that, I offered to help her get off but she didn?t want that. We had sex once since then but she didn?t really seem to be there mentally. 

A week after that things got worse and we had another huge fight. She said that she didn?t know if she wanted to stay together and I told her that we needed to fix our sex life if I was going to stay. She mentioned that it?s hard for her to get excited if she doesn?t know it?s going to happen and that really hurt my feelings and still bothers me.  I said I will try to be the best husband I can if she will do the same. I don?t want to half ass our marriage anymore and want it to be a place where we both can be happy. This was a week ago and she said she is trying to mentally get there and hopes we can make it work. I still have my doubts, I?m trying to stay fully engaged but find myself thinking about dating other people now. I never would cheat on her but I feel the need to start preparing for the marriage ending. 

I still really love her and in general she is a great person. She is smart with a good career, she is beautiful and overall a great person. I still don?t know if she loves me though and if she does she hasn?t been able to show it in a way that makes me feel loved in a long time. I?m now sitting here hoping that she does decide to stay together but then worried that things will be the same. I?m going to try my hardest to make things work but I think this is my last time. I am a lot more confident now and not afraid to leave if things don?t work but there wouldn?t be that much that would have to change to make it a great marriage I?m just not sure that we will get there. I?m also not looking forward to the dating landscape at my age even though I feel I would be desirable but I haven?t talked to other women in that manner in 20 years. 

I don?t want to only see my kids half the time but I refuse to be unhappy anymore.

TL:DR my wife and I may get divorced. Things in general had been good but our lack of intimacy makes me feel unloved and very unhappy.

Two months ago, I (F25) broke up with my boyfriend (M23). We had dated for about a year and a half and things were pretty good. We really thought we were going to get married and start a family.

However, I had a huge bomb dropped on me. Two months ago, a woman messaged me on Facebook to tell me she had just had his child three months prior. The conception occurred when I was away for an internship, so we were in a long distance relationship. During that time, he ghosted me for about a week. I ended things at the time because I thought he was cheating, but then after some time apart I decided to give it another try. After all I didn?t have any proof he was cheating (so I told myself lol).

The next 6 months of our relationship were great and I really fell hard in love with him. However near the end somethings really started to bother me. He?s REALLY selfish in bed. Like we had to buy lube because he was just never ?in the mood? to perform any type of sexual acts on me except for actual sex, while I was constantly giving him plenty of attention in that area. He was also pressuring me to have a threesome with him and another girl because he had trouble practicing monogamy. Yeah I didn?t want to lol.

He also had really strong views on gender roles that were rather messed up and that started to become really hard. He would constantly ask me to get up and get him things while he stayed on the couch (water, some food, a phone charger, literally everything). It got to the point where I would get up 5-6 times just to get his stuff. It really really started to bother me at the end of our relationship.

However, after all this crap, I still miss him guys. Really terribly. He got deployed right after we broke up (I know the timing was terrible for the break up, but I couldn?t handle the cheating/baby thing). And I?m still worried about him and think about him all the time. This post was sort of a rant about all the negatives in our relationship, but there were really really great things about him that I loved. trust me I wouldn?t have stayed for as long as I did if there wasn?t something good here. I just miss it all.

The other night we got into a massive fight, I was very upset that he was being selfish towards me in other ways, and then we made up and he told me everything was fine and wanted to comfort me. He asked for sex and I said having sex would make me feel worse in that moment and so he was like ok, that?s off the table no worries. But then asked if we could cuddle naked and basically started dry humping me until I let him fuck me but I was literally crying while he did, even though I did say it was ok once he was about to put it in me. 

Then he bailed on a trip he promised me, and I got really upset again bc he had pretended everything was fine when it wasn?t, and I told him I would tell his partner about the unprotected sex bc I wasn?t blinded by my feelings for him any more, and he flipped out and is begging me not to tell her because it would end their relationship.

628,AllThePrettyWhorses,[new],9,c6er2c,3,"I left my ex almost two years ago for cheating, very long story short, he was carrying on sexual relationships behind my back. Kicked him out, haven't regretted it for a moment. Onward and upward.

He started dating someone last year. I am in no way at all involved or invested in their relationship, but she seems really nice, really well put together. I question why she's with someone like him but whatever. We have two kids together and she treats them very kindly from what I hear, and from what I can tell shes doing things for them he wouldn't, like buy them toys and clothes and stuff. She seems responsible and caring, and I have zero problem with my kids spending time with or bonding with her.

Ok so here is where the shitty thing happens... For some reason one of his accounts name and passwords were saved into my computer from way back when we were together. Curiosity got the better of me...I honestly didn't think it would work because how could you not change your pw? But it did. It logged me in and i immediately saw messages from him propositioning someone (20f) for sex. They are relatively recent, certainly long after they started dating ""seriously"" (his words).

I feel like a shitbag because I know this thing and I feel like I can't tell her. I've told a couple People that I trust, and they all say the same thing, DON'T TELL HER. I don't know how she'll react, and I know for a fact he has lied about me to make it seem like I'm worse than i am, or downplay the fact that he cheated on me etc. I don't even know if she knows why we broke up. I have had almost no contact with her. The consensus is, if I tell her... It will prob blow up in my face, especially since we are still in a custody dispute, it could become ugly.

But it's hurting my heart so bad because I've been her. I've been exactly in her spot and I wish someone had told me. I wish someone had said he was feeding me lie after lie. What if they move in together? What if my kids start to love her, And then it all goes bad? They don't need any more instability. And she seems so nice.

And if I tell her I also come off immediately as the stalking, crazy ex, hacking his account and stuff. I feel like a total asshole doing it in the first place, it's really not my business, but it was just there; literally one impulsive Click and I was logged in .

Tldr; I know my ex is lying to his current gf. I have proof he is at least lying if not cheating. Ive been told to leave it alone but I am still torn... But confessing what i know could really backfire.

My mom went through a really rough time when I was in high school. She got divorced, hospitalized multiple times, both brothers died, I went to live with my dad, etc. She had a lot of lawyer bills, medical bills, child support, my dad apparently really screwed her over and filed for bankruptcy without taking off her name. She still has a large amount of debt. 

When I was in college, the first two years I lived at home and after that I had a cheap apartment with roommates in another state. I went to college on a VA loan so tuition should have been payed for and I received living expenses but I don?t remember how much it was. She bought me a car that was 10k, paid for my cell phone bill, health insurance,  car insurance, I never had to worry about money and didn?t work through college. I thought the VA loan was pretty much covering everything, but now she says it was like 500 a month that wasn?t? I did one semester of summer school to get ahead and we took out a loan for 10k, which looking back seems high but that?s what my mom said we needed and I just believed her. 

I am forever grateful that I grew up never having to worry about money. It really was a blessing and I have a great GPA because I could focus on school. I was finally able to get a credit report after it kept failing to verify my identity....She actually took out 25k in student loans in my name to fund this carefree lifestyle I had (well it?s 25k now after making payments for 5 years). There are also a couple credit cards totaling 10k. We also had a big debacle a couple years ago where she got a 70k loan from her boss to consolidate her debt. To hide this from my stepdad, she put the money in my account and paid off some bills gradually over a year. She was not keeping track correctly and ended up taking 18k of my money in doing so. 

When I first brought up the extra loans/cards she was immediately apologetic and asked if I could ever forgive her. She has been making payments every month on time, but my debt to income ratio is pretty high and affects me being able to get a car loan or house. However, now she keeps getting defensive whenever we talk about it and just brings up how much money she has spent on me. 10k for my car, 13k for health insurance and 7k for car insurance over the years, all the money in child support that she gave my dad while he didn?t even work and how he owes me that money, she?s very bitter about how much money she gave him and how she still had to buy me school clothes and whatnot because he wouldn?t. 


I have a flexible job and they agreed for me to work remote for a month so I could go home and help look over all the finances and see exactly how deep this all goes. I feel like she has lost her privilege to handle this herself and I need to be involved/in control. I would really like to not report this and potentially get her in trouble for felony fraud, especially because she has been paying it. I am torn at being super upset over this because she has paid for a lot over the years and a lot of parents do not take on debt to support their kid through college. Obviously, if she couldn?t afford it she should?ve told me and made me get a job before just taking loans in my name, but I can see where she was trying to save me that headache and how she couldn?t just tell me ?figure it out?. If I knew we were going into debt then I could?ve budgeted better, or maybe the money didn?t even go to me and was just being used to help keep her afloat and she?s using it as an excuse (that I feel she has convinced herself of). 

I told her that we need to handle this as a team or I am going to report it and she responded that it?s not like she?s a deadbeat who hasn?t been paying it. And all the other things she?s paid for. She says she has a spreadsheet and is taking care of and there?s nothing left that I can do. That she doesn?t want me up there getting pissed because she bought a pack of gum. 

I?m pretty sure I know she?s wrong, and she can?t guilt me about money she chose to spend as a parent, but how do I even approach this? She DID go above her duties by paying for anything the VA didn?t cover until I was about 22, and I don?t want to be ungrateful after all she?s paid for (or I paid for? Idk) when she didn?t have to.

My sister has always made choices that make her life more difficult, because she feels having a hard and shitty life makes her better than people that have it ""easy"". She doesn't understand that people often work extremely hard to live that way. Specifically my brother and I, who she hates. Unfortunately, for this reason, and others, we think she'll become homeless within the year. Our family has gotten to the point that giving her money just enables her to demand more of it without ever taking responsibility for herself or her family. Our parents are in debt because of it.

She has 3 amazing daughters (5, 6, and 10). She openly verbally and emotionally abuses the eldest, and can barely show affection to the other two. She's told our mother that she ""doesn't get anything out of them"" anymore, which breaks all of our hearts because those girls deserve better. She recently split up with the father of the youngest two, and has moved back in with my parents temporarily. My parents adore her children, but my sister is tearing everyone's lives apart in that house.

1. She's got a new boyfriend that CPS says can't be near her kids (we don't know why but it's not a stretch to guess), and she has made him the priority. She doesn't even spend the night in the house with her children, opting to spend it with him instead.
2. Our dad is not well. He's recovering from a cancer scare, and has early/slowly progressing Alzheimer's. He's confided in my mother that he feels like he's having a breakdown from the stress of having her in the house, and the stress of taking care of three small children. He absolutely loves them, but his condition is such that he is often confused and temperamental, which isn't conducive to raising three kids all over again.
3. There's built up resentment. Not at all toward the children, but to my sister who starts screaming matches every chance she gets. Over the years she has maintained that every problem in her life is our parents' fault. Now she screams it in their faces every night, and never thanks them for taking her in or taking care of her kids. I live in constant fear that one of these fights will end in my father having a stroke or heart attack or my mother having a breakdown herself.
4. My mother has confided in me that due to my father's health, if the girls are taken away from my sister, my parents cannot take all three of them. Their fathers (the oldest has another father) are all losers, but the youngest two would probably go to live with their dad. If he doesn't want them, they would have to go into foster care. My mom thinks they could take the oldest, but fears for my dad's health constantly. Needless to say, the guilt is killing them both.

&#x200B;

My dilemma is this. I have worked tooth and nail to get where I am today. I am in the second year of an extremely competitive career in a city 2 hours away from the family. I have overcome deep, suicidal depression to get here. I am paying off student debt for a hard-earned college diploma to get here. I have finally gotten to a point where my life is how I've wanted it to be for the past 12 years. Before things got to this point with my sister, I was actually happy.

&#x200B;

If the kids have nowhere else to go, I love them dearly but don't think I could take them. There aren't jobs for the work I do in my home town which often requires long days and weekend work. And where I live now, I can't afford an apartment for 2-3 extra people; let alone the cost of taking care of them.

Which sounds crazy to say because it was sooo soon, but we clicked immediately, and I felt absolutely crazy about her, like everything was feeling absolutely so right and she reassured me she definitely felt the same. 

Fast forward to now, and I catch her contradicting herself on something she had said previously. So the two weeks leading up to us deciding we wanted to be a couple things were going perfect. We seriously couldn?t get enough of each other, and she was saying how much she liked me, was already talking about wanting to introduce me to her family and friends, etc. She also said she wasn?t seeing anyone else. Butt of course there?s a kicker, so it turns out she actually was seeing someone leading up to us being official. I know we weren?t technically a couple yet, but it still just feels awful that she was sleeping with someone else whilst seeing me, and saying how much she liked me etc. at the same time.

So when I heard her contradict herself I called her out on it, and she got pretty defensive about it. She said she didn?t owe me anything, and that she hadn?t known me long, and that she didn?t know that things were going somewhere. Of course I obviously thought things would because of the shit she was saying to me and I feel like she had to have known that they would because of how quickly things were moving. 

I really do care a lot for her, so I?ve been trying to get over it cause I mean sure, she?s right, we weren?t together yet. However, I don?t feel like I?m getting the whole truth. She swears she ended things with him before we even started dating officiallly, but I can?t shake the feeling I?m being lied to. It turns out that the guy she was seeing is one of her ?friends? and that she was hanging out with him at least up until a week ago, but says that nothing else happened with them. Which seems strange to keep hanging out with someone you were only ?hooking up with? after we were official. 

I don?t know if I?m being jealous or if I?m justified for being all fucked up about this. I just feel like her sleeping with someone else while saying those types of things to me was a really shitty thing to do.

I met her 9 months after me and my ex gf of 3 years split up. My ex was honestly a real POS. Constantly lying and manipulating me, gaslighting me, cheating, and the whole nine yards.. I had told her about my ex, so when things first blew up she kept saying that I was only acting the way I am because of what happened in my previous relationship. I thought maybe she was right so I tried to put it behind us.

So naturally I?m feeling really uneasy about my new relationship because of the new revelation. I have this same feeling I had with my ex like that maybe I?m being manipulated and lied to all over again. 

I broached the subject about it with her again a few days later and asked if she had been honest with me. She got what seemed like kind of mad, and said she didn?t know how else to reassure me or what to say about it. Then she kind of flipped things on me by saying that I keep doubting her, and it seems like I?m just looking for a way out. Even said that she?s not perfect and that if that?s what I want I should go find it . 

I seriously am crazy about her and am looking for anyone reason to stay. But I feel like I?m losing my goddamn mind. This is exactly how the beginning of my last relationship started. I?m absolutely miserable and I don?t know what to do. Any advice is very much appreciated.

As stated, we're both 26, live together (have for a year) and been dating for ~3 yrs. while we both enjoy video games, he's much more into them than am.

I guess normally I don't mind. He makes time for me, even if it's not as much as I'd like. We eat dinner together, we'll watch a bit of tv together, we do things on saturdays. Over all, he's a good boyfriend, a good partner. Sometimes, though, he'll go through these ""phases"" where he literally just ignores me (or worse, gets annoyed at me) in favor of playing video games with his friends.

Oddly enough, I don't think I'd be as annoyed if he was EITHER playing games OR hanging out (in person) with his friends, but for some reason the fact that he'd rather play Apex Legends with his buddies than spend time with me is.... well, sometimes it's just annoying, sometimes it's downright hurtful and I'm not entirely sure why.

I'm not sure what I want done about this. It's how he enjoys his free time, that's fine. I don't want him to stop gaming or anything. But the fact that he either plays games to ""have him time"" or to hang out with his friends is annoying. 

Is this a normal thing? Does anyone else's SO do something of the like? Is it dumb for me to prefer that he go hang out with them irl (his one friend lives five minutes away) than just ignore me while I'm 3 ft away, blocking out the world with his headphones?

Also, we rarely go to bed together anymore. I get up early for work, and he stays up late playing games. We also seldom get to wake up together, either. It's also frustrating, because on days that we may have the OPTION of going to bed together, he will instead opt to stay up until 2am on his computer.

641,Yellow_Brick_Road,Non-Romantic,41,c6drei,93,"My mother has been a chronic alcoholic since I was about 10 years old. She went to countless rehabs over the years but she would start drinking almost immediately after coming home.  She was emotionally and verbally abusive for years. She would tell me that she wished I was never born and I was the reason for her drinking.   


About 3 years ago I completely blocked her and my father.  I saw her for the first time since I went no contact last month at my Grandma's (her mother's) funeral. She looked terrible. Eyes sunken in, leathery skin, stick thin, no teeth, and walked hunched over barely able to carry her own weight. One of my cousins made a comment saying she looked worse than my Grandma and *she's dead*.   


My brother (who still contacts her) has been telling me for months that he doesn't think she mas much time left. He mentioned that all she does is drink and sleep and stopped eating months ago. So this isn't a surprise to me. I was more just waiting for the inevitable to happen.   


I literally got the call about 20 minutes ago. I don't feel much emotion about it... I'm not sad. Kind of angry that this was the life she chose and I wish I had a healthy loving mother growing up. However, I'm mostly stressed out. I don't know if I even want to go see her on her death bed. I have so many questions running through my mind.   


If I don't see her will my aunts, uncles, cousins think I'm a terrible person? Will I regret not seeing her alive one last time? Will my father kick me out or not let me see her since I've blocked them? I don't even know what I would say to her.   


Should I even go to the funeral? Will it be weird if I don't see her in the hospital but go to the funeral? What about the fact that some people might expect me to speak at the funeral since I'm her daughter? I don't have anything nice to say so I don't want to say anything. If I don't cry at her funeral will I be seen as a monster?   


TL;DR: My mother was an abusive alcoholic most of my life. I cut her out of my life 3 years ago. She's now in the hospital dying and I have no idea how to feel about anything.

Edit: My husband has convinced me to visit her and I?ll be making the drive to my hometown with him today. I?ve decided to visit her only for selfish reasons. 

So I can not have any regrets in the future. If she turns me away that?ll be her choice and at least I?ll know I tried. I still feel like I don?t know what I?ll say to her and honestly I don?t think I?m going to say much. I just want to see her condition with my own eyes. 

I don?t think I?ll be able to forgive her. However I do feel a weird kind of peace knowing this will end her suffering.

I just wanted to see if I?m overreacting about this situation. So my fianc? and I are getting married in a little over a month, we had a 6 month engagement and the final details have all been set. We plan on having a small wedding with just some close friends and family no more then 50 people. I?m really upset with my fianc? right now.

About a week ago an ex-friend that we had previously removed from our life contacted my fianc? about wanting to catch up. She had previously been my roommate and to put it gently we didn?t end on good terms. She was toxic and bullied one of our other (random) roommates into attempting suicide. I wasn?t there for this fight with our other roommate but one of my best friends (also a roommate) has told me that this ex friend crossed many lines. Damaging property in the house and eventually my best friend decided to pack her things and return home for the holidays because of the situation. She then got mad at me when I pointed out her toxic behavior. Going on to complain and call me a ?bitch? who took a ?suicidal cunts? side instead of hers to my fianc? (then boyfriend). My fianc? at the time said he would never speak to her again after kicking her out of his apartment. 

My fianc? though decided to invite her to our wedding even though I told him specifically not to. That I did not want this toxic person at our wedding, bringing up past experiences that did not happen that long ago. I do not want her to be there on what is supposed to be the beginning of our marriage and I told him to un-invite her. He refused, saying he already did it and can?t undo it. My bridesmaids agree that it?s ridiculous that he invited her despite all that has happened and despite me telling him explicitly not to last minute invite her as we had wanted to keep the gathering small and in good company.

 My fiance [25]  has ADHD& Bipolar.  It's a 2  month wait to get an apt to get adhd meds but he is already on mood stabilizers.

I cannot just deal with it or ignore it anymore  if anyone has any advice that can help him and I let me know. I have also had countless of talks with him  and it gets me nowhere because he cannot help it. 


Also edit: he was like this before mood stabilizers and doesnt drink or do drugs 

Driving:

 When driving there is a delay in his reaction. If the light turns green it's at least another 7-8 seconds before his brain registers to go. 

When driving he is in his lane but he swerves in his lane he cant keep the car straight to save his life. He looks drunk 

 (Now there are many other driving concerns but I am trying to keep it short and simple) 

Coordination:

He trips, falls and drops 80% of things he touches 

I mean it is severe and from a distance watching him navigate through a store you would think he has severe special needs. 
He walks with no purpose and a pick pocketer could smell him from a mile away. 




How do I help him with a faster reaction time? If it's a shooting game he will win every fast pace round so I don't understand.

In April my best guy friend had asked to be roommates. He asked because him and I both have our own apartments but he has a daughter and he?s hard on times. So i said no initially because even though we?re friends we aren?t BEST friends. So a few weeks later he asked again so this time i said ?I?ll think about being roommates, give me time to change jobs in May and see how much my checks would be?.




So he says his new lease starts in July. So i let him know initially in May that because I?m not getting a steady set of hours that we couldn?t move in together. Instead of talking about alternative ways to be roommates he got upset. He started bashing me and telling me that i put him in a financial bind. And i said how are you in a bind when we haven?t moved and a lease hasn?t been signed. Then he said ?you shouldn?t have left your other job i told you!?
Two days After he asked could he borrow money so because i felt bad for not being able to get the new apartment with him. I gave him $250 to help him out with his rent for his current apartment. After cashapping him the $250 my friend ghosted me.
Fast forward to this Sunday. my boyfriend calls me and says ?your friend that you told me you have money to, why is he calling me telling me you have been popping up over his house and blowing up his phone?? And i said ?i haven?t even talked to him in almost 4 weeks!? I have never came over unannounced

I?ve been feeling a little bummed because I am always honest with my boyfriend so for him to say he doesn?t know who to believe actually broke my heart. I don?t talk or speak badly on my boyfriend.

We  met online at first a little over a month ago. Since then we've gone to  dinner, introduced each other to friend groups, had drinks, had sex a  few times, spent night over and cuddled, and gotten to know each other.  Neither of us have specifically talked about if we're dating or just  exploring or what's going on. Suggestions on how to approach this topic  without coming on too forceful would be great.

I  am open to dating him, slowly progressing, and if things go well have a  monogamous relationship. My worry is that my most recent relationship  (4 years ago) wasn't very healthy because I rushed into it, and even  though I've gotten a lot better and feel less of the craziness from it, I  don't want to end up in that sort of situation again or take out my  insecurities from it on him. But I don't think I'm ready to open up to  him yet about this ex because I'm worried it'll be too much this early  on.

Thoughts  on how to go about showing my interest in him while also wanting to  take it slow? I've never had this type of conversation with a guy that  I'm curious to pursue these feelings with. I don't want to be too  forceful or pressure him and I'm anxious he'll reject me, but I also  don't want this to go on and lead to more hurt feelings and problems  later.

He is not an affectionate or expressive guy. He can quite easily go a day without checking in to see how I am. He would never reach out to hold my hand or say nice things that affirm our relationship. 

His way of expressing his commitment to me definitely revolves around acts of service and quality time. He invites me over and cooks a nice dinner, he'll take my bins out, he'll open the car door for me, he'll walk on the road side if we're out and about etc. 

I am totally head over heels for him. We have met each others families and friends and he is so wonderful with them. Everyone that meets him/knows him can only shower this guy in compliments, and I get it. He is a beautiful guy.

However, I can't help but feel the things he does for me are just friendly and polite things to do.

I would love for him to say something nice every once in a while that affirms we are heading in the right direction. I am often left feeling a bit depleted and unsure of where his head is at - like wondering if he is bored with the relationship or losing interest.

652,,[new],8,c6dajj,0,"I (23F) have been involved in a relationship with B (40M) for nearly a year, mostly all long distance. I am an American professional athlete competing/training abroad for much of the year and he is a European coach in the same sport. We met at a professional event in one foreign country last summer and hit it off. I have never found someone quite like him... he had a sparkle in his eye and a passion and drive that matched my own. We both had the same fire to make ourselves better in our sport. I knew I needed him on my team and that he was one of the most knowledgeable people I had met about our sport. At some of the dinners during the event, we talked for hours and hours about history, philosophy, etc. I was amazed by his depth of knowledge about the whole world. Oftentimes, athletically minded folks can be a bit ignorant of other things. Everything was platonic at this point.  


At the end of the event, I expressed that I was glad to meet him, hoping to establish a continuing friendship. He jokingly invited me back to his home country for a week- there was a high level tournament that weekend in his hometown. I asked him if he meant it. He said he had no idea that I would even dream of coming, but he would be delighted to have me. He even paid for my Airbnb (since I was at the beginning of my career and broke, while he was financially more established.) I agreed.   


Of course, running away to a foreign country with a man you just met as a young woman is super dangerous, but I read the situation well and decided that IF he was going to try the put the moves on me, then I would be okay with that. I thought it was glamorous, like something from a movie. College girls have flings all the time, but who else would have a fling with a dashing European man who would show you all the sights of his home country?  


We met in his country and I was knocked head over heels. Dinner by a castle, talking late into the night. I clearly knew he had intentions in the back of his head, but he was nothing but proper. By the third day, I decided to kiss him and the rest is a little NSFW.  


Now, here's the first red flag. The morning after we were together, he tells me that he loves me. Like **loves** me. I stammer and tell him that I can't say it back to him. After all, we've known each other for a week. He continues to treat me like a princess and I have a beautiful week in his country. I go home.

  
When I'm home, we video call twice a day and I'm endlessly excited to talk to him. We discuss philosophy and our sport and I am convinced that with his help, I'll be a star. Plus, he loves me to the moon and back. He flies over from Europe to visit me and we spend a week in a major US city, viewing art, eating dinner at lovely restaurants and doing beautiful vacation things.  


At this point, I am aware that this isn't **real**. We are two people that have great chemistry, but in the end, we only go on vacations together. He on the other hand, plans to grow old with me. At first these declarations of love were sweet and made my heart flutter, but after awhile, I began to feel the burden of them. How could he know? We don't live together full time, we live on separate continents. We would continue to live on separate continents as long as I played my sport professionally.  


Meanwhile, I am getting increasingly frustrated and anxious about my sport. I am not performing as well as I would like and I am worried about my ability to sign a contract when I turned pro. He and I pour over video from my practices. He's basically functioning as my consultant coach. He has negative things to say about my teammates and me. Obviously, I'm going to him for coaching, so he's going to have stuff to say, but slowly it builds and builds. I'm reclusive and spend all of my free time talking to him. Eventually, I finish the season but I don't feel great about it. He wants to see me, so 24 hrs after my final college match, he has me on a direct flight to come and see him.   


I feel glamorous again, we spend another week exploring another major destination city and my fears are covered up. I know in my heart that I can't spend my life with him. One night, I casually mention a dream I had... about a daughter we might have in the future. He is repulsed by the idea and doesn't want kids. That's a huge problem, because I see my future as a mother very clearly. I don't push the issue so as not to ruin our vacation.  


I return home, pack my bags and move to another foreign country for four months to play my rookie season. Again, its not going as well as it should be and I lean on him for support. Eventually, he starts crafting the narrative that I **need** him to be great. He's taking a job on a crappy team in a crappy league. I ask myself, if he's such a brilliant coach, why is he unable to get a better job? Eventually, he starts telling me that I will come play for him. We will live together and he ""will make a player out of you"". I think its a great idea. I can fix all the things that need fixing, then I can go on to greatness in better leagues, make more money, play for Team USA etc.  


But then, he has another job opportunity that pays way more. I'm **gutted** at the prospect that he might not ""save"" me. Eventually, he does take the job where we would be together. Thankfully, my teammates and another coach saw what happened to me, emotionally and asked what's wrong. They tell me that I don't need anybody else to make myself better, that its just on me, that I can do it.  


I've woken up, briefly, and I think I see what he was trying to do. He sends me a contract for this team, detailing our living situation and everything. He alludes that I may not be able to get another contract, so I'd better sign this one. I freak out, in the depths of anxiety and depression and I break up with him hastily, without explanation.   


After that, I'm a wreck. He was my lifeline in that foreign country, but I play well in my last few matches and make it home. I was even invited to train with Team USA. It seems I didn't need him after all. But it still ate at me, how I broke up with him. For as much as he loved me, I owed him an explanation. I still remembered how he cried on the phone when I ended it.   


I called him back, probably two months after the breakup. He uses his words and I take him back. Someone who loves me this much couldn't have meant to hurt me... it was just my depression and anxiety talking. I had made him into the boogeyman. He was just trying to help and comfort me the only way he knew how.  


But now I'm here, today, in a vastly better place. I am playing well, going to a great team and have an incredibly bright future in front of me. The only problem is, those feelings are back. The feelings that he is arrogant, only seeks to prove his superiority. When I told him that I had earned my place on the national team, he didn't congratulate me, he only said that ""oh that's fantastic! My girlfriend wears the red, white and blue!""  


My achievement only mattered in the context of **him.** This was the second wakeup call.  


So now, I think I have to break up with him for real. I just don't know how to do it that does a service to the man I love, the bright, passionate man who made me his princess and showed me the world. I'm afraid if I speak to him, he'll just manage to explain his way out of the situation, but if I said nothing, then its completely out of the blue. **I truly believe he doesn't know what he's doing. It can't be out of malice, only ignorance.**

Recently, he doesn't seem to be coming out of these cycles as well and what I've done in the past to help is not cutting it anymore. I keep telling him that he needs to help me help him and have suggested seeking therapy again.

&#x200B;

He seems to be in such a horrible state recently that all of these attempts to help are being met with negativity and anger. Every time I try to talk to him about concerns or potential solutions, he believes I'm blaming him for everything thats happening and distances himself from me. He thinks he is truly alone in the world and wants nothing more than to run away somewhere new.

&#x200B;

I'm not the expert at helping someone you love deal with depression. This is where I need some advice I suppose. Does he no longer want my attempts at help? Are the things I'm doing making it worse? Maybe someone who has been in a similar situation, on either side, can offer some insight.

&#x200B;

So I apologize in advance for sucking you into my (17M) teenage drama, it's just that I'm not out of the closet to my parents and don't talk to them about relationship issues since I'm not close to them. So basically, I have no one to talk to about these kinds of things. Currently, I am studying abroad in Spain which I am grateful for. I arrived this past Saturday. I met this guy, let's call him Adam (18M). Adam is eighteen and moving to New England, where I live, for school. Adam and I hit it off instantly. We have similar personalities and can talk for hours. He's one of the kindest people I have ever met. Quite frankly, I have never fallen so hard for someone or been this infatuated, especially someone I have only known for three/four days. Many of our mutual friends told me that he was flirting with me, he's very touchy with me, and he even sent me the heart emojis a few times when we texted. Also, I had to go to the hospital a few days ago for food poisoning and he was talking about sending me a ""get-well"" package and was incredibly worried.

Today, I texted him asking if he was gay/bi. I assumed that he was and I wanted to ask him out. I was crushed when he replied saying he was straight. I understand that he can't change that and I am not trying to shame him for that by any means. I feel so crushed because it has been over five years since I've felt such strong feelings for someone and I feel a bit lead-on by him which makes me feel hurt. I'm having this tendency to blame myself for what happened. I feel depressed beyond repair. It's been so difficult for me to hide my melancholy feelings and pretend to be happy when we hang out and I have to put on an act which is killing me to the point where I just want to avoid everyone.

How do I deal with this? Are my feelings justified or am I being immature and should suck it up?

657,friend_help_,[new],7,c6cw97,2,"Hello, I wanted some advice for how to best address this situation. 

Some background, I had a housewarming party about a week ago where I invited a lot of my friends as well as my younger brother. He?s my best friend and he just moved into my city so he came and helped set up before the party. My friend also came a little early before the party started, and so it was a few of us hanging out before more people showed up. 

Immediately I knew she was flirting with him, it was fairly obvious. And I love my friend, I do, but she does not know how to flirt well. It is very ?high school.? She was giggling, flipping her hair, and talking about how he must be ?so strong? because he was in the military. I was mortified for her and him, and I had no idea what to do. I ended up greeting more people who showed up, but I silently checked with my bro that he was ok, he gave me that head nod that everything was fine. 

I came back and he was then outside by the grill and my friend was in the living room sitting by herself, I checked in with her a few times but she said she was fine and I wasn?t going to force it and I got swept up in other conversations/hosting stuff. 

Anyways, my bro came over for dinner recently and we were just talking and he mentioned that she asked for his number. He gave it to her, and apparently she?s been texting him nonstop trying to be flirty, or asking him how his day is going, what he?s doing, plans/dates they could do, all that kind of stuff. And he also explicitly told her he wasn?t interested in her romantically after she asked him if we wanted to go to dinner. She keeps texting him and being flirty, almost acting like him rejecting her didn?t happen, and so now he?s just ignoring her texts. 

I feel awful about this, my bro has already told her he?s not interested. She?s also really naive to dating and what men are like, she?s created an image of her perfect guy and she?s never dated so I think that?s contributing to her fixating on my brother? I don?t know, I feel terrible analyzing it like this, but I?m trying to figure out why she?s behaving like this when normally she?s exceptionally shy and awkward around men and now she?s texting him about how her and my bro should go away for a weekend (???). 

It?s super weird to say the least, but now I guess my questions are how do I go about addressing this with her? My bro kind of asked me to, he had said maybe me saying something would get her to understand he isn?t interested. I don?t want to embarrass her or hurt her feelings, but I don?t want my brother to be uncomfortable by her interactions. And I also understand if it was a man doing this to a woman it would have been dealt with immediately and it would be creepy/stalkerish as hell. How should I talk to her about how she?s acting and how my brother has told her he isn?t interested? 

Thanks in advance for any advice

Over the time L became like somewhat an protective older sister towards C. For L I was more like a very good friend... but C, it was pretty clear for L and me she liked me more then just a best friend. C and I are literally soulmates, She is the most adorable Girl I have ever met, she?s someone I just want to protect at all cost, she is so innocent (tho she says it isn?t true trying to prove me wrong but just proofing my point) for years I tried to force myself to look at her more like a litte sister. 

But about 1 1/2 years ago she literally confessed to me that she loves me but I probably see her just as a friend and this may make it awkward between us but she just had to get it off her heart... so I just let all my feelings out too, that everything I said every compliment wasn?t just me being nice or me trying to make her feel better, that everything I said was my honest views. Literally trying to hold in my tears while I poured out my heart, as C was crying of joy and surprise. (L literally having her own party because she was waiting for this to happen for forever) 

... tho there?s the problems... she is a Muslim living in a very Muslim (tho not as extreme Religious) family, (wich I personally haven?t really a problem with) but I am a Swiss grown up as a Evangelical-Protestant Christian (tho my beliefs are more Apatheistic aka I don?t really care if there?s a god or not) wich is 5 years older then her. Her parents are very protective of her and even after they found out that I am male (tho To extreme i can understand why) and not Muslim, forced her to break up every contact with me (which she did for 3 days until she made her parents believe she actually did it) her Twin sister, friends and Cousins literally are 100% ok whit me. 
Knowing they will never accept it we are still just friends. (Just being overly cutesy whit each other) 

{and to take away the worries some might have gotten, no there?s nothing sexual or something like that going on in the slightest due to her being to innocent to even actually consider that and me being well aware that she is still underaged and me not being the type of guy who is interested in such kind of things}

TL;DR :
I know she actually suffers from this situation but she would get even more hurt if I stopped talking to her. Still... i will do anything to keep her happy and I would do anything to be at her side... tho I don?t want her to get problems with her family, because I know they are good parents and she loves them very much.

660,kitchenlessCastle,[new],1,c6cw01,2," **Tl;dr**: my grandma accused my mum of stealing money (she didn?t), and now they?re not talking. My grandpa has broken his hip and will need my mum?s support to be able to stay at home with grandma. I am planning on going to their house to set the record straight and tell grandma she has to let my mum back in so she can support grandpa.

&#x200B;

Some background on my grandparents: they are quite old and frail and have been for most of my life. She has rheumatoid arthritis and is frequently in a lot of pain, and he has dementia (he?s otherwise quite independent and looks after my grandma fairly well). I?ve never been really close to them, but my mum has always had a good relationship with her parents (at least as an adult ? they had a much less positive relationship when she was young).

&#x200B;

Ever since my great aunt (grandma?s sister) died a few years ago, my mum has been giving her parents some support with financial stuff (they are decently affluent, but got into a situation where they weren?t paying their rent and nearly lost their house. Basically, they have money, but no idea about paying bills and dealing with the housing department). In return my grandma has occasionally helped mum out with money (we have always been pretty poor. On the rare occasion she?s given us money it has gone to bills and car repairs). Most recently (either late last year or early this year), she gave my mum a cheque for $900.

&#x200B;

From way back in January this year, grandma has started to become almost as forgetful as grandpa, as well as vindictive and nasty. She basically bullies grandpa (e.g. blaming him for the incident where they weren?t paying their rent, although it wasn?t his fault) and says a lot of nasty things about family members behind their backs.

A few months ago shit really hit the fan when she accused my mum of stealing the $900, which was given to her as a cheque. I can say for certain that mum did not, would not, and could not steal anything from anyone, especially not her parents. I was there when the cheque was given to her. After making the accusation, grandma called my mum a bitch and told her to never come back (this is highly out of character for her and very distressing for my mum).

&#x200B;

Ever since then mum has basically been estranged from her parents, and is very distraught about it. This is made worse by grandma telling other people in the family that mum stole the money, which again is not true. My brother (28M) has more to do with our grandparents than I do, so he?s still visited them in this time. Apparently, he?s tried to bring up the whole issue with grandma to resolve it, but I honestly don?t believe him (he has zero sense of loyalty or integrity and is 100% maintaining his relationship with our grandparents for their money, but that?s a whole other post?).

&#x200B;

That brings us to now. About 2 weeks ago, grandpa had a fall and is now in hospital with either a broken hip or pelvis (the story changes depending on who we ask). My brother was at their house when it happened, and had to call an ambulance (after calling our mum twice to ask for permission???) because grandma wasn?t going to do it.

Mum has visited grandpa and is in contact with his social workers at the hospital. It?s possible he will be able to keep living at home with some additional support, which is good because I don?t think either of them want to go into a home (even though they probably need to be). The only person who I can see being able to help my grandparents during this transition is my mum ? she is the only person who?s been able to help them with so many things (she has siblings but they?re all untrustworthy or unreliable), and I know she wants to support her dad. The only obstacle is her mother.

I?m planning on going to my grandparents? house tomorrow and telling her that she needs to let mum back in so she can support grandpa, and that it would be a shame for grandpa to be put in a home because grandma wouldn?t let my mum support him (not to mention if he goes into a home, she?ll have to go too because she can?t look after herself). I am a little concerned about her being angry at me, but I want to look out for the best interests of my mum and grandpa. Any advice on how I should approach this?

So, my step dad has been around most of my life. Him and my mom met when I was three. When I was younger, it was fine, however we no longer even co-exist anymore. I have to spend more and more time away from home because being around him and feeling unsafe is becoming more and more common. I also have had a lot of feelings come up lately about him and as a result, am in the process of finding a psychologist. My previous psychologist shut down her practice. 

&#x200B;

A memory came up recently and it triggered a very different mindset about my home situation. My mom stayed with someone who she thought would hit me. She would never let him do it (one time he just about elevated, but she stepped in), but knowing that she chose to stay with him even with the risk kind of puts a damper on our relationship. I have been thinking about this a lot lately. 

&#x200B;

His treatment of me has been pretty abysmal. When my sister (his daughter) was born, it was like a switch. There have been small things, like him telling her she's his favourite while I was in the house, and to not be like me when she grows up. He never says stuff like this in front of my mom. Sometimes he uses me as ammunition when they get into fights and says things like ""Why don't you ask YOUR daughter?"". The last part is the comments he makes directly to me. What he says in front of her is usually along the lines of ""What were you doing, whoring yourself?"" and ""What did you get up to last night slut"". My mom never says anything when he says these things, but it's made it very hard to be around the house. I feel he's just counting down the days until I'm done school so I can move out. I feel like I'm just messing up his family. My mom has never said anything, but when I talk about it, she doesn't really acknowledge it. 

&#x200B;

Now. I know a big that will come up is that I can move out since I'm an adult. And I will be, come September. My second year of school is at a remote location, and chances are I will really need the financial support from my mom. However, until then I need to survive and try to save money while living at my mom's for free.

662,Luvyourwork,Relationships,9,c6cv88,2,"**TL;DR;** : I've been with my wife for a long time and love her deeply but am terrified to share with her that sometimes have bisexual fantasies. How do I come to grips with myself and share with her while causing her the lease amount of pain?

When I[m] was young I experimented sexually with a friend[m]. My memories of it were of innocent exploration. Finding out of what felt good to ourselves and making each other feel good. It involved mutually masturbating and some oral too. It eventually stopped. My friend and I went to separate schools and didn't see each other often anymore.



I never developed a trust level deep enough to experiment with a guy friend of mine like that again. At some point I read in a book that what I had done was okay, that actually it was quite common, and that it didn't indicate one way or the other if I was gay or bi or straight.



I took that perspective to heart because in my family it became clear over time that being gay meant something was wrong. I found hope that I was still 'okay' because this book said my experience didn't amount to much.



Fast forward, I experimented through high school and college and beyond exclusively with women. I had a couple longer term relationships and then I met the woman who would become my wife. Everything was groovy.



At one point back when my wife and I were still just dating, I tried to share with her the above story about experimenting with my friend. I was a crying wreck about it. Her question was, well, are you attracted to men? And I'm honestly still not even sure how to answer that question, but I said NO! of course not. I couldn't, and still can't imagine the consequences of suggesting I might have some non-straight inclinations. I clammed up about the subject. Neither she or I have brought it up since. It's been close to ten years.



Fast forward again to this past year. I've gone pretty deep down the NSFW reddit rabbit hole and have looked at all types of porn imaginable. And I've gotten off to a lot of stuff that can be classified as less than straight. Or even if it's straight, I often envision being the woman in the scene rather than the man.



It started off small, and I kind of thought if I gave into it, it would run it's course and pass. Now I have all kinds of recurring intrusive thoughts involving men and I don't know who to talk to about it. I'm afraid to talk to my wife about it. I'm afraid to talk to my close male friends about it. It just stays bottled up inside of me.



Recently, my wife and I started watching Easy on netflix and it has some bisexual story lines in it. After watching one of the episodes she kind of off handedly mentioned how she believes sexuality is just a spectrum and we all fall somewhere along the line. I was happy to hear this, it gave me hope that if I had the guts to tell her she might have empathy and acceptance for me.



I'm afraid that if I tell her this about myself it might break her heart and destroy her. It would be something that she couldn't offer, and another belief she has is that your spouse is the one and only and should be able to bring, or not stand in the way of the others happiness. I know she wants me to be happy.



I'm posting this because the past week on /r/sex there have been a couple posts about men exploring their sexuality and I have these fantasies but I know it's wrong to do anything about them without consent.

I have a roommate. Our term is supposed to end the first of July so a couple of days. Needless to say, our living together has not been easy. Some overview of what been going on can be seen on my last post on my profile 

I wanted to be fair and wanted her by herself to come to the decision to leave. She eventually did so without any input from me which lifted some pressure off my back as I would not want to kick someone out. A big reason why I knew we wouldn't work is because one her dog is not trained (he tries to charge growl and run towards anyone who enters our apartment. My roommate has to literally leash and restrain him whenever I have a new potential tenant or anyone come. But beyond the dog, there are other issues as well that were described in the previous link.

Although she was the one who settled on the date of the departure, she started changing her mind and wanted to extend it by one more month. I obviously didn't want to and cordially friendly mentioned she should continue looking around, she'll find something. At this point in time I did find someone who wanted to take her room and we were in the process of finalizing the agreement, but the only thing that was remaining was that my current roommate didn't find her place yet and I felt uncomfortable with this as my current roommate kept on letting me know her apartment search and kept on saying she was stressed and it's so hard and yadda yadda. I let both parties know what was going on with the situation and hoped my roommate can figure it out soon. After a couple of days my roommate reluctantly finally gave me her blessing to move forward with the guy, but by that point he didn't want to sign the final agreement and this is how I allowed myself to screw myself over because my roommate turned out fine as that same day I heard the bad news, she found an apartment that she liked and applied for it. 

I was able to stomach this loss and learned my lesson and didn't tell me roommate the news and was happy that at least she'd be gone by the end of this month. She eventually did ask when she heard someone new was stopping by, and I let her know in a non blaming way that I think I waited too long for him and he found something else. So we're both waiting for her application to get accepted, and I started to show people the room again. Two days ago I brought a new potential roommate over to show her the place. This new person was concerned about overall noise levels of the neighborhood and the building. I reassured her that everything was good, it's not noisy, people aren't blasting music, etc... I said sometimes on the weekends there's might be people outside chatting but that's it. We were having this discussion all in front of my current roommate because we were in the living area and she needed to restrain the dog. The discussion smoothly shifted to why my current roommate and I didn't work out or something like that. And I say, ""Yeah we get along perfect. The only thing is the dog and I would like to buy furnishings yadda yadda"". You know, just giving a little detail because rhe new person could obviously tell we get along. When I said that, my current roommate sort of made a face, and she started ""and other things!"" In my head I'm a bit confused and think oh okay I'll be more detailed, and add ""Oh yeah! My roommate wants to explore other neighborhoods too. But I like this neighborhood ahaha"". This is when my roommate decided that she wanted to chat more and basically was like ""Yeah I don't like this place/neighborhood. So many people outside. So loud. So many people about. I like quiet. So busy and very loud "". And goes on and on making out my place to be the nosiest place ever. I look at her incredulously in shock, because not only is it not true but that this was the only thing this new person really asked about. I respond basically saying ""Haha that's not true at all!"". And try to reassure the new person, but I can see that I already lost her and she was looking back and forth at us. And I had to tell her, that I have no incentive to lie to her. She lives close, she can stop by block at any time.  

She leaves soon after. And I immediately confront my roommate. Like why would you do that, etc etc. This neighborhood isn't loud at all. You made the decision to leave for whatever your reasons were. In my voice I was trying to remain calm but inside I was FUMING. I was thinking in my head, that I already screwed myself over once because of this situation, and now she's actively trying to prevent me from finding someone. Her response was that, it is loud yadda yadda and that this new person should know. And we basically enter an argument about this. I was so mad but of course tried to be cordial. The conversation was cut short though as she had to go to laundry. And I just leave to my room still very much seething. I just couldn't wait for her to leave at that point as I'd no longer have to deal with her problems and entitlement. 

Needless to say, I've been keeping my distance the past few days because she's supposed to leave in a week. It's uncomfortable for me because it's my home, but I could survive. The reason why I'm here asking for advice is that just yesterday she informed me her application got rejected. I accepted the news while showing sympathy. Then today she messages me if she can stay another month, and it'll help her to know as she's stressed atm.

What do I do. I obviously don't want her living with me anymore. She's just so exhausting to deal with and I am still FURIOUS about what happened. I'm unable to buy a couch for the place because of the dog so I can't even use my living area. And this is my first apartment, I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of telling her things like don't use my bowl as her stereo holder, or other stupid shit and she just argues with it. So I gave up after the first try. But on the other end, I live in an expensive city and need half of the rent. I can Airbnb the room once I buy furniture though so that's what I was expecting to do once she left. But on one end, it's financially easier for her to stay one last month. 

I really don't know what to do. I need help and I need guidance soon as I haven't responded to her message yet and I need to return home eventually. I'm sitting in a cafe now.

I went to Primary School with this girl (lets call her E). I was obviously discovering what love really was back then and I was dumbfounded, so I never really took to crushes.

Fast forward a few years, we had finished Primary School and now were in separate schools. We never spoke much until like 2 years when we randomly came in contact. We spoke a lot (we were like 13). We use to voice chat, and really just goof around. I was sort of interested in her but never cared much about it, I wouldn?t take my teenage years serious. This continued for a few months till we lost contact again.

Now were adults, we bumped into each other in a bar recently in a totally foreign country where we both are going to university for. We?ve started speaking a lot now. And I must say, I like her. I want to be with her. We are always speaking on Instagram, sending each other videos, pictures (not sexual pictures ?) and saying Good night and Good morning to each other.

667,250lbManNamedChuck,[new],8,c6chf2,2,"My girlfriend and I have been together about a year and have lived together since Fall 2018. About 6 months ago she crashed her car and was arrested for a DUI (her first encounter with the law ever --not even a parking ticket before). She's currently slogging through the diversion program, and has even taken on a second job to help cover court and vehicle expenses.

She feels really bad about the whole thing and is pretty hard on herself. Being an introvert her stress reaction is to pull away, and activities that usually bring joy like mountaineering, rock climbing, trail running, or time with friends are viewed more as chores than things to live for. I still invite her to activities, but she usually declines and spends the hours we're together browsing Instagram and Facebook, and texting friends. Occasionally, she snaps out of her catatonic scrolling and expresses her interest in me, but days or weeks can go by where I can't really tell if she's lost interest in me or just overwhelmed with her situation and doesn't have the energy to give a shit.

Part of me feels the right thing to do is to be more insistent about going and doing things together with the assumption that she just needs a little push to get out the door. But another part of me feels like we're at the end and that I should move on and let her choose her own path. To be fair, we were both feeling a bit lost in our lives before the DUI, and were talking about moving to a new area and/or exploring new career possibilities. But these were things we were considering doing together. Now, I'm not so sure.

TL;DR: My girlfriend got a DUI and no longer seems to care about our relationship. I'm reaching out for perspectives on what I could do to support her better, whether I'm wasting my time, or maybe this is really more about me and my needs and my inability to reconcile them within the new limits of my relationship with her.",1561677091.0,My [44M] girlfriend [35F] got a DUI 6 months ago and the fallout has taken over our relationship.,0.75

Hello everyone,

I don't know how long this post will be. I just wanted to share my situation with this community. Will write things as they come up in my head, so maybe there'll be no logical developement. Telling you in advance that I'm not an english speaking person, so please forgive any of the mistakes I'll make.

Me - male, 19 y.o. atmGirl - female, 18 y.o. atm

Well, to start I need to go back two years ago, when I was in third , high school, grade, I live in Italy so don't know what grade it will be in your country, but students are 16 y.o. +/- 1 year. So during one of the Physical Education lessons, for that year we've been coupled with another class of the same grade, me and my male classmates were having a break, and in the meantime girls were playing, I do even remember what, but don't know how it's called in english. After some time of watching them play, I 'threw an eye', sounds wierd in eglish, but it's like 'pointed out', on one girl. I don't why, well actually I do, but that's definetely not the whole reason, as brutal as it sounds, we were rating the girls, guess it's normal, and after finishing every girl, I remained gazing at only one. She was not the ""most beautiful in the school"" type or something like that, she was, and still is, a very common girl, from physical point of view, can't talk about the personality, but we'll get into it. So after that day up to this moment, and don't know for how much more,she has remained in my head.

It was mid-spring when it happened, you know, the time of the ""rebirth"" of the nature and all that, the time when people start to feel that the holidays are close and can't wait for it. For some days, the image of this girl was brewing in my head. Then I decided to do something. You know, I thought like ""Why not? If I liked her, I'd love to know her better. I may regret not doing it"". So, being in that situation with zero experience, I wanted to do something extraordinary, not even consulting my friends or parents, just brute ""Fuck it, I'll do it how I want to"". With the help of today's tecnology and social websites, I was able to identify this girl. At first I wanted to write a poem, at that time I was feeling like an illuminated human being capable of anything, then after a couple of days and tries, I even consulted my writing teacher at school, it wasn't coming out well. Then I remembered being a kind of a good painter, hadn't painted for years, but still was feeling confident. After looking up her instagram posts, I decided to draw a couple of portraits (with pencil). They came out pretty decent, at the moment I was satisfied and left them as they were. Next I wanted to add a bundle of flowers and I did it. Next day I went to school one hour, or so, prior to the ring bell and left the bundle of flowers inside a bottle of water (knowing that they would stay at school for the whole day) with the folder containing three drawnings, all this in front of her class's classroom. Days pass, obviously she doesn't know who left her such a dilevery, noone knows except me. Days pass... I realize that I gotta present myself, but first I tried to explore some things from the teacher we had in common. Talking to her made me realize that it was kind of a good move, everyone was excited about it, so I wanted make another step. Ah, forgot one thing. The day I left the 'delivery', I wanted to see if she had brought the flowers at home. She hadn't... I left the message on the wall (on paper, but attched to the wall). Then we exchanged messages for a couple of days in this way. So, going back to the 'next step'. I decided to invite her out one night. At this, I had to ask some help from my good friend/classmate who had a lot of contacts with her classmates. He helped me pick the place, based on the info we had recieved. But I didn't book it, wasn't obviously 100% sure about the outcome. For the presentation of myself and the invite to go out, I had painted again, but this time with a twist. Being a fan of calligraphy, I also beautifully wrote the invitation phrase on the painting. Then rolled the paper, like it's a medieval message, with a nice red rope, put it into a little red package and poured inside some red and white roses's petals. I was ready, the emotions were alredy popping. Next day, during the 15 min pause we have, in the garden, where most of students go to take a break, while she was surrounded by her classmates, I've made my move. I presented myself, very very ankwardly, asked her out and gave her the package. She was shivering and said ""No"". Then I said or think I said ""If you change your mind, my number is inside"". The I went back to my usual spot I stand in during the breaks, and felt destroyed. Destroyed in all aspects. But I wasn't mad at her. After some days, I tried to think about it, and actually I still think about what should I have done differentely. Everything seemed so perfect to me, no reasons to say ""No"", but still she had said it. After couple of days she stopped me and said the she was very pleased with what I have done, but still didn't accept it. I simply replied ""Ok"" or something like that, was shocked again and also didn't want to provide her with any further discomfort. That was the last of the only two face to face conversations I've had with her.

After all that, maybe for a month or two I tried to forget about it and move on, but seeing her everyday it was not easy and I'm still not able to do so. Still today, two years after... Incredible

Thinking about why she had replied that way, I came up with that I, how many would say today, was very creepy. In fact it's all very strange for anybody. You find a folder with images of you and a bundle of flowers with no message, just ""For \[name\]"", then you find messages on the wall, then this person comes to you asking if you want to go out. What would you say? At first I'd probably also say no. But seen the situation you can maybe gain some info from your friends on who this person is. But in fact he's a stranger, a complete stranger.So my mistake was, that I did such a thing not knowing her at all. You can't do such things to a stranger, because he doesn't know you and your intentions. I understand that nowadays a lot of teenagers just look for a one-time partner or just want to look cool going out with a particular person, I'm not that type at all. I love talking to people, I've never done anything bad to anyone, I'm trying to be as gentle as possible with anyone, you know the good old gentleman? I'm trying to be one, because I think that everyone should be like this. I look at many of teenagers of my age, younger and older and see basic things which are done in not a good way. I came up with this lifestyle because of my education, huge thanks for it to my parents. Also another thing which I stand out for is dressing. You see all these 'hypebeasts', all these street fashion, it ain't me. Suit and tie, that's me. At first everyone at school was looking at me like I'm mad or something, but after years they settled down.As to my social experience after that situation, I understand what I should do, and I know I am capable of it, I had overcome a very big blockage while presenting myself to this girl, but for some reason I can't. Just can't. It should be easy to start a simple conversation, with some simple questions, but I can't do it. Seems like my mind stops working. If someone starts talking to me I feel very happy, but can't sustain the dialogue. Strange stuff... Also I understand the importance of the eye contact, and I want to make it, but when the actual moment comes I can't, something inside id blocking me. It's like making a project, preparing for it, but when I have to execute it I just don't. And it's like this with any girl, absolutely any.

The good thing though out of all this condition, is that I decided to practice more and more my painting skills. I decided to go with charcoal portrets drawning. Eventually willing to make some spectacular pieces of this girl and send them again to her. Or anybody else I don't know, I'll see, but the thing that drives me is the thought about her. I don't know how I'll do in the future, because we are doing our graduation exams and then I'll probably never see her again. Maybe I'll eventually forget about her, maybe not who knows, the thing that she has been in my head for a bit more than two years is very interesting, and I wanted to share this experience with you.

Thank you very very very much if you've read the whole post! You are a great person! If you have any advices to give me on anything or have any thoughts just write them.

669,MRSMAYOHOLA,[new],13,c6cdkb,1,"Hi people of the internet,


Throwaway for reasons,  he is on this Reddit so I try to be vague.


We've been together for 1.5 year.  I'm from  Denmark, he is from new Zealand. We live in Australia now. 



John had done some things in the relationship that made me doubt a lot.  We were serious from the start because I'd the country differences and if we wanted this we should go for it.


He has done some things (32 situations) that could've been or are seen as emotionally abusive and physically controlling.


We've been through some counseling because I slip away in a depression since emigration and I thought I just blamed him (moving was for him 70%) but through the sessions him behaviour became clear and I felt myself getting less and less crazy,  which is honestly the best feeling.


John and I work well together.  We are exactly the same advise from a few things,  how to act towards other people (I help, ask and interact) (He questions everything, doesn't help out of his own and doesn't ask)
Now that he is in therapy things go better and they think he is high sensitive or on the autism spectrum. He has been receptive of this. 


When we got back together for a conversation after we broke up he told me to have a look through his messages because he had nothing to hide.  An odd number popped up saying hi. I scrolled through and found stuff.  The conversation was back in January when we first moved in together in Australia.  He was flirting with his ex. Telling her that he wanted to marry her and not me,  because ge only knew me for a year.  That her ass was better than mine (He bullied me with this by saying ""you'll get a compliment when you work out more"")
Asked her for pictures constantly and to slowly undress and to describe herself.  He did it to her.  This was all in 1 day. 6-700 texts. I read them all. 


He takes full blame and sticks to his excuse that it was because things between us were going so well. 

A lot of the times I think John is a good guy, he just fked up. He made a mistake. 
But this mistake together with everything makes me wonder what I'm fighting for and why.  He had hurt me like no other and the pain gets close as to when I lost my mother.  Just a black hole of loneliness. It can also be the fact that I don't have anyone here.  I live on my own now and so does he. I just don't know where to go from here?

Should I forgive,  forget,  or do the obvious thing and go no contact while building myself up? I still love him and when he is with me I feel good.  I just also feel that i don't deserve this stuff.


TL;DR I was deep in a serious relationship (moved counties) and things slowly went worse. He was emotionally abusing and controlling to me and apparently ""emotionally cheating"". He is in therapy now and I often still see hope since he did the things because he didn't know better and it was a mistake.  Things go better now but i just catch myself overthinking.
Can anyone help me in this by giving advice and maybe think along ?",1561676509.0,"24F and 25M. Broken up now, but can things be forgiven?",0.67
670,UpperAnxiety8,Non-Romantic,1,c6cdb6,3,"This might be a doozy.

My brother and I have always had a weird relationship (nothing weird). We go through periods when we get along and are relatively close, and periods where we absolutely hate eachother. Right now we are in the latter. He recently broke up with his girlfriend(22F) of 4 years. His behaviour and actions have been absolutely awful to our family. He has been passive aggressive in small jabs towards me. He has also been becoming more agitated and worked up at small things, and recently yelled aggressively at my mother because she offered him more food at lunch. He has never had any eating or food issues from what I know and none of us know why he lashed out at her. My mother was extremely upset about this, and he has not spoken to her in over two days. We all live in the same house and he only works about 3 times a week, and all he's done is lock himself in his room.

&#x200B;

I work with his ex girlfriend, and today we took our lunch breaks together. She told me that they broke up because of a few reasons that he did not mention. He told everyone it was due to religious differences (our parents imposed rules on us to not date outside our race/religion, though they have always been super lax about things and I have no doubt that they'd accept his ex should they know about the relationship) and her parents' strict rules (she also isn't allowed to date outside of her religion, and is from a very traditional household). But she told me she broke it off because my brother was being increasingly aggressive towards her. He would snap at her for little things, and she would stop his behaviour immediately. She has been in a toxic relationship before so I came to the conclusion that she saw the signs and ended it before it escalated. He also does not get the hint that she doesn't want to talk to him, and will constantly message her and post 'heartbroken' pictures on his Instagram stories (which i've roasted him for, lol).  This behaviour concerns me as my ex girlfriend used to do the same thing to me, and though it has been 2 years since the end of that relationship, I still feel the after effects of it in my relationships today. I do not want my brother to be that kind of person. He is usually a really nice, popular and charming kid and is known to be the funnier one out of the two of us.

&#x200B;

The reason this concerns me is because my parents and I are very worried about his growing aggressive behaviour. My parents also travel for months at a stretch, and then my brother and I live together in our childhood home. I do not want to be stuck with a toxic brother. I get anxious/stressed/frustrated easily and I do not want to be stuck in that mindstate for months at a stretch. I also do not want him to be hurting the feelings of people around him. I also want our family to get along for the limited time we are together ( they plan to travel for around 9 months with 2 short visits planned in the middle.) My mother was extremely shocked and saddened by his outburst as he said some extremely hurtful things unprovoked things.

&#x200B;

How do I bring up his attitude and actions to him and get him some help? I know this could just be him being a jerk in the aftermath of a breakup, but this behaviour reportedly started before they broke up. I want to involve my parents as minimally as possible as they are constantly working/stressed about work/family. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - my brother is transitioning from part time jerk to potentially full time toxic douchebag. I don't want it to impact our family as our parents tend to travel for months at a time and I will have to be stuck with him. How do I bring it up to him without involving my parents?",1561676471.0,I (22F) don't know how to deal with my brother's (20M) increasingly aggressive and allegedly toxic behaviour,1.0
671,throwaway332244,[new],5,c6cc67,2,"I have been with my boyfriend for just over a year - we started dating a few months after we met online.  He lives in the city where I grew up and I live about a 6 hour drive away in another city for school.  The distance didn't bother me in the beginning of the relationship.  We would visit each other once or twice a month, usually for a few days at a time.

&#x200B;

But over time I have developed the desire (or perhaps the need) to bridge the distance.  On the one hand, it's been harder for me to deal with the LDR because after the first few months of being together, he stopped putting in as much effort with messaging and speaking over the phone (the only ways we can communicate when we aren't visiting each other). I have expressed that I'd like more thoughtful communication on his end when we aren't together, but he can get busy with work and I understand that he can't always be available to talk or have the time to put together sweet text messages.

&#x200B;

When we are together in person I feel very connected and supported, and my feelings for him have grown stronger as we've spent more time together and met each other's families - I've had the ""I could be with this person until the end of my days"" kinds of thoughts for a while now.  But being far away has become extremely difficult for me.  Simply put, I miss him a lot and it makes me very sad.  We also both agree that the dynamic is better for us when we are together physically.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I told him that I would like to move back to be closer to him as I'm finished courses and no longer need to be where I'm living now.  The main problem is that rent in the city he lives in is two to three times as much, and I wouldn't be able to afford my own place.  Unfortunately, there is no space for me to live with my family at this point, I have no friends there looking for roommates, and I'm not wanting to live with roommates I don't know as I need a quiet and comfortable space to work (I'm a graduate student and spend a lot of time working at home).  I feel that moving in with him is the best option for me, but when I proposed it to him I was met with resistance.

&#x200B;

He said that he would love to have me closer, but doesn't think he is ready to have me move in with him and possibly won't be ready for that kind of commitment for a long time.  He has stated several times that he has a fear of commitment or being stuck and feels that living together would make him feel trapped.  He also had a negative experience when he moved in with his ex-girlfriend and said living together ruined the relationship.  From what I understand, she wasn't very accepting of his work schedule and this caused arguments between them.  I have tried to reassure him that this won't be the case with me, but it is still a fear that he has and I respect that.

&#x200B;

I understand his need for his own living space and don't want to push him out of his comfort zone, but I truly don't think I can feel as connected and supported as I would like to in the relationship if we can't be together physically.  It seems to me that we have conflicting needs at this time, or that his desire for space and my desire for closeness are simply incompatible.

&#x200B;

Earlier this week, I was clear that I don't think I can be happy in the relationship unless we are together, and that I may have to step away if it won't be an option in the near future.  He said he will think more on it and will give me his decision later this week.  He's really wonderful and I don't want to lose him, but my happiness is definitely compromised by the distance between us.  

&#x200B;

Should I stay in the relationship even if he decides he doesn't want me to come live with him?  

Should I suck it up and try living with people I don't know so I can live in the same city as him?

**Moment of weakness**: My female friend (my old crush)(23) was in town and hits me up if I wanted to come over and have a drink. I thought it would be nice to catch up since I haven't seen her in awhile, but in the back of my mind, I knew something else would happen if I went. So we chatted and drank wine, and she opened up to me and got really emotional, so I hugged her and I listened to what she had to say. After she opened up to me, she kept on getting closer and closer to me as the night when on, likewise I was gravitated to my old crush. Before I knew it, I was laying down next to her, talking to her as I was still trying to comfort her. At that moment, I thought of what would happen next if I made a move on her... I would have sex with my old crush which I still had feelings for! At first, I was excited at the thought and I was getting ready to make my move, BUT then I thought of my girlfriend! It was the first time that I thought about of her all night. When I thought of her, I froze and I finally realized what I was about to do... I was disgusted at the fact that I even thought of cheating on her and that I was laying down with another women... I immediately got up, got my stuff together and left. I hate myself for that night! I hate that I jeopardized the best relationship I have ever been in!!! This happened around a month ago, and I still think about it. The guilt is eating at me but I deserve it.

&#x200B;

**What should I do?** I haven't told my gf what happened that night, because I am scared of losing her. I didn't cheat on her, but I thought about it that night but I didn't act on it! **Is the thought of cheating just as bad as the act of cheating?** I know I hugged and laid down with my friend but that's all that happened that night. **How much of a dirt bag am I? Should I tell her even though there's a high chance she will break up with me? OR, should I not tell her and take what I learned from this experience, and try to be a better boyfriend?**

Hello everyone.
I wanna keep this short as possible because I don't want to give away too much and it's late and I'm tired.

I'm 19 and from Portugal. When I was 14 I moved with my parents and brother to Spain.
Last June I met a girl who I'll call Laura ( fake name ).
We met at a park when I was with a group of school friends and she approached us asking if we saw her dog. We hung out the whole eveining searching for her dog around the park but it was nowhere to be found. It was approaching 11pm so I had to get back home. She told us that her dog had escaped her house and wondered out around the area a few times already so she wasn't too worried. 

A few days passed and we kept hanging out.
Almost 2 weeks later she told us that her dog has been found on a road near the park dead, someone hit it with they're car. 

This was a hard time for me because we got very close very fast the days prior and I had never had a friend who was a girl before.
She was deppressed for a couple weeks because she had the dog for almost 9 years.
We kept on talking and in January we became partners. It's the first time we have been in a relationship as far as I know. Things were going well until 2 days ago.

It was the 1 year aniversary of her dog's passing. We walked around the neighorhood around 7pm chatting and doing ransom stuff as we usually do because it's not as hot.
So now comes the fuck up.

It was getting 8pm and I took her to the park.
She had been avoiding it I assume because of the trauma. She seemed a bit nervous but I just kept talking so she'd calm down. We get to the park and sit on a bench. We start making out but she wasn't too happy. She stared crying and ran away.

I didn't try going after her because I feel like I should give her some space. I thought it would be a good idea to try and help her overcome her fears and we could bond more. I called her yesterday afternoon and asked her why she ran off and she hung up.

I don't know what to do now. I didnte call her again because I don't wanna seem overly agressive. I didn't call today at all.
Did I ruin things with her? This is the only time I've had a girlfriend I don't know if I should have gone to her house today to talk things out. Also sorry for any grammatical errors as I have stated above English is not my first language and I'm on phone.

675,slothlenny,[new],8,c6c08h,2,"[td;lr] Looking for advice on how to handle this situation regarding my ex gf.


Hey all,

I can?t really believe i?m writing this and asking for help but no clue what to do at this point so here it goes. I?m a [25m] start, basically I met this girl about 6 years ago now in a very magical way and we fell in love very quickly. She was beautiful beyond my wildest dreams. I found out after falling for her that she definitely had some issues of her own that ultimately caused us to be somewhat off and on for 3 years because she would just be crazy and act very immature at times. But i am immature too and growing too so I loved her so much through it all. But, I do admit as I was younger I definitely did not handle these situations that would arise in a proper manner at all, usually probably coming off that I didn?t love her when I actually just didn?t love her acting out in those manners. Eventually I ended up going to school elsewhere for a year to get my career on track and to hopefully be able to be a supportive person to her in her life and I did better in that school than ever in my life which I do owe a lot to her support. Untill towards the end when I made a huge mistake and told her something I did a long time ago out of anger but also the fact i couldn?t have it on my chest any longer and what I did was so out of character it was because at the time things were so stressful and difficult for so many different reasons (just life in general) which ended up in her breaking up with me. Well now it?s been 3 years since we?ve been together and I?ve tried so hard to win her back only to find out she?s been dating this punk ass who was always causing problems who I could?ve been so much more adamant about keeping him away but he snaked in like the snake he is right when she was most vulnerable.

&#x200B;

So I haven't been in a relationship for around 2 years at this point, which has been much needed as my last relationship was extremely abusive and possessive. I've taken that time on my own to grow and learn more about what I want in a relationship, and have built up some amazing friendships but not romantic relationships. I'm coming up on my senior year of college in the fall and this might be the last chance that I have to start a romantic relationship with this person.

&#x200B;

For some backstory on our friendship, we met a year ago when she went through recruitment for the business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi, which I had been a member of for a year at that point. We hit it off really well at the recruitment events and she and I grew close during the entire process of becoming a member. Afterwards, we would talk in person every week and text/snapchat on days that we didn't see each other. Nothing romantic was ever expressed from either of us, and I would say that we were more than acquaintances, but not super close. 

&#x200B;

It is important to mention that I am currently the president of my chapter of the fraternity, and she is also an officer. We both have a lot of respect and dedication for it, and it is something that we definitely bonded over right away. We both prefer it over our social fraternity and sorority respectively. We both have talked at length about ways to make it better, and talk about fraternity history for fun.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this past year, she is always staying after our chapter meetings to talk with me and ask me questions about my life and how I'm doing, and I'm reciprocating and making an effort to get to know her better as well. I was also in the process of joining a social fraternity at the time, which she was extremely supportive of through the entire process. We occasionally go out to get dinner before our chapter meetings and spend some time just talking with each other. At this point I start to develop a crush, which I hadn't felt this way for anyone during the past 2 years. Her face would always light up whenever we saw each other, and I was able to make her laugh which was something absolutely astounding to me.

&#x200B;

Now it has been a year since we first met, and I'll send her messages and snapchats during the day to which she'll open and not reply, or it'll be a very simple reply with not much thought put into it. 2 weeks ago she was very responsive but now has been distant. I've been wanting to tell her my true feelings and that I like her, but I haven't at this point.

&#x200B;

Was I simply mistaking her liking me for her actually having the same passion for the fraternity that I do?

I have been friends with M since we were in the 7th grade. We are now both in our second year of college. M was planning to go to our local community college so he could stay with all of his friends here, but it changed very fast. He came out to us a transgender sometime early during high school, but he didn't tell his family because they were very much against having anyone in the family be LGBT. During a school meeting, one of the teachers slipped and referred to M by the name that he goes by at school. When his family was confused the teacher basically outed him as trans thinking it would improve his home life or something. Clearly, it didn't.

For the next few weeks he would be out of school a fair bit and wouldn't tell us very much about what was going on at home. From the little he was willing to share, his family nearly disowned him but decided that they would send him to college in another state. While he was still home, he wasn't supposed to contact any of us because his parents saw us as a bad influence after learning that we supported his transition.

During this and before he moved away, he started showing more suicidal tendencies. Scars on his arms and legs became fresh cuts again. He would just stand by the table at lunch without saying anything. We would have to spam his phone with texts just to get a reply if we were worried about him, but the replies would be single words or short sentences saying ""dont worry"".

There were multiple points where I thought that he might have actually killed himself because he would send one or two vauge texts into a group chat with our friends. They would be along the lines of ""im scared"", ""i dont feel very good"", or ""i just want you all to know that i care about you"". A few times I broke down into tears because I really thought he was gone, but then I would show up at school and he would be standing there acting as if none of that happened. If asked about it, or asked if he was ok, he would say to ignore it.

Now that he has moved away, I feel like things have gotten a lot harder. I have no way of making sure he is ok and not hurting himself. Every time I try to talk to him about something, he just pushes me away. No matter what I say, he refuses to believe that I care about him. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I would be in life if I hadn't met him. He has brought so much into my life, and I cannot thank him enough for it.

Recently, he has nearly disappeared. He saw his family about a week ago, so I know that it has left him in a bad mood. As far as I know, in the past 2 days he has only talked to me. All he sent was 2 texts dismissing my concerns for him and telling me I dont have to care. Every time I try to talk to him, he leaves me on read.

I don't know what to do. I really care about him, but he refuses to acknowledge it. He just keeps pushing me away. I feel like an idiot for caring for someone this much who does not even want me talking to him. I have gotten maybe 8 hours of sleep in total for the past 2 days because I am staying up all night worrying about him. If something happens to him, I don't think Ill ever know. The only reason I know he is alive right now is because I see that he is currently active on some of his social media. I am so sick of thinking that I am going to lose one of my closest friends every night.

What do I do? I am so lost.

TL;DR

My friend has been showing suicidal tendencies since high school, and I have been there to support him. Now that he has moved to another state, he does not believe that I still care about him and refuses to believe me when I say I do. He keeps pushing me away and ignoring me, but I just want to know that he is alive and ok.",1561672784.0,I (F19) don't know how to tell a friend (M19) that I really do want to be his friend.,0.6
679,Individual_Package,[new],12,c6bncf,1,"I broke up with my ex of 5 years 2 months ago because I thought the new guy I met was better and lost feelings for my ex. I cheated on him before and broke up for the new guy about 7 months ago and then the new guy betrayed my trust so I went back to my ex and we were back together for about 4months before I left him for the same guy again, but I made an excuse saying I couldn't choose between the two of them so I am not going to choose and everyone had a fair chance. I felt bad so I tried to stay as his friend cause I know he really likes me, but it wasn't the same anymore for me. Part of me wanted to stay in the relationship with him because I know I can see myself with him in the long-run, but the other part of me wanted to test the waters since I've never dated anyone besides him.

About a month into this friendship, he suddenly dropped all contact and ended our snapchat streak so I questioned him and apparently he wanted to be more still so he decided we couldn't be friends anymore. I tried to make contact by sending him snaps & look at his stories from time to time and it looks like he is happy without me. Don't get me wrong I am happy that he is happy without me after I broke his heart. During the relationship (when I went back to him not during the 6 years) I've lied to him a lot, and went to see the new guy.

Recently, he contacted my sisters if they wanted anything from Europe since he told them he was going and told them to not tell me, but I found out. I thought he is still trying to get back with me through my family, but I was wrong when I was  looking at his snapstories when he was in Europe and he posted in his story a new girl. I felt a little pain in my chest and I kind of missed him afterwards since he's never took me out like that. As of now I am not sure if I messed up leaving him and if I still love him or is it all in my head.

 I really like my new relationship since he's so different from my ex and I can feel that he really likes me, but I am not sure if I can see a future with him since my parents doesn't really like him and I respect their opinions. Maybe I haven't given myself enough time to think it through before jumping into another relationship.

TLDR: Meet a dude, seeing him for a month, seems awesome, but I?m a bit scared of boning and being ghosted, as he leaves for six weeks for the summer before he returns. Am I being to cautious?

I [37F] started seeing someone [35M], but my heart is jaded from too much crappy online dating. I feel a little hesitant to dive in, but think that I might be being too cautious, thought a Reddit second opinion might be helpful. Alternatively, it might thoroughly confuse things. 

He messaged me within a few hours of matching, and we had some good back and forth banter. Agreed to meet up, and then I picked a place for us as he?s new-ish to the city. We met up for a beverage which turned into three, and a three hour date. Tentatively planned our second date while on our first. Parted ways after a little street makeout. By the time I got home, he had messaged to say that he had a good time and that he would hopefully see me for the activity we had planned for the next time. I started work at a moderately intense new job with training, so our next date was about 9 days later.

Over the week, we had a few messages back and forth, and then went out for our second date, had dinner, wandered through a park, talked and touched for a while, had a beer. Five hours. More messaging when I got home. Since that day, we?vehad a bunch more dates, and a few sleepovers (though no home base!).

He?s communicative and kind. Since our second date, there hasn?t been a day that has gone by where he hasn?t messaged me to see how my day is going or to wish me good night. He sends me random rhymes, and adorable messages. Super compatible. We?re nerdy in similar ways, but both sporty and adventurous as well. Both career driven but not to the exclusion of a full life.  There was a week when we weren?t supposed to see each other, and the day before he left, he sent a message saying he already missed seeing me. And ended up swinging by later that evening so we could spend an hour together. He keeps me updated on his life, seems interested in mine, and I ended up meeting his only sibling visiting for a week.. He seems very interested in me physically (lots of touching, smooching). I told him two weeks in that I don?t have a sexual relationship without exclusivity, and he made an appointment the next day to get tested. We send each other pics and puzzles. I?ve been away most of this week but we are going to my friends cottage together this weekend. I then leave, and then he leaves for a month and a half. Our talks indicate that we?d be planning on being exclusive while away from each other. 

We haven?t ?gone all the way yet?, and I think I want to before he leaves. Well, let?s say my body does but my brain is being cautious. I?m just a bit worried about taking that step, and then having the distance cool things off. Or, would it give something concrete to look forward to? Or would the anticipation build over the next month and a half? I have no questions about our sexual compatibility - if this is what we are like at 3rd base, we good.",1561672470.0,I [37F] am dating a seemingly great dude [35M] but unsure about next step (aka going to bone town ),0.67

My grandma (79F) on the east coast is getting older and cant make the trip anymore to come see us. She's also getting pretty bad Alzheimer's and other health issues.

Now, I'm not close to my maternal side family. They're all narcissistic assholes who constantly make everything about them or my older sister. For example,  I visited them 2 years ago to spend time with my grandma, only to have the entire week be about my sister. Every conversation I had was about her. Over dinner we had to listen to her vent about whatever she thought ruined her day. She even talked about her vibrator not pleasing her anymore over dinner. I try to initiate phone calls, only to be hung up on if they want to do something else. They dont call any of us here. 

I also do not get along with my sister,  even though I've tried. We haven't talked in a year except me telling her happy birthday, and each one messaging ""Merry Christmas"" on Facebook.

Anyway, my mom wants her and I to go visit. My dad and brother have bowed out (my aunt hates men so they don't feel welcome, idk how shes still married). I'll go to support my mom - they can be rough to handle alone. 

But she wants to go during my birthday,  which would mean spending it with them. This is where the problem arises.

I dont want to spend my birthday with people like that. I don't want it being overtaken by my sister. I kinda just want to be selfish for one day out of the year.  Ideally, I would want my dad and brother with me too.

My mom thinks I'm being an asshole and doesn't understand why I dont want to go for that specific week. I dont care if we shift it and exclude my birthday. She said I should just go and be grateful she's buying the ticket as my birthday present. She also said that if we dont go FOR my birthday, we are not doing anything for it since I refused her gift.  

My mom seems to be taking this very personal, even though she's well aware of how bad her family is. My dad is refusing to get involved as a mediator to help us get this sorted.

My family has been through and continues to go  through a LOT. I mean BAD stuff; hospital stays, divorce, mental health  issues, disability, I mean that's just getting started with the story.

Regarding  finances, it's been one crisis after another. We're talking facing  homelessness if the rent doesn't get paid, going hungry because there's  no money for food, paying for doctor visits. A car breaks down and  someone can't get to work, with hundreds of dollars needed in repairs.  Family members on disability who have zero savings so guess who jumps in  to avert another crisis?

Almost  everything that has happened to my loved ones is not their fault;  they simply have had hell open up and spew out its worst. We're not  talking about helping deadbeats (please, before you post that I'm not responsible for their bad decisions, consider this detail). We're talking about people who have  struggled with unemployment, disability, and so forth. Those that are  able to work have a job (low-paying) and those that can't work are on  disability.

Title is basically tldr; I am having a very hard time staying in one relationship or appreciating the man I'm with. 
I was with my high school sweetheart for two years. Issues arised from infidelity from both pur sides, we break it off, and, almost immediately, I find a man (not the AP) from a longtime friend group. About a month in, he moves 3 states away and we have difficultly maintaining a long distance relationship. I'm more than certain during this time I was more afraid of being alone than being in a bad relationship, but he wasn't/isn't a bad guy. The long distance takes its toll and after a year passes, I decide to give up, break it off, and strike out on my own. And that obviously doesn't last long or else I wouldn't be here. 

This was very very recent and I've already thrown myself to the wolves AGAIN - another friend who was a shoulder to cry on during the breakup confessed his feelings and, once again, I'm in a relationship. 

None of these men are bad men. I know it's me who has the problems. I have difficulties being alone, I prefer to have a set plan for the future and having a significant other just seems like the right thing to do - it's terrifying being a college student and not knowing what comes next and I suppose by being a relationship it's easier to lean on someone with those difficulties than to face it by myself. 

I don't know how to help myself with my insecurities. Therapy is obviously a must, I know that, I just have no one else to talk to and this seemed like a good place to just rant and, well, ramble.

Ever since our first date he made it known to me that his ex (F 25) lives right across my house, so we are basically neighbors and I did happen to know her because she used to hang out with my sister but I didn't really pay much attention to that girl being his ex, I just shrugged it off. That's all until he started calling me her name instead of mine, and then his mother, friends, and rest of his family started comparing her with me, saying how I was better than her, and nicer and that she used to be mean to him and make fun of him because of a disability he was born with (which I don't remember what it's called ,but it had to do with his eyes) Anyways, long story short, during this relationship I felt like I was living in her shadow or something, even though he'd swear she meant nothing to him. He ended up breaking up with me for an unknown reason, and after a whole summer of me being an emotional wreck I found out by his mother that he moved to another country for a better life, but before he left he payed a visit to his ex and her mother but didn't even bother to tell me the real reason behind breaking up with me. It really hurt me when I found out, because they would all speak badly of her, and yet she is the one that gets to see him before he leaves, and I stay in the dark, not having a clue about it.

\- she mentioned a guy hitting on her in the bar who she took him aside(she was very vague also about this part) promptly dismissed and became his ""wing(wo)man"".

\- she then went of with some of her friends and this group of guys to the strip where they bounced between clubs and she was then bought free entry to a club having a water party, where the centre of the club was filled with water or something?

\- she then went into the water but due to it being so deep in the middle she climbed on one of the guys' shoulders to get out of the water.

\-Later she left the club with this guy, most of friends and a few of hers, where she then went and stripped and chilled on the beach as her dress was wet (she was also vague here about what they did, probably due to the alcohol affecting here memory though).

\-she then returned to the hotel with friends and guys around 4 and slept.

With what at first seemed likd a simple everyday highschool relationship with a girl \[15f\], it's now turning into this toxic thing that he doesn't realize he should get out of, at least in my opinion. Of course they're ""in love"" and everything and have plans and this and that to get married and move out together, whiched we've all dreamed of when we were young. But she's changed him. He used to be active. He would get on these programs and design cruise ships or hop on minecraft and build something cool. He used to love baseball and all this but now he just sits on his phone and talks to her. My parents have tried to limit his phone time with her as well as limit seeing her because there was this whole sex debacle that was discovered about 5 months ago where the two lovebirds were planning to have unprotected sex. Which my brother did not see as a red flag whatsoever. I should also note that this is his first relationship, and outside of her he doesn't have many friends. I've asked him what he sees in her and he simply told me he likes the kissing and cuddling.

I can tell my parents efforts are being wore thin and forcing a breakup is like walking on ice.

690,PrimalScreams,[new],49,c6awha,0,"I have been living in another country for 18 months and due to circumstances I had to come home. I didn't really want to live with my parents, but I asked and they said they would love to have me since it isn't for very long (5months maximum).

My Step-dad meditates in the morning, which means he wakes up at about 4am, turns on the kitchen lights until about 4.30, does meditation in the spare room next to mine until about 5 and then turns all the lights on again doing stuff in the kitchen until 6am when he leaves for work.

Because of a window above my bedroom door, the lights shine right into my room, and because of the shape of the house it is ver echoy and loud. I can deal with the sound, but not the light.

I also have to note, since I flew in from the other side of the world two days ago, I'm dealing with jetlag and struggling to sleep.

I woke up when he did this morning, and I wandered out there after his meditation and asked if he could use a different light or a lamp instead of the big flood lights in the kitchen (they are kind of in the shape of a big wagon wheel with about 8 lights on them). I would have liked to hear some compassion, that he understand how I feel and maybe he could try using a different light, it's not a lot to ask overall, but he snapped at me saying it's not going to happen. I said that I don't have options, but he does with lamps etc and he said I do and I should put a pillow over my head, and that there is no discussion to be had.

I was kind of taken a back by this, and got annoyed very quickly that he was so rude and snappy.

Mum said he is just grumpy because of car troubles, but I don't think that excuses him for taking it out on me.

I also acknowledge that this is not my house, and I have asked to live in their space, but I still don't think it was very fair to snap at me.

I have only been here two days, and haven't had time to invest in some black out curtains, but out of all of this, if the big light is his only option that is okay, but I'm more pissed offed that he wasn't even considering how I felt nor how both parties light be able to achieve an outcome we can both be happy with.

So now I'm considering making both of us miserable, when he wakes me up in the morning, I will play music (since I'm right near where he meditates) and if he doesnt wake me up, then I won't play music.

Probably putting my foot in it, but if he's going to be a hard ass, then I'm going to be a shit stirrer.

Edit: I also want to note that characteristically my Step-dad has always been stubborn to change, he wants things that way he wants them and how he has always had them. When I was young and he came into our lives, our lives changed to suit his, and I was too young to voice my discomfort with this. Now I am old enough, and I feel like I tried my best.

TL;DR Boyfriend has anxiety issued and I can't tell whether I'm being manipulated by him or if it's anxiety issues that are causing the issues. Maybe it's a combination of both. I just don't know. 

So, I've been with Mr E for about 7 months now and I'm struggling to see whether I am being manipulated in this relationship. He always does really sweet things for me and my family and honestly seems to care about me more than anyone else has.

We're best friends, we have the best sex and neither of us have ever felt so comfortable around the other. Most of the time, things are perfect, but there are times it's a nightmare.

Mr E has anxiety issues, issues that he's never told anyone but me, not even his ex wife of 16 years. But these issues have led to him putting a wall up if he thinks he's going to get hurt. Therefore there have been times where Mr E has tried to end things with me because he's scared I'm going to hurt him. I've always begged him to stay and he has, and things have gone back to normal.

Last week we had a few days off work. We live in different cities, so I was due to get the train to his on Thursday morning, On Wednesday night, however, things went south. We were talking on the phone and I mistakenly mixed up the name of a person we were talking about with someone else's. We were talking about Sam, and I mistakenly said Paul since I had been helping my friend Paul through some marital issues with his husband. Because Mr E doesn't know Paul, he immediately assumed something dodgy was going on, and when I clarified who Paul was, he asked why I didn't tell him about Paul's marital issues. I said because he didn't know him, and then he argued that we're supposed to tell each other everything, so I asked if that meant every single conversation we have with other people. At that he became completely offended and decided to cancel our plans for the following day despite me apologising for offending him.

I told him I'd be at the train station in the morning as planned if he still wanted to go. He told me it wasn't gonna happen, that he'd made other plans, and that I was nasty. I went anyway to show him how much I cared. I waited for an hour and he just kept texting me to leave. Eventually I did. On the train, he called and said he was on his way to see me. I said it was too late and that I was going to see my mum and go shopping instead.

Throughout the day, he texted me a lot but my battery was dying so I couldn't use it much. He called me in tears, but I told him he had really upset me and that he can't just tell me to leave and then beg me to come back when I finally leave.

I saw him later and he opened up about some really bad thoughts, so we talked, and he decided to get help, and things went back to perfect.

This morning was his first therapist appointment at 10:30, so he texted me at 7:45 to tell me he was thinking of me, thanking me for my support and then said he'd text me after the appointment. I replied at 8:18 telling him I was thinking about him, I loved him, and all of that. He didn't reply before I got to work which was fine. 

I was busy at work so couldn't text again until about 11. He'd texted me, furious I hadn't texted him again to let him know I was thinking about him and since then he's been saying how much I have let him down and that he can't open up to me anymore. He says that I wasn't there for him. 

We also work at the same place, today was his day off, and he said he was gonna check CCTV to see if there was a time I could have texted. He's saying he still loves me and wants to be with me but just can't share things with me anymore.

Due to turbulence in my friendship with X at the time, I chose Z?s side and Z and I came out best friends in the end. Z hates X and X hates Z. This was very painful for me back then because having to choose between two of my friends was really really awful. 

Z is a very good friend to me, but recently I went through my own breakup and a lot of people who were supposed to be in my support system went MIA :(. X and I started talking at the beginning of June and have been hanging out semi-regularly for old times sake. Before this point, we hardly spoke for 3 years out of respect for Z. I?m starting to think that this was a mistake.

Z hates to hear about X and she doesn?t know that X and I have been hanging out. Their breakup was bad but it was bad on both sides and after years and years of agonizing about it I don?t think that X deserved what I did. I see it as one of my worst mistakes, especially now.

I just don?t know how to navigate this because X thinks I should tell Z but I know that it would likely create a irreparable rift between Z and I.

695,AmActuallyThanos,Non-Romantic,2,c6aqta,9,"This step sister of mine has always been  someone that I don?t really know. She?s an adult and she?s been out doing her thing ever since my dad married my step mom, so I never actually grew up with her, so there?s not an actual connection/bond between us like you would with a real sister. I never really thought a day would come where she would actually be like a big sister to me.

Now for context, she?s got issues. Drug issues, and my step mom has been obviously trying to help as much as she can. However, I?m not suppose to know this. My parents have been keeping all of this under wraps, but I?m able to connect the dots and it?s kinda obvious what?s really going on. That?s the context.

Last Friday she texted me. Which is really really strange because like I?ve said before, we don?t *know* each other well, AND she doesn?t have my number. It was super strange but the message she sent me touched my heart. She told me that she is there if I ever need anything, I can always talk to her, and it would stay between me and her. THAT was a big surprise, and almost immediately I actually felt like I was being cared/loved for by a sibling. As soon as I read the message I replied saying that I appreciate. After that I decided to text her again and basically let her know how much those messages really meant to me. But the. Came Tuesday.

Tuesday night my step sister was brought to the house and she was crying and I obviously knew something bad happened/was going to happen. I didn?t get to see her in person because like I said: my parents try and have kept this stuff away from me. Wednesday morning she was no longer at the house,  and that night I texted her asking if she was alright and was ok. At this point, I still didn?t know what happened to her. 

Until that same night I found out she was admitted to an addiction treatment center for a while. That?s a good thing though, however I can only imagine how stressful it must be for her and it?s kind of scary to think about. She never replied last night, but she finally replied this morning and she simply said that she was fine and asked if I was good. I said yeah, and that was that. I can?t stop thinking about it. Am I suppose to just leave her alone? She came out to me, and that meant a lot, the least I can do is pay her back by helping her out because to be honest, I think the reason she texted me that was because possibly she realized how it was like not to have someone to talk to in stressful situations. 

I?m not planning on necessarily helping her with her addiction problems (because there?s nothing I can do with that), but I just wanna help comfort her maybe just be a shoulder to cry on. Problem is I can come out and say ?I know what?s going on? because she still thinks I have no idea about what?s up with her. She may not want me to know that she does these things, but that doesn?t change who she is at the end of the day. 

What?s the best thing I should do? Should I check up on her in a few days? Should I tell her I know, if so, how?

696,throwaway61236872130,[new],2,c6ap9a,4,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months and recently we've been struggling a lot with our long-distance relationship. We met during first semester of freshman year and started dating throughout the second semester and into the summer. However, its been more than a month apart and I've been struggling to keep the relationship together. 

&#x200B;

Currently, I'm interning at a company in the city where we go to school, and she's taking a summer semester abroad in a country with a 12 hour time zone difference. I love her a lot and we've had no problems during our time together, and I feel like we've created a very healthy relationship where both of us have independent lives and can thrive by ourselves, but having each other just makes the experience better. Though recently it seems like the distance has been catching up with us.

&#x200B;

I'd say the core of our issues stem from our emotional efforts not paying off as they usually would if we were together. During my day time (her night time), I often find myself texting her until 3pm in the afternoon, mostly because I enjoy talking to her, but its had a detrimental effect on my work and development. Similarly, during my nights, she has trouble talking to me because she has classes and tests. 

&#x200B;

During times where we don't talk as much, we both feel like we're drifting away from each other. Whereas during times where we DO talk a lot, we both feel like we're having unproductive days and end up feeling bad for distracting the other. 

&#x200B;

It almost feels like I'm in a lose-lose situation because I don't want to lose this girl, especially because I think she's helped me grow as a person and has had a positive effect on me during my time in college, but also I think sustaining the relationship has just made me emotionally exhausted lately. Most commonly, there would be days (my time) where she would be upset about something, and I simply did not have the time or energy at work to comfort her and give her the amount of attention that she wanted. In worse cases, when she's upset with me, I don't have the capacity to guess what I did wrong and talk to her until she's completely happy again.

&#x200B;

There are still 8.5 weeks before we see each other again, and I'm just not sure if we can make it that far. I would love to revitalize the relationship once we're back in school, but I'm scared taking a break would cause both of us to drift apart, thus losing someone that's had a positive effect on me and has helped me grow a lot.

Any comments about how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!

697,Keijinbr,[new],5,c6alz2,2,"Hello everyone. I wanted to post to everyone my story to get all the advice I can get. The names on the story are all false, just to make things easier to understand.

&#x200B;

I met Chloe in june 2018, we started dating and it was coming along pretty well. At the start, we were friends with benefits, she lived pretty close to me and we could see each other very frequently.  


Then we started becoming serious and on october I asked Chloe to be my girlfriend, and we entered a closed relationship. Since we lived pretty close, I went to her house everyday after we started the relationship. I slept there, woke up and went to work and came back to her house each day. 

&#x200B;

After sometime, close to end of november-december, we started having minor arguements, and they are becoming more frequent as of today. Some examples are:

\-We disagree on the house chores. Chloe tells me I do too little and I think I do a lot, since I still have to work 8h/day and she has no job;

\-She becomes quite angry when I make noise, tumble on things and do some small mistakes. Everytime I tumble on something, she gives me a look or scolds me. I kinda understand because she has misophonia, but it's still annoying to handle that kind of treatment. I asked her to change, to comunicate things we less anger and more empathy, but she says I have to be empathic of her since this is her personality.

\-I was very jealous of some male friends that she kept talking on the internet that I knew she had relationships with them. I told her that made me insecure and she was very supportive, but also told me to look for therapy and try to work my jealousy, since it's baggage from being cheated in another relationship. I am currently doing therapy and am more secure in our relationship.

\-She has become more jealous since I went on some work trips on march of these year. I never cheated on her, and will never cheat, but Chloe thinks I'm hiding something from her. As an example, yesterday, Alana, a girl I dated only one day in 2013 (but am friend on facebook) sent some messages out of the blue, asking things that were hapenning in our College. I politely responded, but she went mad on me for answering those texts. Then I ignored Alana's messages and didn't respond anymore.

\-I told Chloe to mention this and some others jealousy episodes she had to her therapist, because I thought it was toxic, but she disagreed and told me she was not going to do that.

\-Sometimes, Chole asked me to tell lies to other people so she could prove a point with her friends or her housemate. At first, that wasn't a problem at all, but then I noticed that sometimes she lies to me just to prove she is correct or make her point.

\-Chloe was texting this guy, let's call him Mark, a guy she had a ""just sex"" kinda relationship. I never knew the entire conversation, but sometimes she answered him while I was beside her, and I saw some of the messages. One day, Mark told her ""You were very good when you did \[sex\] me"". I saw that message and was so shocked that I didn't say anything. I didn't confront her. Not so proud of it, I went through her phone one day after just to look how the convo ended, and Chloe didn't respond Mark anymore. The problem is, someday in march of these year I saw her talking to him again. The fact that Mark can flirt with her, and she keeps talking to him hurts me. Makes me trust her less. Also, why she didn't tell me about the message?

\-One month ago, Chloe just moved out of her house, leaving her housemate to pay the rent for herself, without any advice. I said I did not agree with that kind of decision, but since she made up her mind, I just helped her. That makes me think she could do something related to me as well in the future.

\-In the last 2 months, we had some major disagreements that made us respond to each other in passive-agressive way and sometimes, we showed each other comtempt. That looked to me like a sign that the relationship is ending.

&#x200B;

The problem is, when we are happy and together, we are really good with each other. She is caring, fun and makes me happy and smile. But we are growing distant as time goes by.

700,billieshergg,[new],1,c6akaf,2,"Hi there. 

In mid-March, my boyfriend of 1.5 years, Tyler (M24) and I got in a huge, blow out, absolute shitshow fight. It lasted a week, maybe more, where we would fight, not speak, and fight again. We lived together and I was under the impression that we were going to stay living together, until he told me offhandedly one day that he was looking to move in with one of his friends. This lead to another explosion on my part. I decided I was going to move back in with my dad, something I absolutely did not want to do, and Tyler acted like it was for the best for us, and talked about us compromising. At the time, I wouldn?t hear him out, I felt hurt and betrayed and like he wasn?t listening to my concerns. (Looking back, what he was proposing wasn?t a bad idea, but I learned my lesson the hard way.)

This was why most of our fights started. 

I would feel a certain way, and he would kind of try to tell me I was wrong. He likes debating, and I do not, especially about my feelings about certain things. They aren?t hurting anyone, so why am I wrong? He made me feel like my feelings were wrong, and when I tried to explain this to him, he would listen, but not change his behavior. I think maybe he was trying and I was overreacting, I was quick to be defensive. 

I didnt like cleaning up after him. He left laundry everywhere, refused to put away his clean clothes, the bathroom was a disaster every day. I work 55+ hours a week and didnt want to come home to a mess all the time. He is in grad school, runs an artistic business on the side, and works in retail. He has a lot on his plate, too, but that is not an excuse not to help me. I should?ve been more understanding with him, though. 

Cut to about two weeks ago, my dad almost hit me after an argument. He was all kinds of abusive towards my mom, so I was expecting him to treat me the same. It was just the straw that broke the camel?s back: I?ve been having problems at work, struggling to maintain friendships, and was in the process of losing Tyler. I wanted to kill myself. I felt - and feel - like everything is my fault and that I?ve ruined my life. 

Tyler was worried about me, and I didnt want to stay at my dad?s, so I went to his place. For about a week after I stayed over there quite a bit, and he started to get irritated with me for camping out there. 

We slept in the same bed, but never kissed or had sex or anything like that. But every morning when I woke up, he would be hugging/spooning me. I would lay there and look at him until he woke up, and he would lay there and look at me until we had to get up. 

The last night I stayed there was last Saturday, and he barely said a few words to me. I was a mess, I was sobbing uncontrollably and about to leave when he rolled over and grabbed ahold of me. He kept telling me it was gonna be okay, etc. 

The reason we haven?t gotten back together is because he wants to be alone. He says he has spent most of his life not in a relationship and he wants to go back to that, and focus on school and work, as his last semester was really rough. Last saturday night, when he was holding me, I kept asking him if I change would it be different, if I help more would it be different, and he said ?You are asking for a life You dont want.? He adamantly wants to be alone, and I want to respect his wishes. I asked how long he wants to be alone, and he said maybe a year at least. I asked him if I left him alone for a while, then in the meantime would he considering going on a date with me, and that we dont have to rush back into things. He said he would think about it. I told him I loved him, and he told me he loved me. 

I truly believe in my heart he wasnt cheating on me or anything like that. And he is the type of person who would tell me if he didnt want to be with me because of this or that. He wants to be alone, he says. 

The morning after all of this, we woke up cuddled together, and just laid there with each other for a while. Just looking at each other. And I wanted to kiss him, I wanted to remember when the last kiss was, so I finally just did it. And we pulled away for a second, then he kissed me. And that was that. 

*******So my question is: should I wait for him? I really, honestly love him. I have never felt so loyal to someone. I?m not attracted to other people the same way I?m attracted to him. I know I sound like a damn Disney princess here. Does it sound like he would actually be willing to give me another chance?

I know we both need time apart, obviously. I haven?t talked to him since then, and it?s a little different every day. Some times it?s really hard, and sometimes it?s really easy. But I miss him a lot. We both need to change and grow on our own time. I?m just scared of losing him, or of him finding someone else. I know that?s how life works, I guess I just want some wisdom, advice, or comfort.

702,TorsionFree,[new],18,c6ae81,2,"My wife [37F] and I [39M] have been married for 9 years, together for 13. We've had shared finances for about 10 years.

Somehow we've never learned how to have real conversations about money. Mostly - and I know appreciate what a mistake this was - I delegated to her the responsibility for paying our combined bills. Mostly they got paid on time, but many did not. This was especially true for the larger bills like our mortgage, power, and car payments when the money just wasn't there (largely because her income is seasonal, and because she usually doesn't plan to hold money aside from our biweekly paydays to pay monthly bills). Needless to say, my credit is what suffered most since these bills are all in my name. Yeah, I know, bonehead move on my part.

Then we had kids, and things got much worse. Expenses went up, income went down. She (somehow?) took out two credit cards in my name without my knowledge, both of which are over their limit. Our mortgage fell into default. This year alone we've spent more than a thousand dollars on checking overdraft fees. Yeah - those are just the fees. I received a notification for three more just while I was writing this post.

Anyway, the few times we've tried to have real conversations about budgeting they either turn into defensive behavior or angry hopelessness. Sometimes we agree on a plan, but neither of us holds the other accountable to sticking to it. She seems completely allergic to planning or budgeting, and my offers to take over our finances are rejected because she ""doesn't want to be treated like a kid with an allowance."" 

And in my view, this is the crux of the problem: her personal spending habits. Our income does cover our expenses, but there's not a whole lot left afterward for us to spend on ourselves. I've put myself on allowance in a personal account to curb my own spending, and have cut that amount back to virtually nothing while our financial dumpster has caught fire. But she continues to spend on herself out of our joint account and, if anything, seems to actually be spending more on herself now than before.

Clearly, we need professional help with how we communicate about our money. We're already in couples counseling for other issues, but I'm not sure whether our current therapist is the right person to help us with this conversation. We almost need someone who's two parts marriage therapist and one part financial adviser: someone who can look at the habits we've developed around money and help us make new ones together. (My dream world be a personal receivership where a third party is in charge of distributing all our money... But we'll probably have to figure out how to do it on our own, won't we.)

So,

TL;DR: When a couple's habits of communication about money put them in financial crisis, are there professionals that can help address the root cause (relationship issue) and the fallout (financial issue) at the same time?

Last week, he ended up telling me that he used to have threesomes on ecstasy on a regular basis for over a year, including with a girl I?ve met. I felt insecure, angry, devastated, and inadequate. I was worried he liked them better. But he was very sweet and reassuring, telling me I?m the only one for him etc. it was still hurting me even though I was trying to ignore it and I know it happened so long ago. 

Last night, he told me that if he found out something he didn?t like from my past, that he would still love me. Everything was back to normal. He?s sending me hearts and telling me we?re going to spend the rest of our lives together. Then, I started telling him things that I wanted to do in our sex life, and honestly most of this was because I felt insecure about his past and wanted to ?beat? them, so to speak. I suggested we do more of something we?ve done before, and then I also thought about the whole threesome thing.. I wasn?t comfortable with that, so I thought about bringing someone in to watch. (I thought about it for a split second and sent the text. I did not think it through. This is something I could never actually go through with). He was upset and asked me if I meant bringing another guy in. And I said yeah I guess I would prefer a guy since I?m straight. (It also made me feel really insecure thinking about having another girl there. I should have realized it would make him feel the same way). 

Since then, he has been raging at me, calling me all sorts of horrible names and saying my parents would be ashamed of me and that he absolutely hates me. All because I mentioned a threesome, and said I?d prefer a guy over a girl. And like I said, this was all a passing comment that I barely thought about, and nothing I would actually go through with. I have told him that many times and told him he?s the only one that I want, which is true, but he won?t believe me. I?ve never loved anyone like I love him, and I don?t want to lose him.

704,zuckermandrea,[new],15,c6acql,16,"

My (29F) boyfriend (28M) started dating after university. Almost 2 years ago we moved in together. We have similar values and interests and we have a lot of fun together.  We both work a lot and pursue advancement outside of work (masters, designations). I like spending time with his family and friends and I think that he feels the same.  We have had rough patches here and there, a lot surrounding the different ways that we express our love, with me wanting more physical affection and verbal affirmations than he feels comfortable giving, though he tries. He is also more career driven than me and would really like to live and work in another country, which is not really something I want but am willing to try since it is so important to him. 

I felt after about 3 years of dating that I knew he was the person I wanted to marry. Since then i have had doubts, but usually after talking about it and working on things my doubts are assuaged. I think what really decided it for me is that he is always willing to listen to my concerns and work to make our relationship better. 

Recently a lot of our friends have been getting married or engaged, and friends and family and acquaintances even constantly ask when we are planning on getting married. 

My bf and I have had the talk about marriage many times over the years and he has always made it clear that he would like to get married one day, once he feels more settled in his career, which I agree with; I would also like to be more settled in my career. 

But I recently decided to ask him if he knew if he wanted to marry me specifically, and he said he wasn't sure. While he loves a lot of my traits he had a lot of doubts about me and some of my personality traits (e.g. my temper, which is improving but still quick and hot, vs. His slow burn and grudges). He also said he couldn't picture a future with anyone else, that he can't think of anyone he'd rather marry, but he's not ready for marriage. I did clarify that I wasn't proposing that we get married anytime soon, just that I wanted to know that it was leading there, and he replied that he still wasn't sure.

I found this extremely upsetting and hurtful because this man knows me better than anyone and my general feeling is that he should know by now if I'm the one. I'm  concerned now that two years down the line he will find someone else and then dump me leaving me heartbroken and starting at square one. 

This is now causing me all sorts of doubts about whether he really loves me, compounded by the fact that he has so much trouble expressing his emotions. 

The question is, do I stick it out and hope he finds his way once he's ready? Am I overreacting? Or do I rip the bandaid off and break up, hoping to find someone who values me for me, and doesn't need more than 6 years to figure it out.

706,possible3some,[new],13,c6a6qs,7,"Hello Reddit! I?m looking for some advice. My husband (married 2 years, together 5) sat me down last night and said that he had been thinking about something for years now and wanted to float the idea: He wants to have a threesome with me and his best friend. At first I said no, absolutely not. The idea has never even crossed my mind and to me adding someone else means there must be issues in the bedroom. I?ve always thought our relationship and sex life were more than satisfactory and he assured me that he thinks so too. This is just something that he really wants to try. Admittedly I wasn?t very gracious when I said no and this morning I apologized to him for that. I also asked for some clarification on several points, namely these:

* Does he want to have sex with his friend alone? He says no, he has never wanted to sleep with his friend just the two of them. 

* Is he attracted to his friend and this is a way to satisfy that without cheating? He?s not *un*attracted to him, but he also isn?t wildly attracted to him. Apparently they did some experimentation when they were younger and never took it any further. He said that if my final answer was no he would never bring it up again and would not act on it. 

* Who would be in the middle of this sexy sandwich? Apparently, the filling in the middle would be me. His fantasy is for he and his friend to rock my world and most of the focus would be on me. 

* Had his friend brought this up before? Yes. I was unaware of this prior to this morning but I guess a few years ago his friend drunkenly admitted to being attracted to me and wanting to ?share? me. My husband said that it made things awkward for a little while but they?ve never spoken about it. This was the beginning of my husband?s fantasy. 

My dilemma is this: After thinking about it more... I kind of want to give it a try. I?ve always enjoyed spending time with his friend. He?s funny and easy going, and he brings out the more easygoing side of my husband as well. It doesn?t hurt that he?s also attractive, although in a different way from my husband. (Personally I?ve always found him attractive but that?s not the kind of thing I ever thought I should tell my husband.) The thought of being in the middle of a threesome is, um, more than a little exciting. 

Now the cons: My husband and his friend were nearly inseparable growing up and their friendship is just as strong now. To my knowledge, they've never shared a partner, although they did date twins once. I would really, really hate to see their friendship end over hurt feelings relating to a threesome. 

I?m not worried about my husband?s commitment to me or our communication skills, but I do wonder about his friend. My husband and I have experimented with kink and although none of it ended up being something we wanted to repeat, we did have great communication before, during, and after. His friend? I don?t know. I know he and my husband communicate well but the friend and I don?t have that kind of friendship. We get along well but we?ve never spent any time together just the two of us. 

Has anyone here navigated these waters before? Should I nix this right now? Is it worth even discussing?

I think we have had 8 days away from each other in 3 months. So, pretty fast moving (plus we knew each other before, and dated briefly previously)

My girlfriend is very jealous, probably to an unhealthy degree. She doesn't want me to hang out 1 on 1 with any of my female friends, and even when it's in a group setting with male and female friends, she still gets uncomfortable. She told me she's been cheated on twice in the past, so I understood her feelings at first. But it recently came to a head when she told me to cut off all contact with two of my close female friends. One, who I'll call Brenda, I've been friends with since high school and we're very close. The other, who I'll call May, I've been friends with for about 2 years. I very briefly went on dates with May when we met, but after 2 weeks her feelings for me changed and she broke it off, but we remained close friends. I told my girlfriend about May in the first month that we knew each other, but she has never been a fan of us hanging out because we briefly tried a relationship.

It started with my gf telling me to get rid of any pictures of May and I that I had on my phone. We argued about this for a while, me saying that she was just my friend and that I had no romantic feelings for her. My gf simply repeated that May must be more important than she was if I wouldn't delete some pictures. I wanted to stand my ground on this, even though it was just a couple of pictures of us at some concerts we went to (very innocent photos, nothing suggesting we had feelings for each other). I thought that if I gave in and deleted the pictures, it would be a slippery slope to me cutting off all contact with May (which is exactly what happened).

Brenda is a slightly different story with the same outcome. Before I met my gf, we sent each other a few random texts a week and hung out once a week or so. We are very close because of how long we've known each other, and my gf has been jealous of her since the beginning. I introduced my gf to her, and they got along REALLY well at first. I was happy because she wasn't as jealous and she seemed to make a new friend. But over time, her jealousy just got worse and worse and she started to hate Brenda. Eventually she got mad at me for texting her and asking to hang out, and told me I could only see her once a month. Brenda felt like her presence was a strain on my relationship with my gf, so she stopped texting me altogether one day. My gf feels like she is justified and that Brenda is the rude one for cutting off contact with me, but in reality it was her jealousy that made it this way.

I know I should not have let it get this far, but I really love my gf, and being with her has been great for both of us. But I keep thinking about how I let her control me and dropped two of my close friends, and the guilt is really eating away at me. I don't know how to get my friends back without breaking up with my gf. Please help I feel like an idiot.

If they send me a funny picture, it makes my day because I know they were thinking about me. If I text and they don't reply to me all day (totally fine, and I would never double text!) I think about it obsessively, and I get insecure, and it ruins my day. 


This is putting enormous strains on my mental wellbeing as I am just thinking about it always, often scared I've ruined everything or that he hates me now. I don't understand how I am fine without a man and a mess with one. 

Any advice, books, blogs or topic to read would be appreciated

I'll start by saying that 1- I'm disabled. It's not visible, I don't look disabled, but I have a muscles disease that makes me tired, and deal with muscle pain. The more I use my body, the more tired I get. Same with the pain. No treatment available for my condition. Fibromyalgia. I also have a part time job from home that requires me to use my brain. If I'm tired, I can't concentrate and work. Husband works night shifts.          

My house looks like a hoarders paradise. It wasn't always like that, but my husband is contributing to most of it. Leaving his clothes everywhere. Ignoring my demands to put his clothes away. His empty bottles, plates, etc.          

It's gotten so bad, there's stuff everywhere. I haven't been able to vacuum in 3 years.        

2 years ago, our kitchen tap broke. But because our house is such a mess, I haven't been able to call our landlord to come fix it. Too ashamed to show the house like that. So for 2 years, I've been doing dishes in the bathroom sink or in the bathtub.         

Whenever the doorbell rings, I get anxious it's someone we know that might wanna come over, and I can't open the door.

During his time off, he plays video games. If I need something like a pan and I can't wash it myself because of my health issues, he's gonna agreed to do it, but often will forget. Because he's engulfed in his game and then it's late and he's too tired.         

My dad was an alcoholic and I can't stand the sight of empty beer bottles. I don't mind if he drinks, but I asked him very early in our marriage that he pick up after himself. Well, as you guess, he doesn't. He drinks a beer a week, but forget about his bottles. I'm, so sick of it all.

716,FVWusko,Non-Romantic,2,c6976g,2,"So... I'd advise you to strap in and prepare yourself because this will be a long one.


It all started around 3 years ago, in high school. Our group of friends was basically inseparable (5 of us) and were the classic high-school clique. It was all great fun until I got together with one of them and entered a relationship. It was great at the time, imagine hooking up with your best friend who you have feelings for right after finding out that they are very reciprocated on her end! After a year, some red flags started popping up on her end. The usual jealousy, trust issues and constant checking of my whereabouts, text messages and other stuff along those lines.


Truth be told, in retrospect, I should've ended it then and there, but it went on for another two years to end up fizzling away a week after our third anniversary. But that's besides the point. A little bit after the one-year mark, I found myself in a bad place family wise and I started pushing everyone away. I was left with only that group of friends + my SO as people who I can talk to and feel good around. The main problem was, I was the only guy in the group and my SO started being extra jealous about one of them. Yes, she took the place of my best friend after the relationship started but it was *never* anything more than that. We were close and we were closer than to the other ones in the group.


Once my SO stated her issues with it clearly, I went insane. At first I was so mad that she could even think of something that way in a (near) perfect relationship. However I bottled it all up and fueled by other bad stuff in my life, my idiotic brain decided it was in a situation with only one way out. Keep my SO but cut off contact with my friend. It was *easy* only in the sense that it was at the very end of our high school education and I only had to have a small chat about it with her once before just cutting off contact without any detailed explanation. I know it was stupid, but bear with me, it only gets worse from here.


The other 2 friends, I stopped talking to as well. This wasn't because of my SO but because I was in that headspace where I thought ""Oh fuck it, I don't need anyone but my wonderful SO, I'll meet new people in college.""
And as time went by I saw how stupid that was and a year later, reached out and apologized to the two, subsequently cut off, friends and cleared up what happened.


My biggest regret, without any doubt in mind, is still not reaching out to my old BF. When I made amends with the other two, I was still with my SO and thought it won't end so I was super against reigniting the jealousy flame. But now, a year after the breakup, I'm thinking about it *daily*.


On one hand, I feel like I owe it to her, an explanation and an apology at least. I'm not even thinking about being close friends, or even friends, again because I'm not sure if I would forgive myself if I were her. But on the other hand, I think that going back into that and potentially opening up old wounds (I was told that she was, indeed, super hurt when it all went down) is a big no-no since I still do care, in a way, for her.


I've got a super-long text written up that I want to send, but I can't bring myself to do so. I did a very, *very*, shitty thing and I'll have to live with it for as long as I remember that friendship (AKA forever) and I would do anything to just take back my actions. What I'm asking is, is this something I should live alone and let it scar over or bite down on a piece of leather and dive in, hoping for the best?

717,WeRMiracl,Relationships,3,c69675,2,"So I a 20 something year old have had a girlfriend that is also a 20 something year old. The relationship has lasted 2 years and is both of our most significant relationship. 

We always joked and talk about what life will be like when we marry. I get along with her family and her mine. Our major rule in the relationship is that we understand people are stupid. So if for whatever reason one of us is willing to or about to cheat on the other we make sure we break up with each other first. That way even if it ends badly we will not have to add another cheating EX to our background. 

Last year I got a new job. And a new girl came. To make a long story short she has a very nice personality, cute, ..... and kinda a flirt. Not to mention she has a boyfriend. We?ve been friends for months now and I finally told her how I felt. Not in a attempt to win her over, but in a sad notion to help me stay on track. We both agreed while she did love me also the feelings were just not the same. 

Me and the girl are close friends and we talk about everything even the  bad parts in our relationships, her more so then me. I?ve tried to take precautions for things not to advance in the wrong direction. But I still find myself staring at her and wanting to be around her every chance I get. Her boyfriend and me get along nicely, but I?m not sure she has told him. 

At times she says things to me that make it feel like she wants me or at least has thought about it.

Last night felt like the last straw. I had a dream which was rated ?A? for adult. The first one and waking up to it drove me crazy now that?s all I?ve been thinking about.

718,Lokpmpiko,[new],11,c694el,3,"I never want children and I want to be a professional artist. I want to date someone who is the same in these two aspects. I know that makes my dating pool pretty small, am I being unrealistic?

Here?s my rational for my preferences:

* Childfree: I think this is pretty much a must, we wouldn?t be compatible with what we want in life otherwise. I wouldn?t even date a guy who is on the fence, I?ve heard too many horror stories about a relationship ending because one partner wasn?t serious about being childfree and thought the other would change their mind.

* Artist: Okay this one I know is pretty out there and arbitrarily limits possible partners, but art is my passion and I want someone who I?ll be sharing my life with to also be an artist. My sibling is an artist, most of my friends are artists, to me it?s an important thing to have in common. I don?t even want someone who casually draws or treats it as a hobby, I draw for 5+ hours a day and it?s something I take seriously. If they draw but they draw badly that is a huge turn off.

If it was just one of these things I wanted I wouldn?t be worried about finding someone, I know a lot of CF couples and artist couples, but CF and artist together is just so specific I don?t know how I?ll ever find someone. Of course even if I met a guy exactly like that which is unlikely, they might not be interested in me or our personalities may not be compatible in other ways so I feel very hopeless. I?ve never been in a serious relationship and I have turned people down because they did not fit these. 

I?m not picky about other things. I?m average looking myself, I don?t care about height or appearances that much as long as they are not overweight and take care of themselves. I don?t care how much money they make, I?m interested in artists so obviously they?re likely on the lower side of income, as long as they are frugal with their spending habits.

719,StonerOrca,[new],10,c6945b,3,"TLDR: been with boyfriend for 5 months, known him for 2 years. He wants us to live together during the next school year, but I think it?s a horrible idea, as he has no job and I prefer to have some independence. 

Okay so 2 years ago I came to Europe to study abroad, I?m originally from the USA. I met a guy, Ryan and we hit it off immediately. Unfortunately when I returned to the USA we broke up, but not because of indifference, because of the distance. 
After graduating college I found a job in the same city and immediately came back. We have been together 5 months, so I guess that makes us together in total for about 7 months in a 2 year period. 
I love him, we go great together and we?re both super happy. 
Since I?m a teacher, I don?t have a job during the summer and am working as an au pair with free rent. Of course, for the next school year I need to find an apartment. 
Ryan lives with his parents, but yearns for independence from his family and to be seen as an adult, so a few months back he kind of hinted at wanting to live together in the next school year. I immediately thought it was a bad idea, but I have a list of pros and cons: 
Pros: 
Living with this guy would make me super happy
I wouldn?t have to live with a person I don?t know 
We can be as loud as we want, if you know what I?m saying.. 
Cons: 
He doesn?t currently have a job (but claims he could find one ASAP) however it?s a huge possibility that he would be short on rent some months and I would have to cover for him. 
He?s not reliable when he says he will pay me back for something. Too many times I?ve bought him things and he just doesn?t have his wallet and he never pays me back. 
When we?re together, I get literally nothing done, he?s a huge distraction. 
He eats my food as he pleases ( which I don?t have a problem with but if we lived together I think it would happen every single day) 
He has a ton of friends that like to hang out at night and that could keep me up at night. 
I need a ton of closet space and I don?t think I can share (lol but I?m srs) 
And of course, there?s always the possibility that we break up and cannot break the lease, and would either have to share a bed while being broken up OR one of us moves out and the other (most likely me as I have a nice paying job) would have to pay the full rent alone. 


Since he has been bringing it up a TON recently, I just am running out of things to tell him I don?t want to without making him sad. I can see in his eyes it?s something he really really wants and believes will happen. He?s even gone so far to send me links to apartments for rent and telling me ideas for how to decorate the apartment. 
If I end up doing this, it?s going to be a huge mistake and I know if I say yes to it, I am a huge chicken. I know I need to just grow a pair and tell him no, but I want to let him down gently.

He's from Italy and attending university here on a standard visa. Him and I have a lot in common since we're both studying in science fields and we have great conversation. He's extremely intelligent, caring, hardworking, and ambitious. I do love him and could see a future with him.

&#x200B;

At first, he never pressured me for marriage but did want to move in with me fairly quickly. Then his family started asking constantly about us getting married and around 6 months, he started asking me. I feel like this is partly due with his southern Italian culture and Albanian heritage. Because of this I feel he leans towards a more traditional outlook but this has never really bothered me. However, his family started to believe that I didn't really care about their son since I won't marry him yet.

I will be graduated by the end of the summer and then starting a full-time job. Currently, I'm in not position financially to move out out my dad's house and get married.

However, even if I was financially stable, I don't know if I'm mature and mentally ready for marriage either.

&#x200B;

I feel trapped. Today we got in an argument and he said when it comes down to it, I don't care about him because I would watch him leave and do nothing about it. Now he is saying if I don't commit to marriage he will leave next summer when he finishes school. He has been seeing an immigration lawyer but things have seemed to fall through. Part of me feels like if he really wanted to stay, he could get an employer to sponser him. I know that process is pretty complicated but he is a 4.0 computer science student and definitely capable of something. I feel like there has to be another way. Obviously he wants marriage for a greencard, but I do honestly feel he loves me deeply and wants a family with me. Has anybody been in a similar situation? What other things should I consider?  If I'm unsure if I want to marry him now, will I ever be sure? I understand why this would upset him, but am I an asshole for saying I'm not ready?

724,ptrwgg,[new],4,c68v7x,3,"My partner is really nice. Genuinely the most kind-hearted and well-intentioned person I've ever met. Her family is... not. I can't stand them. Her mom has been unemployed for years. She quit her last job because she said her coworkers were ""disrespecting"" her. She never got another job or ever tried to get another one. Just been living off her husband's disability and SS benefits + her children's wages. 

A few years ago, this ""mother"" went to her oldest daughter (30f) and started crying about how she has no money to support herself and how miserable she is and asks to use some of her credit cards to buy some things for herself. She maxes out the credit cards and leaves her oldest daughter with the debt. A few years later, she goes to her youngest daughter (my partner) with the same bullshit. My partner, being extremely sweet and loving, also handed over her credit cards. Now she's $10k in debt, struggling to make even the minimum payments because she recently lost her job and is now working at a lower paying job with fewer hours. 

Her sister, who has been the main breadwinner of the family for more than a decade, is understandably really cautious and wary about her money because she makes more than 3x  my partner's income. My partner has never asked her sister for financial help. In fact, she contributes a good chunk of her paycheck every month to help her sister with taking care of their mom. What's really irritating to me is that her sister is so suspicious even of my partner, who has done nothing to harm her, and interrogates my partner in order to find out her motivations whenever she asks for a favor. For example, she was furious that my partner asked if we could take some pads/tampons from their house while we were over for dinner because we had run out of pads/tampons at our apartment. Her sister went off about how my partner should be responsible for taking care of her own household and can't rely on her sister for everything. I was just... in shock. It's not like we aren't capable of buying our own pads/tampons or that we aren't capable of supporting ourselves. I know that my partner is struggling a bit financially but I make enough to support the both of us and I don't mind doing that. We just didn't really feel like  stopping at a store on the way home and thought it wouldn't be a big deal to just... ask for a few.  Honestly, I get why her sister is like this. I would hate to ever call her selfish. But there are just multiple instances of her belittling my partner by interrogating her about her intentions / her financial capabilities whenever she asks for a small favor like that.  

Her financial troubles we can handle. It's stressful sometimes, but nothing we can't handle. I just get pissed off sometimes that it's something we have to handle in the first place. 

It's already gotten to the point that I can't pretend to be friendly with her mom. I've gotten in trouble already with her mom because one time we went out to dinner and I didn't say hi. Her mom didn't talk to me for a month after that. Not that I really wanted to talk to her, but it upset my partner that her mom didn't like me. Now I'm getting so frustrated with her sister that I don't want to see her anymore either. It sucks because my partner loves them both so much. She sees both of their flaws but she's extremely family-oriented, especially since she lost her dad recently. I'm not looking to mend her family relations. That's not my place. I also won't tell her to go no contact with her family. That's her decision, and she has a lot of trauma from losing her dad, and I would never make her lose any more family. Emotional damage is way harder to deal with than any financial damage. However, just because I won't tell her to do anything doesn't mean I won't give her my input. Is going no contact something I should advocate for? Or should I just be more understanding? I don't want to overstep. I'm  usually pretty vocal about my opinions, but I know this needs to be more delicate.

When she caught me watching porn once as a teenager she yelled at me and told me it was disgusting.

This puts strain on my relationship as I'm with this amazing guy who's been patient for 2 1/2 years but I know he has needs and I want so badly to fill them as he always goes out of my way to take care of mine. I WANT to be better. I want to rid my mind of the beliefs my mom put onto me and have some of my own. I want to be this highly sexually active 22 year old woman, but I don't feel it and I so badly want to. I don't want to lose the guy I'm with because of some childhood shit I can't seem to shake off. 

Help? 

TL;DR : My Mom raised me to feel ashamed of sex & that's carried onto my adulthood. Now at 22 I have no desire to have sex as when I indulge I feel dirty, guilty & ashamed.

728,strangequarkkkk,Relationships,2,c68st4,4,"My post was removed before for not having a clear enough question so I will be more obvious: is this worth staying in and trying to fix our problems or should I just leave?

We?re 25F and 24M, we met in college and have been together for 5 years now.

He?s never liked PDA and has always wanted to keep our relationship fairly private (no pictures on social media etc) but in the beginning he was very affectionate and loving. That changed almost as soon as we moved in together. Now he says he only ever acted that way because he felt like that?s what I wanted from him.

He doesn?t like to tell me he loves me because he feels like once he?s said it once I should just know it. When I try to hug or kiss him, or cuddle with him on the couch when we?re watching TV, he stops me more often than not, and when I tell him I love him he gets annoyed because he thinks I say it too much and feels like he has to say it back (even when I tell him he doesn?t have to). I?m a pretty affectionate person and he tells me it?s too much for him, but I feel like I hold back a LOT.

We used to have an active sex life but it dropped off pretty quickly after we moved in together too. At first it was mutual, because we had roommates and didn?t want to bother them with nonstop sex, but when we moved out on our own it got a lot worse. He says now that he isn?t sure if he isn?t attracted to me or if he?s just depressed (he?s leaning towards the latter because he isn?t attracted to anyone else either). He also has mentioned being upset that I don?t dress up for him anymore, but when I do dress up he doesn?t notice or act any different than he normally does so I don?t really see the point. The last time we had sex was the first time we?d had it in a month, and afterwards I got really emotional and just wanted to cuddle with him. I don?t remember what I did but he started laughing because something I did was silly, and it hurt my feelings a lot so between that and his lack of interest I haven?t really wanted to have sex since.

We DO have a really strong friendship and connect really well on an intellectual/companionship level, and I really really value that, but I?m starting to feel like I want more from a relationship and he doesn?t. The reason I put boyfriend/fianc? in the title is that we?ve technically been engaged for several years now, but we keep having to put off the wedding for a lot of different reasons, many of which boil down to the fact that he doesn?t feel ready. He mentioned recently that he knows I would be down to get married tomorrow, but he isn?t. The main reason he isn?t sure is that I?m not as neat or clean as he would like me to be. Admittedly I?ve slacked in this area - in part because I felt like I was putting a lot of work in to be what he wanted and not getting the same effort back - but recently I?ve been putting a lot of effort into trying to improve. However, recently we were working through a couples therapy book and were told to tell each other something we appreciate about the other. It took him a LONG time to come up with something I?ve done that he appreciates, because in his words ?I?m an acts of service person, and you never clean the whole house without me asking or anything like that?. This came right after I spent an entire day and a half helping him clean the house for his mom to visit us. He did eventually say he appreciates that I keep him from getting too down on himself but it took him a long time.

I do think he cares about me and my well-being and gives me a lot of emotional support. We?ve talked about most of the issues in this post and he knows he?s very aloof and says he wants to work on it, and to a degree he has, but it?s clearly a huge effort for him. He also thinks my level of attachment to him is unhealthy, and I?m starting to think he might be right. I?m unsure what to do because part of me wants to stay a while longer and try to work on it and see if things get better, but part of me feels like he?s telling me very loudly that he doesn?t want to be with me and just hasn?t admitted it to me or himself yet. I just don?t know how much longer I should keep working on things with him and how much is normal to expect after 5 years. It?s also both of our first relationship so we have nothing to compare this to.

729,throwthephoneawaypls,[new],27,c68qrg,9,"This is going to be long, apologies in advance.

Some brief context: From 2014-the beginning of 2016, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. She was violently verbally abusive, and consistently accused me of cheating (I'm not that kind of person), and would tell me to kill myself over it, while cheating on me several times and gaslighting me into thinking it was my mental illness talking. Since then I avoided relationships altogether and stuck to meaningless hookups and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Until I met K.

&#x200B;

K and I met in January of this year, and by mid-February she wanted us to be exclusive. Since then, she's been amazing. When I told her I'm bipolar, she started reading up on resources, she's been incredibly supportive as I've gone through two deaths in the family, and had to deal with several hardships this year. She's a complete 180 from my abuser. We love each other, we always have a great time together, everything feels great.

&#x200B;

Back in April, she had told me about her personal trainer (I used to be a trainer), and she told me some things that concerned me in terms of professional boundaries. He would send her multi-paragraph texts when he pushed her too hard, saying he was sorry, and that he really cared about her (this is what she told me about the texts), would post multiple videos of her workouts to his story, many focused on her butt, while every other client only got one video. He also referred to me as ""cool guy"" to her, even long after we were official, which is generally something men do to demean other men.

&#x200B;

Given our work schedules, we only see each other a couple times a week. At this point in the relationship, she had bailed on our plans last minute a few times. One day, she had the day off, and told me she was going to see her trainer speak at a networking event, and it would be done at 1, then she'd head over. At 3 she said the event was still going, but it would be over soon. At 6 she said it ended up being an all-day thing, and that she'd be heading over soon. The post on Facebook for the event said it was only from 11-1:30. 

&#x200B;

When I mentioned this, and that his crossing of boundaries made me uncomfortable, she said ""I don't appreciate that you're insinuating there's something between us"" which I wasn't. Just that it was hurtful that this guy was important enough to go to this conference, but she couldn't text me to tell me it was an all-day thing. When I mentioned the time, she said ""I don't know what to tell you, people were speaking the whole time."" We fought the next day, to the point of her screaming at me, and then didn't talk to me for two days.

&#x200B;

This was hard, and I tried to stomach it. She flew with me to my hometown in May to support me during my grandparents' celebration of life, and met my whole family. That meant a lot to me. When we got back, I couldn't shake this feeling, and I know it's wrong and I hate that I did it, but I looked through her phone. I found a few things:

&#x200B;

\* She had been talking to her abusive ex of five years. She later told me, through another conversation, that she had texted him through the beginning of March, but just during wrestling matches. In the texts that was mostly true, but there was one instance of mild flirting. The harder part was that she ran a marathon in February, and she gave him her runner ID so he could follow along and support her. She didn't give that to me, and told a friend that she was mad at me for not being supportive. I have no idea what I was doing wrong, and she never told me I had done anything wrong. She posted a picture of us together on Instagram on April 26, and he immediately blocked her. She tried texting him at the beginning of May, but he didn't respond. I know letting go of an abuser is hard, I've been there, and I'm trying to empathize.

\* Her trainer had texted her to say ""Please don't respond to that long text"" which she had deleted. He also said ""I wuv you! (J-not like that)"" which, fine, whatever, but also gross. 

\* The night that we fought, the day she went to her trainer's thing, she got a text from a guy who said ""Much love for the vibes"" and sent her a picture of her at dinner. She had also deleted a picture from that day of him taking a selfie on her phone, from her house. He also said that when he left he was a bit tipsy. Nothing flirty on her end, but she never mentioned any of this to me.

&#x200B;

None of this is directly cheating, and I know if I confronted her she'd be livid for invading her privacy. Rightfully so, but those things are concerning. I don't want to mention it because they could all be fairly innocuous, and what we have outside of that is really good. She's been there for me in ways no other partner has, and I haven't felt this strongly about someone before. The vulnerability is scary, but she's done a lot to assure me I'm safe with her. I'm just not sure how to shake this.

&#x200B;

I have a therapy session tonight and I plan on talking to my therapist about it, but my anxiety right now is getting to me, and I'm not sure what to do.

730,LowlyCultist,[new],10,c68pqv,5,"We were both 23/24 and in college. We shared some friends and social groups, and got together to play D&D on a weekly basis for almost two years. I'm not sure when my feelings for him changed, but eventually it was any room he walked into just lit up, and every time I got to hang out with him, and talk about shared interests, it gave me the energy to get through my day. I found myself thinking about him way more than a friend should.

The problem is, I never told him any of this. I was in a bad place mentally and emotionally, and was just starting the long road to recovery from depression. Additionally, I had no indication that he identified as gay or bi, that my feelings could even possibly be returned. I was afraid he would be disgusted, that we wouldn't be able to put things back to the way they were. The status quo continued until some time in my third or fourth year of college, at which point, he simply dropped off the map. He stopped coming to class, he stopped taking my calls (or those of our mutual friends). I kept a brave face on, but privately I was devastated.

A year later, I saw him again, but he looked like he hadn't been taking care of himself. He didn't smile as easily, and he didn't come to hang out with our friends at all. We just sort of stopped seeing each other. After we'd both left college, I caught up with him almost three years later on Facebook. I found out he was living in Arizona (we had previously been in Minnesota, he was from Wisconsin) and had been doing much better. We sort of naturally stopped talking after a while.

Even now I still find myself thinking of him. Would it be wrong to send him a message confessing to all this? Would it be unfair of me to tell him? I feel like some part of me is always going to think of him, some part is always going to hesitate when I meet somebody new, because I never had my feelings resolved. I just want him to know, and at worst become an awkward story he can tell. At least I'll know it could never have worked out.

734,VastBarracuda5,Relationships,124,c68hsw,84,"Me (29M) and my new fiance (25F) have been together for 7 years, and are planning to get married in a year.

We've always been a very strong couple, but we got an issue regarding whether or not I should have the freedom to get a tattoo. Which she doesn?t find attractive.

We've grown up differently, my parents have always been strict, but also very supportive of creativity and freedom. On the subject of tattoos, my father had a rule ""No piercings or tattoos while living under my roof."" I've always been cool with that, I basically left home for college and career at 18 and still never got one. Instead, I waited for the right idea to come, spent years trying to find the right artist, and do the tattoo ""right"". I've always made this known to everybody, and never kept it a secret. This was 3-4 years ago.

During this, my fiance (GF at the time) had MAJOR issues with this. She doesn?t find the attractive.

Throughout that entire process, I tried my DAMNDEST to explain to her the ""self-importance"" of doing this for myself alone.

She didn't see it this way... I told her I cared about her opinions and views, but in the end this is something of importance to me. I can sympathize? but I also hold my values.

Anyways through all of that buildup, I got that original tattoo years ago. She couldn't look at it for a while. But we worked through it, and she still finds me attractive. I know she doesn't love the tattoo on my shoulder, but she isn't disgusted by me.

So between then and now, I had mentioned to her i'd like to get another. To which she would roll her eyes and give me a lighthearted ""ugh, where this time."" I kept transparency with her on placement, design idea, and have never been secretive. I found a new artist, and want to get another piece on the inside of my bicep, nothing vulgar or trashy. I asked her if she'd want to accompany me this time, and worked to book the appointment on a schedule where it worked for both of us.

But now I'm a week out and this is starting to blow up again. And back to the root of the problem on her end ""I don't respect her opinion or I wouldn't do it."" We've had extremely long conversations where I?ve gotten emotional and sad and explaining the importance of being able to have certain life freedoms, I think all people should have. I want more than anything for her to understand where I'm coming from and to trust in me.

She's mentioned we're about to get married, and it's not just about me anymore, we're a unit.

She says ""don't say you care, because between a tattoo and my feelings, you pick the tattoo"" and I feel like that?s not fair and missing the point of this whole thing.

I don't know how I can mend or help this scenario, without compromising my deeper-rooted belief that I should be allowed to have freedom for personal self-expression.

&#x200B;

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I was seeing her for about 6 months before I moved across the country. I was a jerk but they liked me for some reason and I was weird because I was about to leave and move away. A month after I left they visited me and asked me if I wanted to try to date. I knew I had feelings for her but I wasn't sure if it was because I was just lonely in a new place or if it was real and I didn't want to end up hurting her, so I said no.

This was like 10 months ago and we are still good friends but I was never able to stop thinking about her. Even when I try to meet new people I compare them to her. Recently I tried to stop thinking about my feelings and just like \~feel\~ them and it was devastating because it turns out I'm like horribly in love with her. I'm visiting home soon and I really don't want to be weird, because I know I'll just want to tell them the whole time. SO what I tried to do was send them a letter about how I love them and how I shouldn't have moved and should have said yes back in October blablabla but it never reached her. Maybe this is like fate telling me I shouldn't do it, maybe mail just doesn't work, or maybe the postal office confiscated it for the delivery of biological material (a little exoskeleton).

&#x200B;

The letter itself is rude I think, because I am like 2,000 miles away and she even started seeing someone else, but at least then I would have been able to stop thinking about it. To make things even more confusing they might have stopped seeing this other person (but it is too soon to say) and I go back in one week now. When we lived in the same city she was always so nervous and I was always so ambivalent but now I'm not ambivalent and it is way too late, but when we hang out it's probably going to be the only thing I can think about (which is why I wanted to tell her via letter a few weeks ago so it wouldn't be weird).

This school is huge and people mostly don't know each other. I know a few guys from her class and from what I can gather she hasn't integrated too much and mostly stays within a few friends.

Since yesterday someone took a picture of her kind of absently sucking her thumb during class and they've been passing it around and mocking her in the hallways. Today we were in the cafeteria and a guy from my group mocked her for it in front of me and I told him to shut the fuck up. He got all mad at me and kept walking while insulting me too.

After school was done I had to stay for practice but tried to talk to her about. I said ""listen, about this thing..."" and she got angry and said ""what do you care?!"". I was very confused and asked her why she got angry all of the sudden and she said ""whatever"" and left me behind.

So, that was that.

Sucking her thumb is something she has done since forever as far as I remember. She's been mocked before about it by cousins and even an uncle said something not nice about it some time ago.

745,relationshipadv2019,[new],2,c67pqm,0,"On Monday, I broke up with my boyfriend. He?s a great guy and I really do care about him, but after spending a week away from him last week a few frustrations have kept me from missing him. I wanna be good friends with him because we are similar people and have a lot in common and a lot of hobbies together. The reason I told him I didn?t want to try again is because I didn?t want to hurt him. He cried a lot and told me that he wants me to give me time to improve on these things. I told him I don?t want to hurt him any more because Im not sure it can be fixed.

The next day, we hung out on my request and I realized I do still have a lot of feelings for him. We have so much fun with each other and seeing him with someone else would destroy me. I?m starting to think it was a mistake and he deserves more time. 

And honestly, a lot of the problems are maybe not irreparable. He doesn?t offer to help with things very often. He rarely offers to cook for me, or offer to clean up when I do. He hasn?t seen his friends a lot since we started dating. I don?t feel like he?s clear with me about his goals for the future, which is important since we?re about to be seniors in college. After talking again yesterday. I know these are things that I never brought up to him, and I could tell in his voice that these are things he honestly wants to improve if I give him another chance. He also wants to regain romance and go on more dates together, which I?m now realizing we didn?t have a lot of alone time the last few weeks we saw each other. The thing is I don?t know if I should believe him, or if it?s just my emotions getting in the way and wanting to. I believe he can improve himself and mature. 

The guilt I?m feeling is because we never talked about these things and I never gave him a chance to improve, which I?m very torn whether or not I should do. I?m worried that after our honeymoon phase I started to notice problems and flaws, but I didn?t vocalize them and actually try to improve them, if they can be improved.

I talked to my friends and family a lot about this, but now I?m realizing that a couple of my friends who know him a little bit better than others pressured me into it and that upsets me. One of my friends, call her J, lives with me and she?s noticed a lot of these problems. L and B have too. The thing is I?m almost upset with them about how much they pressured me, especially considering how immature they are with relationships. J has never had a boyfriend, B had a very one sided and unhealthy relationship for over a year with a really nice guy she didn?t care about, although she was the least pressuring to me, and L is in a 3 year long distance relationship that she is extremely unhappy in and talks about ending almost every day. Not to mention L has told another friend of ours that she gets angry when she sees me and my boyfriend together because of how much she misses hers, her personal issues with him make me trust her opinion less.

So now, I just want advice. I?m heavily leaning toward getting back together with him. Should I give him more time because I didn?t before? Is this just miscommunication about minor problems in our relationship? Or will it just inevitably hurt us even more? How should we approach just being friends if that?s the case?

I am in a BDSM relationship with a nice girl who I've been seeing about a month and a half. She wants more I think but I am laying firmly that I don't want to date and am much more here for sex. I don't emphasise that fact enough and I feel bad for not wanting more. 

So I've seen this girl for about  a month and a half after meeting on tinder. On the first date we had sex. And have slept together about 3 times in total. We have a BDSM thing going where she sends me nudes etc when we don't see eachother. But I think she is starting to really like me and I go along with the whole BDSM thing but am worried she's looking for more. I made it clear I don't want to call us boyfriend/girlfriend and am not looking for a relationship. 

We had a discussion and I made it clear I like her alot but don't think we'd work in a relationship (which we wouldn't. Totally different people). 

I don't want to break it off with her as I'm enjoying myself and she is too. But I think she's getting very invested and I don't know how to fix that. I don't want to hurt her but I also know I'm not going to be the one she dates for a long time.

This is my first relationship which I till date believe will last forever. My girlfriend has previously had two relationships which kind of traumatized her as both the boys ditched her, broke her trust.

Initially she told me that she wanted to be in a relationship which she would like to turn into marriage. And throughout these 2 and a half years we have faught a lot but have always found solutions to the issues we faced. I have always been the one who expresses more love. She expresses her feelings occasionally. She always tells me that due to the previous happenings she suppresses what she feel for me. Sometimes She even refuses to accept that she loves me. Deep inside myself I have developed a faith. And I now know that she is like coconut, soft from within but hard from outside. With time I have learnt that we have to be patient while handling people with broken heart. I understand that all the harsh lessons from life have made her like that. 

Now, we are in a Long Distance Relation and she has started backing off. She says LDRs never work. This time she is not talking with me from past few days.

The major difference is that all the previous fights (which could have arisen while calling/texting) were solved when we met in person. But this time she is not even picking my phone calls and is not responding to my texts. But at the same time when I am commenting on her Instagram Pictures to display love publicly, she is replying to those comments with more love than that is in my comments. She is not telling me what has happened. I don't know what is wrong.

TL;DR My Girlfriend is not talking with me from past few days. She is behaving strange since we got into Long Distance after 2 and a half year normal relation. She is not replying to my calls/texts (ignoring).

AITA here for not knowing what has caused this?

I am in this dilemma if I should try to work out this relationship or what?

It?s been two weeks since he blocked me everywhere. I dreamed about him seeing a new girl. The first date me and him had was two years ago and he always told me it was so special and he can recount and have recounted to me the details of that date minutely anywhere anytime even after two years. I don?t think I can find someone who made me feel this right. If I didn?t fly there and at least try, I?d regret it later on in life. He told me when he found out I contacted his friend against his wish, he didn?t love me anymore and it turned into disappointment and anger. I?ve been working these days. When it?s all finished, I might go. I?m not sure whether this effort would be considered idiotic.. If he shoots me down or he is not home for holidays (he told me the plan before) then it?s fate. I?m also starting to go therapy sessions soon and going to be a high school teacher this Sept. So if I fail miserably in relationships, I feel somewhat hopeful in other aspects of life. Not everyone will be lucky enough to end up being in good relationships. Right? All my friends think he was a bad match but at least he tried to be a good bf. At this point, I just want to be able to tell my older self that ?at least I tried? 

Thanks for reading this. My bf Michael and I knew each other 2 years ago and remained friends after it. He?d occasionally chat with me about his dating life etc. He had slept with 50 people prior to us being seriously together. Last October, 2018. He moved to my country, but another city. He asked me to travel with him . I did. And I lost my virginity to him then. After the trip, he went back to his city, which was 2000km away from mine and our long-d began. But I was always quite unsure about him since I hated his glorious sex history and I was a complete blank paper on that. In November, he told me he loves me. Nov. 16.2018 My dad beat me hard till my nose was crooked and had bruises all over my body and legs (my dad was always abusive and a bipolar) and immediately after that my bf asked to travel with me again. And I was crushed by the abuse and wanted to have some fun so I met him as a second date. December, he flew back to his home country to celebrate X-mas and was quite out of reach for a couple of days and we broke up for one week during the first week of January,2019.  I talked to him and he went back to me. We asked about whether each other had done sth fishy during that week of breaking up. He said no. HOWEVER, during Feb, when he flew to my city to see me and we were planning to visit Adelaide as a trip together. I played with his phone in front of him and saw his messages to two girls, one is Anna and the other is Alice. The girl Alice asked him on 26/11 to travel with her to Adelaide in the same time slots and he replied. There?re several rounds of them discussing the travel plans. However, on 27/11 he told her that he was in love with someone else (me) so he couldn?t go. 
The twist was only after March, I found out Alice was waiting on his porch during the January one-week breakup for two nights. And he let her in and let her sleep on his bed since he had only one room rented. But he promised me that they didn?t do anything sexual at all during that two nights. The fact that he concealed this from me and that knowledge of what happened really destroyed me.  On that same day when I scrolled down his message history, I found out another thing that grossed me out. He texted Anna three sentences to describe me ?She was rich. She had sexy body. She wanted to have sex with me.? I was deeply offended. About the riches, in fact he paid for most outings. But regardless. After I flew to his city and found out about the exact time period when Alice slept in his room. I lost it and  I CHEATED on him for revenge. The guy I cheated on him with was my ex, Ryan, who I dated for three years but had no sexual contact in any way with. Ryan was very prudent and a virgin. So Ryan was clean. During the affair, he was too inexperienced and the condom got broken. So I had to take after-pill. But I found myself bleeding out of period severely after it. So I had to go to the hospital to get checked. One day after my affair, I leveled with my ex Michael about it. He took me back. It was in the early May,2019. When the result came out, i was diagnosed with hpv infections with high-risk strands, 18 and some other low-risk strands too. Michael was very concerned and wanted to move to my city immediately to take care of me. He even gave me the money for rent so that I could find a place for him to stay. He also told his boss and work colleagues  about sudden leave. 

On 16, May,2019. It was my birthday, he flew to my city and took me to one of the best restaurants as a treat. However, he started to talk about his teen life as a bar-tender in a nightclub and I was suddenly offended cos at that time i was still bleeding a lot due to infection and his past was the reason for me to suffer. So I was angry at him and argued with him. We left abruptly without even having the birthday cake for me as a dessert. He decided to break up with me again on the spot. He blocked my number and everywhere. Yet two days later, I called him with my mom?s phone number, he took me back but he said he didn?t want to talk for a month and that was the minimum cost of my immaturity that night. He did sacrifice a lot by taking a 22-hr slow train to my city and on the last night, he had to sleep only for 2 hours after the birthday dinner to catch up the early flight and had a whole day work immediately after. 

After that, it was the final-exam month for me. I was still bleeding on a daily basis. And we weren?t talking as much. But I knew he was still committed to me and in love with me. However, one week before my exam took place, he called me that he was going to a city where Anna lived, the girl he trashed me with. Also, Anna was a friend of his former hook-ups and she met Michael in a club. He always wanted to travel to that city and he said Anna has a boyfriend and I was just being silly. He stayed in that city for a week and he told me he planned to see Anna for only a day and he was catching the flight to leave on the night of that day. That girl left comments on his Facebook like ?I love ya mate and I miss ya.? Even though at that time, his profile picture was a photo of me and him. And he replied ?i miss you too? I was upset. Cos I wouldn?t say I miss you to a male friend. 

When I knew he was somewhat excited to see Anna, I lost it and I contacted the girlfriend of his best friend back in Perth, Sara, to tell her everything about my hpv infection. Sara heard about me but hadn?t met me at that point and she thought I was crazy. 
Michael was informed of this by Sara immediately and he told me he?s done with me. Cos he did tell me not to contact his exs or his family about my infection. I thought a girlfriend of a best mate was different. So before the day he met Anna up, he changed the Facebook profile. In the hindsight, I recalled when I found out him bad-mouthing me with Anna in Nov, I told him to delete her, to choose one. He met Anna after me actually, and Anna was just one of the clubbing girls. I met him when he was traveling. I am still very angry why a person would value some random people met from clubs this much. Also, he said he was uncomfortable with sharing his phone password with me. But he said I could check it in his presence. But actually I never wielded that power after these mindless discoveries for fear of more disappointments. Does he just need validation from women as much as possible? And I was actually more attractive than that girl from China. 

During our 8-month long distance relationship, there were three times (including the one with Anna in the end) he went to see his female friends one on one. But he sent me his work schedule every week. He called me for hours every night. And always let me know where he was. I was pretty certain that he was loyal. He also promised me after the fishy messages that whenever he talked to girls proactively, he?d let me know. And he wouldn?t make any new female friends from then on but he had to keep in touch with the old ones. (Most of them live in a different city than he does) I felt at ease about his commitment level. And he did spoil me by treating me and giving me nice presents and constantly making the effort to fly to my city to see me. Even after my diagnosis, he made the effort to try to end long distance when he knew sex would be off the table for a while. He said he?d be okay with sexless relationship in our situation as long as there was love and respect. He also told me that he wouldn?t want a messy open relationship in future. But I disrespected him to have ruined the birthday week and have contacted his friend against his wish. 

To him, I crossed the line three times. And I was out. To me, I don?t know how to view this relationship and how to digest this loss. Was my immaturity really accountable for this train wreck? My summer vacay is coming and I can fly to his city to see him. But is this guy really worth fighting for?

Starting a couple months ago my personality has changed. I know this sounds incredibly weird, but I don?t know how else to explain it. I barely recognize myself. I used to be a positive person, easy going and in general, happy. I loved being around people and people thought I was both fun and really pleasant. 

In the last couple months everything has changed and I don?t know what to do. I feel like I am ruining my relationships (both with my friends and with my partner) and hate the way I behave. I keep getting angry and hurting people. I make awful comments, have random angry bursts and get into fights. It?s awful. I can?t control myself. I know this sounds like an excuse for behaving poorly, but I truly feel I don?t have any control over my emotions. Sometimes I remember this events, others I remember something completely different from what happened and sometimes I don?t remember anything at all. 

For example. A couple days ago I was hanging out with my partner and some friends. What I remember is having a great time and going to bed. What actually happened is that I got into a huge fight with everyone, tried to kick everyone out of my house (including my boyfriend, who I live with) and then lock myself in the bedroom. 

I know the obvious answer is to go to therapy. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next month (it?s the earliest they could see me) but in the mean time I would love to get some advice. I keep apologizing to my partner and friends, but this happens quite often and I don?t want to keep hurting them. Also, I hate behaving this way. I know I am not person. But I don?t know how to change or what can I do. 

Any insights into why is this happening to me, how can I make it stop or how to manage my relationships until my appointment would be greatly appreciated

752,dadbeef1,Relationships,13,c67e8o,3," 

My (19m) relationship with my father (52m?) has never been great.

We have very little in common and I?m not even sure if I love, like or respect him. My parents divorced when I was about 6 and the arrangement was that we would see my dad on weekends every other week. This was because he was in the army so wasn?t always home. He left and has been out of the army for most of my life now however the original arrangement was never changed and was adhered to by my dad with what felt like a stubborn reluctance.

I didn?t used to have a problem going to my dads but as I got older, 11,12, I enjoyed going less and less because frankly it was just boring, we did very little and when we did do things it was the same old, like going to the park or going swimming. He didn?t like spending money on us (actually has gone a year without buying presents for me and 1 of my sisters on separate occasions) and even as a child the effect of that was felt. I knew pretty early on from pretty basic observation that he HATED having to pay child support and would be as difficult as possible about it to spite my mother. This was confirmed to me by my mother as I got older (she made it a point to never turn me against my dad and allow me to come to my own conclusions, my dad did not share the same ideals and frequently lied about and insulted my mother behind her back).

My mum had several arrangements with my dad, such as him taking us on holiday every year (he made significantly more money than my mum) and in return she would receive less money from him per month as child support. He did take us on holiday sometimes, but from what I can remember it was around 3 times? I did one year decline going on holiday with him because I was refusing to speak to him (when I was around 16). It?s not the holiday or the money itself that bothers me, it?s the lies and the principle of it. He?s told me often times he doesn?t have money to do things yet has been abroad countless times this year, and last, and had laser eye surgery paid for privately and is retiring at the age of 52.

Not only is my dad retiring, which I have no problem with, but he is moving to portugal, while my youngest sister is still in school and my oldest sister is just beginning college. The moving abroad I do have a problem with as it seems a blatant disregard for his children. I myself don?t have an issue with him moving as it doesn?t impact me, I no longer live full time in my hometown and I am attending university at the other end of the country, and I don?t particularly enjoy seeing/speaking to him so seems like a net positive for me. However, he did tell me and my sisters that if we wanted to visit we would have to pay for our own tickets.

I did not speak to my dad for a year or so around the age of 15/16 as he grabbed me by the throat because my sisters were (loudly) complaining about something I did. For the life of me I can?t remember but it wasn?t anything significant, I was probably just winding my sisters up in some way. I get that it was immature etc and, looking back, would have had no problem if he?d wanted to punish me, but I firmly believed at the time, as I do now, that his method was way out of line. He seemed to have more of a problem with them complaining rather than me actually doing anything and took it out on me. He never apologised but I?d decided to forgive him. During this time that we didn?t speak he made probably about 3 attempts to get back in contact with me (he lives a 2 minute drive away) and I was made to feel by members of his family that I was in the wrong because ?I?m the child and should be making the effort?. This was the time period in which he didn?t buy me Christmas presents or birthday presents, which I had no problem with, as I?d fully expected as much. However, my 2 teenage sisters who are, again, teeangers, put minimal effort in and rarely speak to my dad (for the past year or so I?ve made the effort to call him like once a week) and when he has explained his frustrations to me I explained to him that their behaviour is perfectly normal for teenage girls as they are way more concerned with their friends than they are with their dad. He has replied several times ?I don?t care, I?m their dad.? and has used the justification that ?they don?t bother with him so I wont bother with them? to not buy presents on a birthday or christmas. To me this seems like a cop out and he just wants an excuse. I?d understand perfectly if it wasn?t in the realm of possibility for him to not get presents due to financial constraints but as I?ve said, he?s retiring to a foreign country at the age of 52. He is not hurting for money.

I understand that money plays a large part in what I?ve talked about but I feel like I should reiterate. I care about the principle, not the money, my mum has significantly less money than my father yet she does her absolute best to provide what she can for everyone she can, whereas my dad has been late paying child support payments to spite my mother, knowing full well all it would do is mean my mum may have trouble paying bills, such as internet, TV, which she doesn?t really use, in turn impacting his children.

There?s also the fact that my father has repeatedly dismissed mental health problems in his children. My sister suffers from anxiety which has caused her to attempt suicide twice (that I know of) and miss a significant chunk of her education, which my dad has dismissed as her faking or lying. I myself was diagnosed with depression (I have told nobody this) and simply don?t want to tell my dad because he wont care or even bother trying to understand.

I feel an obligation to my father because he helped raise me, but, the more I think about it the less I can justify owing my father an obligation for putting the minimum legally required amount of effort in my upbringing. I recently visited him for fathers day and all I could think about the entire time is how much I wanted to shout at him for the way that he chooses to be. My mum has advised me that I might regret cutting him off, because he is my father. I believe at this point the only impact he can have on my life is financially and, out of principle I am not sure I would accept anything from him. I believe the emotional impact he can have on my life at this point is only negative. He is condescending towards me, frequently dismisses the profession I have chosen to pursue and shows little interest in my ambitions or general wellbeing. He did not contact me to offer condolences when my grandfather died and most recently refused to assist me in helping my mother deal with my sister, despite the major toll it was taking on me, simply because he was not willing to be civil with my mother. 

It feels wrong of me to want to cut him off because for the past year or so, we have been civil and talk regularly (probably the best our relationship has been in my lifetime) but I just cannot stand the way he chooses to act any longer and I feel it will take a continued toll on my mental health. Am I in the wrong for wanting to cut him off? Should I cut him off?

756,jaderade8448,[new],5,c66xxs,3,"*I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for any mistakes*

I'll start by giving a bit of background on the relationship. My boyfriend and I have been living together since we started dating 8 months ago. We knew each other through mutual friends for a year prior. I am now 5 months pregnant and we have made a lot of life changes together (also, the pregnancy was not unplanned or unwanted, and he initially asked me if I would like to try). We recently moved to Dallas from a small town in Louisiana. I graduated college and started my career. Our lives are almost entirely tied together besides marriage. 

Personally, I have always had problems with trust. This started with my parents, who did not give me or my sibling an ounce of trust from day one. I have been cheated on and lied to by boyfriends more times than I can count. Trust does not come easy for me.

At the beginning of our relationship, I gave my boyfriend my full trust. I didn't suspect anything of him. I didn't check in on him or snoop through his things. I didn't feel a need to for the first time.

He has lied to me about a few fairly harmless things since then, and each lie has made it more difficult to trust him. Since then, we have each looked through each other's phones (we don't keep locks on anything, even before our relationship). 

About a month ago, he was on his phone and a MeetMe email notification popped up. I asked him about this and he said it was just an ad, that he didn't have an account, and I believed him. Since then, he took that email app (Yahoo) off of his phone and only keeps his Gmail. 

He is logged into his Gmail on my laptop, so I took a look through his activity, which was mostly clean. But I saw that he had searched for both MeetMe (twice over a week) and Kik. He has told me in the past that he thinks Kik is only used for sexting. He had deleted the sites/apps from his history, but forgot to clear the search itself. 

Two days later, I asked him if he had been on any dating or hookup sites in the time that we have been together and he began by denying it, so I asked again. He said no. But, a minute later he said that he went on MeetMe to delete his account after he got that email (even though he previously denied having the account). I asked if that was the only time (since there were two searches a week apart), and he claims he only went on it that one time, to delete it. I also asked why he deleted his Yahoo account from his phone, and he said that he didn't know what else would pop up, so he wanted to remove it.

This is all I have been able to think about. I'm afraid that he is trying to ""hide a lie within the truth."" I can't get the thought out of my head that he is looking for affection from someone else. I want so badly to check his Yahoo to verify what he is saying because I can't bring myself to believe his story. I want to believe him, but I can't. I would need to use his phone to verify logging into his Yahoo account through text.

I know that I am also in the wrong for checking his activity, but I can't help but feel the need to protect myself. Being pregnant, away from family and friends, I feel more vulnerable than I ever have. I haven't been able to sleep and I can hardly eat.

I love this man with all of my heart. I so desperately want to be able to prove myself wrong. I wish that I didn't need to be proven wrong in order to trust him. I feel like even if he did get on this hookup site to talk to girls for a brief period of time, we would be able to work this out, but I know he would never admit this to me. I understand that people make mistakes and people want attention. I just need to know what happened so I can know how to feel and what steps to take.

My question is this: Should I risk hurting him by snooping in his email to find out the truth? Or is there a way that I can just let myself believe him without this eating me alive? Or, alternatively, should I ask him again and tell him that I know he has been on the site multiple times?

My boyfriend lost his mother just over a week ago. He was definitely what you could call a mama's boy, they had a close and loving relationship.

We've been living together for over 2 years and we're planning on spending the rest of our lives together. I am very close to his family, specifically his mother, who's told me many times that I'm a daughter to her. I really loved her a lot.

His mother was sick and on dialysis for the last year and a half. She's been in and out of the hospital for the last few months, mostly in. Finally there was nothing else to do and she was ready to go home on Hospice. We both stayed with her that night by her side, and watched her take her last breath in the morning.

My boyfriend was devastated, and my heart aches for him. Our relationship since has been ok, we've definitely had our issues over the years but I've pretty much put any issues we had before on the shelf for awhile, to work on after he's doing better emotionally. 

I have been doing the best I can to just be there when he needs me, and also give him space when he needs it. I helped him with the final arrangements. We finally buried her 2 days ago. 

It seems like he's gotten through the most intense part of the grief, for now... but going forward, what else should I do to support him in the coming weeks and months? of course I have a family myself, but my own mother was profoundly abusive and I haven't been a part of my family in over 10 years. When I lost my own father, nobody told me for 6 months and when I found out, I felt oddly detached like I was hearing about someone else's father... That's just what it's like when you have a family that isn't your family, I guess. I suppose I'm trying to say, I don't know what it's like to have a loving mother/child relationship and I just don't know what it's like to lose a real parent.

I?ve been with this guy for over four years now, we started dating my sophomore year of college/his freshman. I was a research aid for a professor and he would come around a lot because he volunteered in the fire department with that professor. We got to know each other and it happened. Now don?t get me wrong, things are going great and I could not be happier, I do see a future with this guy and it?s what I want. 

Growing up I?ve always had this fairy tale dream of having this amazing husband and this is honestly as close as it can get. Our relationship has been so great the last couple years, we get along so well. Every moment I?m with him I?m just so glad even when we?re mad at each other I?d still rather be with him. It was a learning curve for both of us, the first year and a half we didn?t really communicate too well. But we had this huge fight once, and I thought it we were coming to an end. We bought overreacted and said some things we didn?t mean. Afterwards though we sat down and apologized and decided how we?ll move on from there and how we can make sure future disagreements end much better. And it has been great, we still have fights but we instead attack the issue instead of each other and I don?t think we have been mad at each other for more than two days since. 

Things have just been so great, he?s a wonderful man, he treats me right, I love him so much and I know he feels the same way. As for our relationship, I can definitively see us being together for ever, we have talked about the future and our dreams don?t differ too much where someone has to give anything major up. It?s something we can both compromise on and be realistically happy. I have honestly not seen any red flags from the relationship. 

Anyways, he proposed to me last week and it was so romantic and sweet. I said yes obviously and I meant it at the time, but I?ve just been wondering if we will work. Like I don?t see any reason to believe that things won?t. He?s a phenomenal guy, and I think I?m a great girlfriend as well and things really do click. But everyone in my family has been divorced and that just scares me. 

My aunt divorced her husband two years after getting married, they seemed so happy and were dating almost eight years before hand. My parents divorced right after my last sibling moved out and they also seemed happy. In addition to so many other people. And that?s just what I?m scared of, a lot of people things seem great with them and they enter a marriage believing it will last forever and it doesn?t. I want to be with him for the rest of my life and I?m just scared if it doesn?t work out. I feel so bad for thinking that as well, he?s just a great guy and I honestly can?t really think of a reason why it wouldn?t. Obviously we have flaws but we manage to work through them and find something that benefits everyone, and this isn?t a show, we genuinely make each other happy and we make things work. I just don?t know why I?m so scared. I?ll obviously talk to him tonight when he gets home but I?d like so advise in the mean time.

759,SufficientEmployee,[new],9,c66r2k,0,"My boyfriend recently moved to another city and we have been fighting since he moved. He has a lot of issues that stem from his mother being emotionally manipulative and abusive. She treats him like a piece of crap, essentially. He's a nice person with a good heart, but when we get into an arguement, he treats me like his mother treats him, which is kind of poorly. Perhaps its because I'm really good to him. I have been so good to him and very understanding and supportive (this is according to my friends), I've even sent him money so that he isn't stressed out. 

One of our fights I noticed he went and liked a few girls pics and they were girls he met on tinder. I didn't want him to think I was keeping track or monitoring him, I just wanted to see his behavior after we fought. He later went and unliked the pictures he had initially liked. And when I spoke with him and in a general sense told him it's weird to me to have local women that he's matched on tinder still on his social media when he is in a relationship. He went and unfollowed those women. We have both been cheated on, so I try my best to make him feel as secure as possible. I even unfollowed a bunch of ppl since I'm in a monogamous relationship. 

Last night we fought but cleared everything up and were going to turn a new leaf for today. Since we had a fight, I went and looked to see if he liked any questionable pics and I saw that he liked a bunch of body shots with cleavage and selfies with cleavage.   This morning, I noticed that he followed a girl he told me he slept with and a few other girls from tinder. I messaged him this morning normally and noticed he went and unfollowed the girl he slept with, meaning he knew it was wrong to do.

I gave Bob my number and we hungout for the first time 2 days later. This was 6-7 weeks ago and we have hungout many times a week since, including 5 or 6 times where I spent the night. 

When we hangout we dont go straight to doing the deed. We always talk, have a drink, watch a movie and/or hangout with his roommates. We always have a great time and the sex is great too. 

But the situation is confusing because he is going for supervisor at our job. Because of this we have been very hush about us seeing each other. We barely talk at work minus saying hi or if were working in the same area. He has told 1 coworker that he trusts about us seeing each other where I haven't told anyone out of respect for him. He does not want to jeaprodize this opportunity as hes been working at it for a while and I understand and appreciate that which is why I've always been okay with being hush about it.

The issue I'm having is I'm catching feelings. I have spoke to him about it and Bob usually says something like ""it takes me a long time to know for certain if I like or want somebody long term"" or ""we need to wait and see what happens with the job"". What's really been bothering me with Bob is that he says if he does get the position then we will need to ""pause"" for a bit and it makes me upset because I will miss him but it being such a big moment for him I do understand. It is at the point of him most likely having his interview next week so it could be very soon we need to pause and he is already kind of in pause mode as hes so stressed over it. Bob tells me all the time how much he enjoys spending time with me and that we always have a good time together. Bob told me last night sometimes he feels something more for me and other times hes just not sure and I'm not sure if it just boils down to stress of the job or what it is.

Another thing is that we don't text very much. We do text daily but nothing lengthy. He leaves me on read alot. He told me right from the beginning of us seeing each other that he doesnt want to be stuck being dependent on texting someone as he just got out of a long term relationship and having to do that. When I ask him why he leaves me on read Bob says ""he is trying to prepare me a bit for when and if we do need to pause and give each other space"". 

Its just so confusing because of the work situation, but when were together we always have a great time. His actions when were together (cuddling, grabbing my hand, kissing me goodbye when I leave, etc) vs his words or lack there of when were not together make my mind go crazy with wonder. 

Like I said, when we are together it isn't just about the sex. Hes told me we wouldn't even need to have sex and wed still have a great time together and hed still want to see me. We really do just enjoy each other's company. His roommates like me, and that means alot to Bob, 

I have no clue what's really going through his head. 

Edited to add: its usually me asking him to hangout. Hes asked me a few times but alot of the time it is me. I would really like to see him this weekend especially if the interview is most likely next week. I brought it up yesterday and he said he wasnt sure. But I'd still like to see him. What do I do about that?

He invited me over after our shift last night, spent hours talking, having a couple drinks and listening to music and eventually had sex and passed out.
He was always asking if I'm okay and if I'm going to be okay, that he just wants to feel comfortable in the position before we continue seeing each other, that he will check up on me and see how I'm doing and that he basically doesn't want me thinking he just doesnt like me because of the pause. And he was reminding me aswell that theres a chance he wont even get the position so no pause would be needed, though I believe he will get it.

I suggested that we take a break for the summer as he was moving away for work, so he could figure out some things. He agreed but after that, we still spoke everyday and saw each other as much as we did before. I was clearly confused and soon began trying to get back together with him. His answer was always no, he was too overwhelmed. I was very understanding but asked him if it was because he wanted to see other people. He said no, he only wanted to be with me. After months of the same thing and essentially being partners, I was driving around my neighborhood and saw him at a restuarant on a date. I was shattered. I had done everything for him to make our relationship work and he had lied to me. I confronted him later and he began telling me all the things wrong with me and our relationship.. much of what he brought up was extremely easy behaviours to fix -- i could have solved the issues in a heartbeat if I had known he felt that way. He asked me to give him space, which I did. We are no longer talking but he has started a serious relationship with this girl, in only 2 months they have met each others families, been on trips and essentially moved in together. It is the hardest thing I have ever had to go through, losing not only my best friend and soulmate but also his family who was and still is like my family. I don't understand so much of what happened and I am trying not to feel guilt or self hate but it is hard when the person you trusted the most, choses to hurt you like this. My gut believes he will come back after this honeymoon stage of this rebound is over but I need to not get my hopes up because I don't know if I could ever trust him again and everything I see about them hurts more.

First thing, my best friend left the friendship group that we have been in together for 3 years this. Same as another two of my friends so now it remains only me and three of my friends. Friend Y[14F] and I have very minimal problems with but the other two and I have a very hot and cold relationship. Friend C [15F] doesn't understand when her jokes aren't funny anymore and are just annoying but she doesn't do it with ill intentions so I let it pass majority of the time. Friend T [14F] has always been very judgemental and closed minded but I thought we got past it until recently it's been showing severely. 

 My friend has got some toxic need for inclusion in everything. It's been happening since last year as I would sometimes meet up with friend Y without her and she would shit talk me for months about it. Friend Y and I spend a lot of time with each other as we live close to each other (about a 25-30 minute drive away from T and C) and take the same route home so sometimes it's more practical just to hang out with each other. We never shoved it in her face and we rarely did it but she would get mad about it. The funny thing was that she would meet up with friend C without us all the time and we never said anything. She even tried to organize a meet up without me and only Y and C. Y had told me that she asked to invite me but T was strongly against it. I never cared much but it did make me feel like a small part of the friendship group. It also happens when we have secrets. I get it feels crap to be left out when it comes to secrets but sometimes T justs needs to sit down and respect our decision not to tell her. 

Friend Y and I had noticed this trait and decided to pretend that we had some big secret that involved something after school. When we even slightly implied that something was going to happen, T started whining and complaining and throwing a huge fit cause ""she doesn't like being left out"". Yesterday she threw another fit which resulted in her being fairly violent when she found out C had a secret that both Y and I knew. This was something personal that we did not find out by her but by other people involved and C didn't want the topic to be a big thing so we all dropped it months ago. T wasn't happy that she wasn't involved and now we have to deal with that drama.

As for my family, my Dad yells at me when my energy level just aren't matching his or when I don't have it in me to partake in his fairly demanding activities. My Mum yells at me about my insecurities a lot. An example of this would be when I had told her I was suffering from trichotillomania (a hair pulling behavioral disorder to put it simply). This has been a very dark time in my life and one that is hard to open up about. I had been going through it for a few months at the time I told her. She responded by yelling at me and I cried for a while after that. She made me feel stupid and ungrateful for my hair. A few weeks later she found some of my hairs on the couch and yelled at me in front of my whole family (who I didn't tell), making me feel extremely embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I cried in the bathroom for about 5 hours after that as I have no other space in my house to call my own. 

This brings me to my next members, my sisters. My oldest sister [17F], M, is not causing me to feel anything negative besides when I compare myself to her but that isn't her fault. My second oldest sister [16F], K, is quite the opposite. She and I share a small room with bunk beds. We used to have a strong bond but our personality differences have become too much to bare so it's become harder to talk to her as I used to. She has started to become close to M, which I don't mind as they do seem to be more similar than me. The thing that bugs me is that she refuses to include me in anything. Even in a simple conversation. If I tried to join, she would just shut me out by saying things such as ""You don't know them"" ""Don't even pretend to know what we are talking about"" etc. M and I have a inside joke but whenever we talk about it, she seems to get angry about it. She has made it her life goal to make sure I know I'm the ugliest of us three sisters and it's working. I know I'm the ugliest but being told stings in a whole new level. M does help me with this though. I think she knows how I feel so she tries to make me feel better by saying things like how ""I've got and amazing body"" and that I ""look really pretty today"". I also have a younger brother [13M] but honestly he just plays PS4 all day. 

My family's favourite topic lately is my awful sleeping patterns. I think I have something like insomnia though I hate being one of those people of self diagnose. I don't sleep much and when I do sleep, it's usually during the day. Infact,  this is what triggered me to write this post. A few hours ago, I was actually falling asleep for once but K had barged in the room and turned the lights on. I had asked her to turn it off but she didn't and started being a smart ass. I have so much built up anger inside me so I eventually got out of bed and punched her. It's sounds bad but I couldn't hold it in. My mum of course yelled at me and didn't take into consideration that she had come in and made it hard for me to sleep. So here I am, at 12:40 am, wide awake. 

Like K, my friends also point out things I can't change such as my face, my families financial situation and my interests.

I don't even have any hobbies I enjoy anymore. I like singing but I don't compare to my sisters voices so I don't bother. I play guitar but I only do it to make up for my lack of singing talent. As I said before, I share a room with my sister so I don't have any space. My entire house feels like it's occupied and I never seem to have a place where I can just be alone. I need space from everyone but I have no where to go. I just want to be alone so bad. I crave space. The only thing I have is music, whether it be playing it or listening to it. The only time I feel okay is when I'm in the shower playing music because I actually have my space.

I don't think my family or friends understand what's going on in my head. I can't even explain how I feel but I can't keep hoping for things to get better. My self esteem is at its lowest. My energy and health are decreasing. My mind is giving in. Everything is just too hard to bare now (I'm not suicidal though). How do I get the space that I need? Does anyone else feel this way? Why do I feel this way? How do I deal with everyone?

Listen, I'm probably just being an over dramatic teenager but can someone at least tell me I am so that I can feel somewhat in peace with myself and not be worried anymore. 

[TL;DR: My friends and family are making me feel trapped and I just need some space. I don't enjoy their company most of the time but they aren't receiving the message that I can't handle them anymore. I have little to no interest in anything anymore and I may be suffering from trichotillomania and insomnia yet those who I have opened up to about this only make me feel worse.]",1561646192.0,My [15F] friends and family are becoming extremely insufferable and it's making me feel trapped.,1.0

I am being called for interviews in my country as well, but I haven't received offers so far.

Our sex life is very healthy, we are in good shape, money isn't an issue, we both have fulfilling careers, and we honestly just have a solid, non-fairytale relationship where we deal with things as they come and take good care of each other. 

I have never had a reason not to trust my husband until today.  Hell, we know each other's passwords, have each other's phone passcodes in case of emergency.  He was getting ready to leave for a work trip of a couple nights, and I opened his  work travel kit (a box with gear and accessories he needs for his job) to leave him a note, like we do for each other frequently, and right there it was: a box of condoms with two missing. I left the note away from them so he didn't think I knew.

I am absolutely floored.  I shut the box, broke down, and have avoided the subject.  He wondered why I was ""off"" this morning and was very concerned, but I managed to pull it together and say it was work stress.  But my mind is going nuts.

Would he be cheating when he's out of town for work?  I don't understand why. We have great, fun sex and plenty of it. I can't think of anything support-wise he's missing, he always seems happy and loves my family.  Not only that, the only times we've used condoms since like dates 2-3 is when we have an occasional threesome (see, he really has nothing to complain about in the bedroom, I'm bi and we occasionally have threesomes with a couple FWBs), and 1) he prefers a certain brand for fit, and 2) I checked that hidden stash, and nothing changed since we bought it last December and used 2.  These were definitely not that, and were a brand I don't think he'd ever buy unless he was in a hurry.

Me and BF have been together for 4 years, despite the distance and my illness. We always seen each other every other week at most, but today he told me that he will came to my place in three weeks instead of the usual two.
The reason is that he has to go to away with his ""friends"" on the ""scheduled day"", and he can't come this weekend because he has to do something I honestly didn't understand. He also justified that with the fact that I have to study, but this is the first time my studying is an issue.

I feel kind of rejected since we always did the scheduling in a particular way and suddenly this doesn't really work.
Also, another thing that makes me worried is that in late 2018 we were starting talking about going to live together, but in June he sort of backed off because he wants to live alone first and that I have to finish my degree first.

773,MaxLikeli,Dating,23,c65htp,6,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I don't know if the background helps. I got out of a long term relationship last year, it got very controlling and I was happy to be single and was in the process of reclaiming my life and my choices. After a month or so I met this guy on a dating app, that I quickly quit after exchanging info with him since I found him nice to talk to and good looking as well. I didn't want to clutter my life with more options as I was looking for something casual and this seemed right.

We met soon after and he was even better looking in person. I was looking forward to starting something casual some times in the future and I told him that in the first meeting, that i am looking for something casual. He made a joke that that's what he says to other girls, never thought he'd like somebody for the first time in a long time and hear this. Anyways, we have met 2-3 times after and things do get heated and I can't stress this enough that he is very attractive by all standards and I couldn't wait to have sex with him finally. Although I wasn't sure if I am ready yet, post break up and all that.

The last time we met was during a night out, I met his friends (lovely people) and I was slightly drunk so I slept over. We didn't have sex because I told him I don't want to do it drunk for the first time but we cuddled and such and I found out that i am slightly repulsed by him. If he gets sweaty. If I hold him. At this point I have NO IDEA WTF IS HAPPENING. Do I like him physically ? Yes. Do I want to have sex with him? No. The next morning we went for breakfast and I could sense that he really really wants to do it, so we came back and I gave in (YEAH i am an adult women who 'gave in', but I figured I am only skeptical because I broke off from a long term relationship, perhaps if I do it- the weirdness goes away). It didn't go away, the whole time we were doing it, I found zero pleasure in it. I couldn't wait for it to be over. As soon as it was over, I went like 2 feet away from him. He was slightly hurt by the 'not cuddling' and I said I just want to look at you (I feel so bad for lying). I came back after that. If I look at his pictures or think of him I can't help but be amazed at how good looking he is. Then what the fuck is happening? He is not a person I would like to date (very insecure, gets jealous easily even though I am very straightforward about everything) but he is good looking, and I would want to make it work with the sex thing. Does anyone have any insight to why this happens? I am very clueless. Is it person specific or perhaps I will feel this way with the next guy (whenever that is) too? What do I do?

  I?ve been with my new boyfriend for a few months now, and pretty quickly realized he eats a whole WHOLE lot. This combined with his complaints about his weight, and frequent bathroom trips made me start to wonder.

  One night we went out to dinner and I used the bathroom after him, only to see residue from the me he has just eaten in the bathroom sink. On other occasions he claimed he had eaten too much and wasn?t feeling well and would head for the bathroom. Finally, one night I was waiting for him to come back from the bathroom and when he kissed me he just reeked of vomit, so I flat out asked him if he throws up his food. He denied it, but several weeks later admitted to me that he was, in fact, bulimic and throws up after every single meal.

  He told me that no one else in his life had ever noticed(ex gfs family etc) and that if anything they just thought he sometimes ate too much and felt sick. Anyways, that was about 8 months ago and now we?ve had open conversations about his eating disorder. He gets very emotional when the topic comes up, and apparently this is something that?s been going on for about 5 years, but to be honest I?m not certain if he?s being truthful with me.
 
 I have tried giving him information about the permanent damage he is doing to his body. I?ve tried talking to him and being open and understanding, I?ve tried distracting him after meals to keep his mind off of purging. Nothing seems to help, and I realize that I have no concept of how he is feeling or how deeply seeded his struggle with this is. I love him very much and want to help him because I see how much he struggles with this every day. He is always asking if he looks fat, saying he hates himself and hates his body. 

  I just want to help him, but I feel like he is partially in denial. He?s told me the last time he visited the doctor/dentist they told him he is perfectly healthy but I know there are lifelong harmful affects caused by bulimia. His eating disorder is slowly robbing him of his life and it?s eroding our relationship as well as he is always more focused on himself/food/how he looks or feels more than anything else. 

 Can anyone please give me some advice here, I feel incredible guilty for not doing more as I?m the only one who knows about this? Is there any type of free help he can get as we?re not exactly in the position to afford professional counceling.

To date, this guy is the only person I cannot read for the life of me... I used to be a journalist, so I fancied myself good at that and getting people to loosen up, but he is very reserved... Hence the Reddit post...

Two and a half years ago, I met a guy and we hit it off -- so much in common! Nevertheless, we lived on different continents but kept in touch... a year later he moved to my city, but by that point I was dating someone and gearing up to move to my boyfriend's city (easy hour-long flight). I got cold feet about the move for a variety of reasons (including rocky relationship) but went through with it because I needed the job there... I avoided the guy for weeks but saw him a few times -- it was fun and nothing happened. The last time I would see him before leaving, it came time to leave the bar and he asked me to come home with him -- I was shocked, I seriously did not think he was interested and I didn't know how I missed it. Though I didn't break up with my bf for this guy, he definitely put some things in perspective and triggered it.

I came back to visit a couple times in the months following the move, slept with the guy both times... I stayed with him the first time but with a different friend the second time because it seemed like I crowded him a bit when he was there... We talked a bit after I stayed with him but didn't really chat in between my visits except for one phone call (my suggestion) that somehow became two hours of just talking. When we did text, he would ask when I was coming back... six months after I moved I had to tell him that I was actually visiting the following week, with my new boyfriend... it was a really awkward conversation.

Because of the history and my new bf's insecurity, I unfollowed the guy on Instagram (I don't use anything else) and the guy then unfollowed me. (I would have done it earlier, but I honestly didn't think about the guy after I met my new bf...) Fast forward nearly a year, and I've gone through a traumatic few months breaking up with the new bf (toxic relationship, shared flat) and being pushed out of my job... I hauled a_s and lined up my ducks to move back to my old city because I f_cking love my friends there and now have good career path there (thanks Brexit).

When I was interviewing in April, I contacted the guy, we started following each other on instagram again (neither of us follows many people and he regularly cleans who he follows/is following since he uses it professionally)... We met up for dinner and though he seemed into the idea in the time leading up to it, conversation felt a little strained... I know he was super busy around the time we met up e.g. he was running a bit late to dinner and had to be up early the next morning. Nothing else happened.

I contacted him a couple times since then about small stuff, but he didn't seem keen on engaging so I stopped and he hasn't initiated at all. He was never a big texter, but this feels outside the normal range and gives me a not-good feeling... I'm 95% sure he's single and has known I'm moving back -- I told him at dinner I got a verbal offer during my interview, though of course I said I was waiting until it was in writing to celebrate. Anyway, he still follows me on Instagram and saw the story I posted this morning announcing that I'm moving back next week. 

I'm getting some standoffish-ish vibes that would ordinarily make me turn my attention elsewhere, but I was fairly sure there at least *was* something there and I'm wondering if it's a defensive mechanism? I know I've been ""difficult"" with moving and boyfriends the whole time he has been here but it came down to bad timing and mutual LDR-aversion rather than just not having my act together...even so I wouldn't blame him for needing me to prove I'm serious since they were *my* circumstances. But I'm also not about to chase him if he's not interested... I am definitely serious about him, but I also know I need to take things slowly after all the upheaval... All evidence to the contrary, , I am not a relationship person and desperately need to recover from the last one (to quote a friend, I was bullied into it). My ideal at this point would be to be friends, without the expectation that we'll date now that we're both finally in the same city at the same time.

776,AardvarkCactus,Non-Romantic,11,c655np,26,"Sorry for the impending wall of text, but context is important. 

My brother has never been able to express appreciation for what family members or people he isn't close friends with do for or with him. With his close friends he has no problems being thoughtful, for example getting gifts, saying thank you, listening to their problems, spending time/keeping in touch with them etc. With me, our older brother (24M) and our parents (50sM and 50sF) he's usually pretty cold. It took until he was maybe 17 to start being able to say ""thank you"" (really deadpan as well) for things we would do for him. For example we went on some school trips together and I would share my food and allowance with him, and while he said thank you (at the time, a first for him), our classmates told both of us that they thought I was way too nice to him since he sounded demanding when asking for these favours. There are other examples from when we were in high school, like he would come into my room and hang out with me for hours, but I spent longer than 5 minutes in his he would start demanding that I leave and once literally dragged me out. 


Whenever someone in the family gives him a present that he hasn't explicitly asked for (like for a birthday), it's either a cold thank you or an immediate criticism. Speaking of presents, when he was 18 and I was 19, he asked me to get him a specific item for Christmas. It wasn't expensive but very difficult to find. I searched several stores for hours to get it. On Christmas he walked into my room, no greeting, and took his present from my bag. I told him I hoped he would enjoy it and he told me he actually wanted to give it to his best friend. I was jetlagged from the flight over so I didn't react but my mom was furious with him. I told my friends this story and they all said it was bizarre that he would do that. 


He once visited me (when I was 20) because he was feeling super down. I had to have dental surgery when he was over and it was painful and I bled a lot afterwards. I took a nap on my bed (which I was letting him sleep on while I slept on the floor) and woke up in my own blood. After I cleaned it he asked me to sleep on the floor because he was tired. While my face was swollen and still numb. He ended up sleeping on the floor because no way was I sleeping there with a messed up face. The next day we were eating lunch and he was doing something on whatsapp. I asked him what he was doing. He was muting everyone on whatsapp except for his best friend. First two people to be muted were me and my mother. I nearly cried, but said nothing because I was so shocked. I had just spent the past 3 or so days trying to be there for him and he just muted me and my parents (who paid for his flight to see me!). 


Anyways. Fast forward to now. We see each other about once or twice a month since he now lives nearby me. My parents live 8 hours ahead of us and really far away so we don't get to speak or see each other often. My younger brother is terrible at communicating over text or phone with us, giving one word replies to any questions (but he isn't the same with his friends at all). 


As a result when I do speak to my mom, she tells me things she wants my brother to know. For example that he should look for a part time job since he's never worked (this is a long story, but we lived in a foreign country with a study visa but not a work visa so even if we wanted to, no one would hire us), why won't he volunteer or work this summer?, etc. I agree with my mom that he should get some experience outside of his studies, but it's not my place to parent him or lecture him. I have suggested to him that he work or volunteer, and he has sat with me while I was looking at internship/volunteering opportunities , but he was totally disinterested. My mom brings this up every time we talk and insists I try to get through to him but I feel like I've done everything I can. I also feel like it's futile since he clearly doesn't appreciate me anyways. 

Seeing him is also another issue. He almost never initiates hanging out and when we do see each other, he always asks me if I'll pay for food (I did pay a few times but once I saw that he wouldn't reciprocate I started splitting the bill), and often criticises my appearance in some way even if my friends are with me. For example that I have visible dandruff (I have struggled with this for years, it never fully goes away), or that my nail polish is badly done, etc. My friends have been shocked when he does this and tell him that it's rude to say those things especially when other people are around. I have also told him I don't like those comments but he always says ""but you're my sister"". 

I'm not sure how to handle our relationship. I thought it would get better as we got older and while it has a bit, it's still too one sided for me. I like seeing him and I do enjoy his company, but I'm tired of being disappointed when he's unappreciative and I'm honestly also tired of my mom expecting me to say things on her behalf to him. Is there some way that I can just be friends with my brother? And how should I react when he's overtly rude to me?

Fast forward months , he moved to another department in the company and we ended up losing touch and stopped talking. I?d see him in the cafe each day and I?d notice him staring/watching me from afar. He seemed to always take lunch at the same time as me. From his actions I thought he seemed interested. 

Three months ago I found out I received an offer and promotion to work for the most reputed company in my field. It was an opportunity I couldn?t turn down. At this point,  I knew I?d be going (and had nothing to lose) so I messaged this guy (on our internal messaging system) to see if he?s like to briefly talk. To which he responded sure just check my diary and send me an invite, He?s in a slightly more senior position and is normally quite busy so I did and we caught up. 

It started out as general chit chat and at the beginning of the conversation he seemed disengaged. It was only after I said I?m leaving the company that he became fully attentive.

My friend is a very gentle person who finds it hard that the boys are fighting a lot and to set boundaries takes a lot of energy for her. Meanwhile, her partner is a lot more authoritarian and strict and critizises her ways. As does his parents... All in all, she struggles and has little support and receives a lot of critisism, ALSO for not ?making? her partner contribute more. For instance she is always up in the mornings as he wont get up, but if she is tired because of lack of sleep she gets told to ?relax more? or to make her partner get up. All responsibilities somehow fall on her. I feel that her partner and his parents are super unfair to her and I think she is a great parent, which I try to tell her regularly. I also try to say that she cannot control neither kids nor partner, since they are their own persons, and that a negative result (like a fight or kid meltdown) is not a reflection of her or her parenting. I mean a 3 year old will lose it sometimes, right? I think one of her problems is wanting to be able to control her environment (and I understand that the constant critisism does contribute to this wish - if I behave perfectly no one can critisize me etc). 

My problem with the situation is that I have become a venting mate. We used to talk a lot about things that both find interesting in general - lots of psychology and relationships, but more on a general note. Now she talks a lot about her struggles, but is striving towards unattainable goals. Wanting kids to ?directly do as told?, wanting partner to step up a lot more. I think her partner really should, be he is really a whole other chapter. She has brought things up to him many times, but he does not care. She cannot change him and to me she would be much better off leaving him. (which I have said). At some point I felt I only hear the same stories over and over and no wish for actual change. I am tired of listening to this degree, and would like to also spend time talking about other things, laughing together etc. She does apologize when she talks about it a lot so I know there is an awareness. I also want to be sensitive about it as I recognize that she needs support and someone who sees how amazing she is in order ti gather up the courage to make changes. It just feels like my comments fall on deaf ears and then we talk about her inlaws opinions as if they are much more important, and this honestly makes me feel less important and valued. I become someone to talk to, but my advice is not at all considered.

Are there good ways to positively engage in more fun/relaxing activities and topics, or do I need to adress this by bringing it up more straight on? I have given advice and expressed my opinions at times, but have not straight out said that is becomes too much for me to listen to.

779,househuntingwoes,[new],34,c650wm,3,"So let me preface this by saying I know this isn't as dramatic or juicy as a lot of posts here but it's something I'd like to get some advice on nevertheless. This is my boyfriend and my first real argument and I'm not sure where to find the middle ground.

So boyfriend and I are house hunting. We've seen a few already, and are scheduled to view a few more. We've been looking at new places every day and while there's not a ton on the market right now (sellers market in our area, with some houses selling within days of being listed) we're finding enough that we are able to schedule about 4 or 5 viewings a week.

The issue is that my boyfriend keeps going over budget with what he's looking at, which came to a head last night when he wanted to schedule a viewing to see a place that was 15k over our **max** budget. The place was just listed a couple days ago.

His side:

* We're going to be in the area to view another place anyway so there's no harm in going.
* It might go down in price over time.
* We could offer less to bring it in budget.

My side:

* It was **just** listed on a hot market so they're not going to accept less at the moment, when loads of places are going for more than asking.
* If it stays on the market and they lower the price we can view at that time.
* I don't want to go down a rabbit-hole where we start looking at houses we can't afford just because they're there when we're finding more than enough that we like and are actually in our budget.
* We've found loads, including one we viewed and both loved, that are **under** budget - we don't need to spend every last cent of what we can afford on a place.

We argued back and forth last night until I eventually told him if it mattered that much to him then to just set up the viewing, but I've expressed how I felt about the situation. He tried arguing more and I said I had nothing new to add to the conversation, that I'd already told him how I felt about it. He went off and played games/watched sports for the rest of the night, we didn't talk again. 

My boyfriend is **very** good with his finances so I don't want to make him sound completely impulsive. Financially he's in a much better place than I am and he just in general has his shit together. But I really don't want to be spending my time considering places that are too expensive; I don't wander through a random person's house knowing that it's not realistically going to be one we're going to buy.

So I guess the question is, how do we navigate this? Especially knowing it'll likely be something that continues to crop up in one fashion or another. Any advice would be appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend and I are house hunting, he wants to view a place that's over our budget, I feel like it's a waste of time to view something we can't afford. What do?",1561639171.0,I (30F) am house hunting with my boyfriend (34M) and budget is causing friction.,0.83

I am waiting for blood work to confirm the sight diagnosis. I have never cheated on my wife. Weve been together since 2012 and I have not once ever had any type of STD. Never got an STD panel, so it is possible that I had this for years and not known of it. However, every medical professional I have spoken with and read about says that this type of infection usually shows up 2 to 20 days after first contact. I know I have not been with anyone else in that time period and I trust 100% that my wife has not either. We dont swing, we dont practice any sort of poly relations. What in the world is going on? Can HSV2 really ""sleep"" for 7+ years? Were going to get her blood work done as well. She doesnt seem to be holding any negative feelings on this. She is handling it very well and helping me find a therapist ( cause I am not handling it well). I guess I just feel dirty, like I am tainted. If her blood work comes back clean I am considering giving her the option to devorce. Its not a fair burden for others to carry. I have no idea when/where I picked this up, so its not like I can call around and make sure they know too. I cant even remember who I was hanging out with back prior to 2012. What do I do?

TL;DR My mother acts pretty badly with me but my brother knows her as an extremely nice person, I really need support and to talk about this to someone I'm close to but I don't want him to think that I'm lying about her/using him for money as I really appreciate him.

Some ***context***: my Mother had my Brother around 18, then his father died and she left my brother with his grandparents. She took him back in her life multiples times but only a few years as she went to another country to have a stable life. Then later on (44) she had me. My father happened to be a pedophile and my mother left with me to another city and I live with her only since I'm 4. I wasn't aware of his existence (or very vaguely) until this year. First time I met him was a quick dinner where I also met his daughter(9) second time was 3 weeks ago where I spent a day with him, my mother and his daughter.

I've always been very very close to my mother until I turned 16 I think? That's when she noticed that I loved drawing and decided to shut down this passion by every means, she would tear up my stuff, screams when she saw a doodle in my HS textbook and blames everything on my art ""If you have bad marks it's because you draw."" ""Keep on drawing and you will fail in life."" It's also the moment where I started to spiral into depression. She strongly believes that depression doesn't exist: ""It's a thing that white people made up to have an excuse when they are just really lazy."" So no support for me from her.

It spiraled so badly that one day when I was basically begging for support I came to her saying that I wanted to kill myself and she simply said: ""Then go ahead what do you want me to say?"" I felt very betrayed. It never ameliorated. The week before my hs finals she threw me out at 3 AM because I told her that saying that Asian people are all dogs wasn't really correct. And this happens a lot so I learned to shut up when she says this kind of things (I mean I'm trying, she still threw me out recently because I pointed out that we had Arabs in our football team and she told me to get fucked by Syrians???) She is like this a lot. I shut up when we get into arguments but she always compares me to my father, ""You're just like your father."" ""A monster that's what you are don't you have any respect for me? Just like he had for you when you were a child."" And this over literally anything. I can't say anything bad to her because ""I saved you from him all by myself you should be grateful."" ""How dare you talk like this to the person who sacrificed everything for you?"". She also guilts me a lot into telling her that she a good mother, sometimes after her screaming monologues she would cry saying that she's a bad mother and she worked hard for nothing and such and I feel bad enough to say the opposite.

A moment to remember is when she said while crying that I was the only one that ever helped her because one day I surprised her by inviting her to a restaurant while my grown brother only called her in 30 years to ask for money. Later you'll see that it was a big big lie.

So 3 weeks ago ***I met my brother*** with the rest of our 4 persons little family, he's amazing, has a lot of life experience and made his own fortune all by himself when no one believed in him! He took back some businesses that didn't work, made them work so good that everyone asked him to make their work again and he owns a restoration chain in the US that he wants to expand in the UK in the next few years. When he talked to me about his life stories, every time he says that he worked on something that didn't work my mother muttered that it was a bad idea and that he could've lost it all/shouldn't have done that. If he had listened to her, he wouldn't be here now.

Then at the restaurant, I joked saying that he could pay something for our mother for once and he responded by ""every time you come to the Caribbeans I'm paying everything for you both but I can pay the bill now if mom wants me to."" Oh. Ok. We're going here a lot so he's far from not helping financially as she said to me.

At one point we were talking about our mother, he said that she reads a lot and loved books, I told him that in 19 years of life I never ever saw her reading a book and that she constantly watches TV, this is a very important bit as she said to him ***""See how she badmouth your mother, making me look like I'm not an intellectual? Just like your father's mother badmouthed everyone.""***

First I noticed that we were far from knowing the same person and that he will now think that I talk shit about her.

It went great with my brother tho, he loves comics as well! And videogames, history, and philosophy! I was so happy to talk to someone who, when disagreeing with me, simply explained his point of view and had greats and diverse arguments instead of screaming at me. We talked a lot while walking however every two minutes or so, my mother would turn around and say ""We aren't here to hear you talking."" ""Do you even breath sometimes?"" ""You annoy me please stop talking."" ""It's been a few times that you said this name, I don't care."" And she snapped when we arrived close to a monument ""Anon shut the fuck up now we're in a family meeting not in a we-have-to-listen-to-your-lunatic-speech meeting."" And I shut up. It made me terribly sad as we had a lot of fun with my brother, you know when two best friends scream together ""YESSSSS"" when they notice that they like the same thing? We did this a lot. He's great.


So yeah. Before leaving he made me install Whatsapp so we could talk together, I'm very glad that I have a nice family member to talk to however, I don't know how to talk to him about what's happening, why do I want to leave the house and if he could help me with art school.

782,allthestarsalign,[new],6,c64qxi,0,"Throwaway and also on mobile. I've [30F] been exclusively seeing someone [32M] pretty great for a few months but something weird happened the other night that has me questioning things.

Earlier in the week I baked him something for his birthday and asked what his plans were so that I could bring them over the night before or of his bday for him. He told me he had dinner plans on his bday but then nothing after, so we planned on that night. That night comes and he lets me know he's feeling sick after his dinner and isn't up for much. Nbd, this stuff happens. I decide since he doesn't live too far, and because he's leaving the next day for a trip, that I'll drop off the stuff on his doorstep in case he feels better that night or the next morning before his trip, or can just freeze it for when he gets back.

This is when I got a flag. He asks if I can keep the cakes for him, and if he can get them from me the next day in between all the errands he has to run before his trip. I'm already in my car so I tell him so and say not to worry, he doesn't have to open his door, I'll just leave them. Also I have work the next day so that wouldn't work anyway. He then asks if he can pick them up from me at my work, he's interested in seeing my office. At this point I start getting the sense he really doesn't want me to stop by for some reason. I don't want him to add more errands before his trip, so I keep driving. I start wondering What if he's not home? I bet his next message will be that he had to run out for something ... and he eventually messages again saying he's going to the store to get medicine and some things for his trip. So when I get to his place, his car isn't there and I just leave the stuff on his porch. I message him letting him know that things were left and head back home, take a Xanax, and sleep off the worries. The next morning I woke up to a text from him around 4 hours after the drop off, in the middle of the night (which isn't unusual for him) saying something along the lines how I'm the best.

It seems pretty obvious he lied, right? He wasn't home, canceled our plans with an excuse, then basically got caught not being home like he said he was. I'm not necessarily saying he's cheating; he could have been out doing something else. Hell he really could have run to the store. I just don't know why he'd be adamant about trying to get the stuff from me the next day, or lie about being home, when we're very open and flexible with each other. If he wanted to cheat he could have told me to come over the previous night when I asked? Idk! I just worry that because of my past of being cheated on that I'm over exaggerating? But I'm also worried because of my past of putting up with being cheated on that I'm being a chump trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on whether I should bring this up to him or let it slide. I know logically I should just bring it up and if it's a good relationship we can work it out. But I also don't want to make a big deal over speculation, you know?

TL;DR Imagine *The Devil Wears Prada*, only he is the ambitious one and I am the sulky SO.

My boyfriend currently works for a company at the side, and they offered him to lead a pretty big project next year starting next autumn. This is a great opportunity for him, but it will be a crazy amount of work - he is expected to work 9-10 hours a day and to come in 6-7 days per week.

He doesn't live in the same town as me, so the deal right now is that we are living our lives during the week and then he visits me or I visit him over the weekend. We are both not really good at communicating on the phone, so for the time we are not with each other, communication is limited to sending each other memes and maybe some small-talk/ jokes on Whatsapp. I'm fine with that, and I do like this communication as a reminder that everything is okay, he's thinking about me etc.

Lately, I've been getting a taste of what the following year will be like as he is very busy with meetings and preparations for the project. We exchanged two messages at most every day for the past week. This weekend, I have a thing coming up (some festival where my Uni choir will be performing, and a little dinner party afterwards). It's more of a bring-your-parents kind of thing (which I don't have), so I was excited for him to come as my plus-one. He had been planning on coming since a few weeks. When I told him about the organizational details this week, he said that he has a lot of work going on and will try and see whether he'll come depending on how tired he is.

I know that he DOES work a lot and I can understand that he's tired, but I am still pretty gutted now and I'm worried I am going to get very frustrated with this. I will spend my weekends at his place, but will only get to see him when he comes back tired in the evenings. He will probably not have time to visit me or take part in my life. The situation is time-limited, but one year feels quite long for me right now as we've only been together for around ten months.

I don't know what to do here. My needs definitely won't be met, but I don't want to break up. Sometimes I think that I am just a big asshole for doubting the relationship when he gives me no other concern except for being hard-working.

In this time he cheated on her but they managed to over come this and they got engaged(which lasted 9 months or so), however after living together for three months they ended up doing long distance due to university which took its toll on both of them and she broke off the engagement. 

It was messy and they were both hurt. They both have depressive tendincies and I think they both used this to get attention from each other after the breakup.  She ended up traveling between him and university a lot (which arguably put her degree in jepordy). After the breakup but they managed to cut ties about 3 months later and werent talking regularly with each other anymore. 

They never really got over each other, and have had intermittent meetings at parties or gigs and they always end up falling back in love or hating each other by the end of the night. This happened for a few more months and they started talking again recently and she is now convinced that she wants to be with him again.  Normally at this point I'd encourage her to go for it as she is in love and I think youve always gotta give it a shot.  

However, I dont think it was a healthy relationship in the first place and since breaking up he has: said ""i love your personality but i dont think i find you attractive"", He has slept with her friends, and and has used his suicide attempt to make her go to see him. 

I have had a drunk chat about it with her and she seemed to understand that she might get hurt again but I think she looking at it all with rose tinted glasses on and doesnt want to see these massive red flags. This new relationship would still be long distance. 

Am I right to try and talk sense into her(sense in my opinion which may be wrong) or should I encouage her to give it one more shot and be there if it falls apart (of course I will be) - which was a very difficult time in her life, last time.

I've had two serious relationships in my life so far and each time I've been cheated on. Both have been somewhat long term, the first being 10 months and the second was 2 years. 

I get the first one, it was just dumb 16 year old teenage stuff. I'm okay with that. 

The second one was a bit more serious. We both got on well (still are close friends actually) and everything just seemed to work well till she started to lose interest in me and long story short. She ended up cheating on me with a coworker who was 10 years older than her, he was married and a father of 2 kids. That was really hard for me to deal with and I blindly loved her, so I helped her through it. She knew it was wrong to sleep with him etc, but I liked her too much to just let her cope with her mistake by herself.

788,Throwaway80274,Non-Romantic,118,c643ys,270,"I don't know where to start, I just learned on my own that my dad is cheating on my mom. I was just outside and he left his phone on and so I was gonna turn it off. I picked it up to find the power button but before that I saw a text. And me being me I assumed it was about his work and I was curious what they were doing at his work until I saw a lot of ""I love you"" messages back and forth. I didnt even think of it as an affair more as a friend telling his friend that they love them and appreciate them in life but as I scrolled up I read more than I wished. They were passionate and i only remember a few specific texts from the convo but I read enough to know they've done it and it was a continuous thing and it looked like it could develop more. 

I dont know what to do. I discovered this information last night and it's barely even day breaking and Its been continuous non-stop on my mind, I Googled what to do and see stories of what happened and how others dealt with it but I just need more help and advice. I turned 18 not that long ago and I'm just getting ready to start my life by first going to college. And just having knowledge of this makes things seem like its gonna outcome so different. I'm thinking too much on it and I hate it and I wish I never had knowledge on it I wish It never happened. I had a panic attack twice within these past 8 hours. 

My dad is well a dad, he provides for the family and he is constantly working to pay off loans and plus we are building a house so theres that too. I can only imagine the stress and hard work he is putting in for the family but like now with this knowledge everything seems so different.

My mom is the best mom ever. She grew up in a tough country and lived through it all, I want to give my mom everything she wants and I cant. I ask her every holiday what she wants and she never wants anything and it frustrates me because i want to get her something expensive and nice to show how much i love her and appreciate everything she's done for me. And with this knowledge, I dont even want to think how much damage this could do to her. Plus recently she lost her father and then her mother was diagnosed with Dimentia and she's just going through a rough time.

I'm afraid that any decision I make is going to end up with a terrible outcome. If I dont tell anyone about it then my parents end up separating over this affair and if that happened I would probably admit to knowing about it and if I did that everyone would be pissed at me because maybe there could be another outcome. 

I could confront my mother about it but it would destroy her and I dont have the proof she would ask. The proof is on his phone and he sure might delete the proof before I could ever show my mom. SO MANY OUTCOMES. I'm freaking out. If I confront my dad then i would tell him to tell my mom or I will. 

I have a brother and I feel the most comfortable telling him about the situation but I havent yet. Should I or should i not? I wanna tell my brother but then I would ruin the relationship between my brother and my dad. 

If you read through this very confusing rollercoaster of panic and frustration then thank you. Please PLEASE someone help me out and talk to me on what to do and weigh my options. 

This is my first reddit post and I dont know what to expect or if I even posted this in the right subreddit.

789,boxbox1nG,[new],38,c642b9,1,"My girlfriend (27F) and I (28M) have been dating for about 4 years, living together for 3.

 Past couple months, my gf has been hanging out with a new group of friends she's met through this Facebook networking group. Initially, they'd hangout in the afternoons and weekends. But now, it's gotten to the point where they'll be out until 2AM or 3AM almost every night.
We have 2 cats as well. She used to care for them a lot and we'd always split up the work involved with taking care of them (feeding, cleaning, vet appointments). But again, past couple months after finding this group, she's been neglecting her duties and left everything about the cats up to me.

She's been getting more and more attached to her phone, just chatting with these people, first thing in the morning, last thing before she sleeps.
Speaking of sleep, it just doesn't feel right. We still share a bed, but I'm feeling less and less intimacy. She doesn't want to cuddle anymore, there's no touching, she turns away from me. We haven't had sex in months because she doesn't want to or she's tired.

Anyway, a couple nights ago, she came home early, and I just wanted to talk to her. Then she just blurted out that she wants to find herself. I didn't know what she meant and I tried to get her to clarify. She just said she wanted to be financially independent and to figure out what she's doing.

Some background on her. She's a freelance performer. We split all our costs for rent and bills down the middle. I work full time. Since she's freelance, her income is unstable, but her family helps her out when she needs it. Her family also has a history of anxiety and mental illness. She's never been formally diagnosed with anything, but she's had full blown anxiety and panic attacks before.

Anyway, I told her that I didn't understand, we split costs down the middle and that I thought her dream was to be a performer. She then shifted gears and said she feels too comfortable in our relationship and wants to figure out if this is what she really wants. It kinda went in circles like this for the night.

Fast forward to now. Her behavior is getting weirdier. She's still hanging out with her new friends late at night. Now she's texting me less and less and she doesn't respond to my texts most of the time. She finding any excuse to get out of the house quick then she'll be out and about either working or hanging out with her new friends. So she'll leave the house late morning or so then not be back until 2am or 3am. The only face to face contact I get now is the few hours she's home at night when I'm sleeping and then I get nothing for the rest of the day.

I don't know what the hell is going on. We were moving forward with our relationship before everything changed with this new group of friends. I get that yeah, she could get bored of me, but we've been really open and good with communication until recently.
I've asked her if she met someone new in this group that she's interested in pursuing. She says no. But, I find that hard to believe now. Her life now revolves around meeting this group of friends and she's basically thrown everything else to the side.

I don't know what to do. I love my girlfriend so much. I've made a lot of big changes and sacrifices over the years to keep the relationship going to get to where we're at. We've even discussed the possibility of getting married too. But now, I don't know why everything changed so fast and I don't know what to do.

So my(20m) girlfriend(21f) and I have taken a break over the course of summer vacation. I found herself distancing herself slowly from me and I immediately brought it up. For more context, you can check my last post, and I apologise for the inconvenience as I cannot post the URL link here.

Now before the naysayers jump in about how breaks don't work and all that - we established clear boundaries for the break, and a fixed end date. The break began on the 23rd of May, and is scheduled to end on the 10th of July.

We have kept in contact with each other as friends, although severely restricted - out of the love and appreciation we have for each other.

This period has indeed been incredibly painful to go through, and I have missed her like crazy. She's never been the emotional type, but she opened up to me like she had never before, and it has been difficult not knowing whats going through her head.

The point is - I want to end the break sooner, perhaps by the first week of July and I am conflicted. Should I just wait for the 10th, or should I end it within that week? I have given her the space needed and I think its okay to be a little selfish in this regard.

I am realizing that I am loved, but I just have internal doubts and anxiety. I need constant reassure from my partner that she loves me, cares about me, that I'm important to her, etc. It's not healthy and I'm starting to realize that the person that needs to change is me. I've been having a hard time dealing with this, up until it hit me that the problem is that I do not trust her enough about her affection towards me. It's absurd because she's an amazing girlfriend, but the tiniest thing or behavior can set me off in to a negative spiral of anxiety. Anyways, I wrote some affirmations for myself which helped me right away to relax :) Here is what I will read multiple times a day to myself until I truly believe it -


She loves you very much 
She is not going anywhere 
She appreciates you and trusts you with everything
You are important to her
You are just as much of a priority to her as she is to you
She has said all these things to you
You should do your best to trust her with this, because it is the truth
She wants the best for you
She wants the best for your relationship
She loves you and misses you, and it is your responsibility to learn to trust her with this

Live your relationship through this lens, and you will see that both of you will return to the amazing trajectory of your relationships development. This is the truth, and you yourself know it.

792,mightfloataway,[new],10,c63l15,2,"We?ve been together for two years, we also live together. 

Okay, to preface things, I often like to self-destruct, and my brain loves to say things that make me feel bad. It doesn?t really feel bad, actually, it makes me feel rather gratified. I say this because I might be turning something that is fairly innocent into something that makes me feel like garbage, but like, hedonistic, self-loathing garbage. 

Okay, so, my boyfriend and I have been together for a year. He?s not working, but in a PhD program, so he?s kind of poor. I say kind of poor, because he?s poor in the sense that he doesn?t have a lot of his own ?earned assets?, but his parents fully supported him through very expensive and prestigious schools for his undergrad and masters, so he has no debt and still does receive some financial help from them now. His tuition is waived, so that combined with the allowance he receives from his parent and stipend, he?s actually not poor at all. Not super comfortable or anything, but he definitely acts far more poor than he actually is. 

He is hesitant to spend his parent?s money, and I totally empathize since I feel the same way when my parents spend money on me, especially now that I?m working and have my own money. But instead... he acts like he has absolutely no money and that he?s poor because he has like $2,000 in his personal savings account. Well, whatever, as long as he?s still paying his fair share of stuff he can bemoan his poverty all he wants. The thing that really annoys me though is that he has no qualms in spending my money... and seems to not feel ANY guilt at all. Instead, he makes jokes about me being his sugar momma. It?s not like he actively ?spends? my money, but for example, he lost his wallet with all his credit/debit cards in a foreign country for a week so I sent him one of my cards that had no foreign transaction fees to use on Apple Pay. He ended spending a couple hundred dollars and while he apologized, he didn?t offer to pay me back once. I waited two weeks to see if he was going to randomly Venmo me back and nothing, so I made a passive aggressive comment, apologized, and asked for my money back. He obliged without any hesitation but it was obvious he wasn?t going to offer at all. 

Another time we went on vacation together. We paid for airfare separately, and I was going to pay for the lodging and food while he paid for the car rental and gas. Using my card, primary rental insurance was given to us for free so the rental ended up being much, much cheaper than the food and hotel. I thought that he was going to offer to pay for a few meals or offer to reimburse me a bit at the end since I ended up paying 80-20 for the trip, but instead he apologized for not realizing how little the car rental ended up being. 

I?ve called him out on it, and he thinks that I just have problems with his ?frugal? spending habits, but I?m just so baffled as to why he doesn?t feel bad when he spends my money compared to the GUILT he feels for even buying a four dollar chicken tender box from Popeyes using his parent?s money. I?ve asked him point blank, and he said that he feels like since we?re pretty serious about each other, he already feels the ?what?s yours is mine and what?s mine is yours? mentality. It?s funny because the only time he?s actually spent money on me is for my birthday and it was for a box of Fun Dip. This might sound petty, but I saw the Amazon order, and he got me the smallest box size too. It just astounds me a bit though, because I don?t feel that way about his money, definitely not his parent?s money, and I really don?t think I ever will feel that comfortable. I don?t even make that much money... compared to him it?s a bit more, but the split is like 55-45. We split the bills and rent 50-50, which might seem unfair since I make more money than he does, but if I?m being honest, he wouldn?t be able to afford anything nearly as nice or convenient if it wasn?t for me. We live close enough to UCLA that he doesn?t need to drive in my cousin?s in-law suite at a SUPER discounted price relative to market price. I was living here before he moved in with me so he doesn?t really help subsidize my life either. 

I really like him as a person. He?s not arrogant at all, listens to me genuinely, and is fun to talk to. Everything is great, and he?s super patient with my quirks as I am with his, but this really bothers me. I don?t know if I?m being overly miserly with my money either... I know my entire post reeks of resentment...

Fast forward to 2 years later, we were pretty close, I made a random comment asking him if he was popular in high school, he suddenly freaks out and blocks me.

6 months later he messages me apologising loads and saying he hopes we can be friends again. Our friendship carries on as usual, we even meet for the first time! But then a few months later the same thing happens - I can't even remember what I said but again he freaks out and stops talking to me.

At this point I'm just confused and angry, but AGAIN a few months later he comes back, extremely apologetic, saying he won't ever do it again and that he's so sorry, I told him that this was the last time I'm taking him back because it's giving me whiplash, he agrees that it'll never happen again. However, around April 2018, he does it again. I told him that if he wanted to do this whole thing again then fine, but don't expect me to take him back when he comes running for me again, then that was it.

Now, a year later, he messaged me a few weeks ago asking if we could talk because something had happened, I left him on read.
He's just messaged me again this morning saying how he hates himself for having pushed everyone away, that I was the best friend he's ever had, and that he's sorry for doing this so many times.

I have absolutely no idea what to do or think? On one hand I'm nosey and want to see what is it that's causing him to want me back so badly, but at the same time it really frustrates me that he's treated me like an expendable so many times.

I already tried posting this in another subreddit, but got no response. I'm sorry, but I'm really confused!


Background:
I (21F) met this guy (almost 21M) about three years ago. At first, he was just the drummer of my band and later on when he had already broken up with his ex girlfriend I confirmed that I have a crush on him. He already knew because someone had told him, but I'm not the type of person who likes to interfere with people's relationships.

We hang out frequently. We slept together a dozen of times, we had some sexy time but never really had full intercourse. I asked him and he said he didn't want to, so I didn't push him to do it. We never showed affection in pubblic. At first I was really in love with him and really hoped in a relationship, but he didn't want one and when he said that to me, it broke my heart and I cried in front of him.

He got back with his ex one time and that made me feel even worse, but eventually they broke up for good and we had something like a friends with benefits relationship, even though he always said to me that it wasn't just that.

Some months ago I was really angry at him and I closed contacts with him. I've done this 2-3 times, but this time it lasted way longer. He tried reaching out to me once during this big sorta ""break"" but I didn't allow him to come back.

He reached out again and the fact that he's being trying so hard to be friends again made me want to talk to him, plus I was missing him and we have similar interests. 

I went out with him a day ago and he started talking about a girl, telling me she's really hot and that they slept together without having sex and the whole time she's been teasing him. He wants to have sex with her, but he depicted her as a psycho, plus she had already a boyfriend and has no intention of leaving him.

He knows that I have a soft spot for him, and even though he hurt me multiple times I kinda still like him and I hate that I feel this way. I know I can't get in a relationship with him, but I can't understand why he told me that stuff.

Is he basically telling me that he didn't have sex with me because I'm not ""hot"" enough? Is he trying to see if I'm jealous? Did he stop because he valued me as a friend and didn't want to hurt me even more? What should I do?",1561627793.0,Old crush showing up again,0.73

So, basically, it started a month ago. I felt like something was off because she offered we try open relationship. I didnt like the idea but we tried. It didn't work out because I couldn't handle it (other people didn't know we are in relationship and I feel terrible not telling the truth).
A couple of days ago she told me she doesn't feel sexual attraction anymore. For the last 6 months. She was scared to tell me because she was afraid to break my heart. We are both under a lot of stress from uni and work. I am quite emotional whereas she is more rational. She is younger than me. It's a first serious relationship for both of us. We've been together for 3 years.
She says she might not be bisexual as she thought she was. Asexual or maybe even straight.
She still says she loves me a lot. She still loves cuddles and hugs. She still feels a very strong emotional connection. But kisses and sex don't do anything for her. She said when she kissed other the guy it felt exciting but just because he was new.
She thinks she still wants to have a future together. Have an apartment, dog and etc.
I love her to bits and it just tears me apart. She is going away for 2 months. We decided to give it time and maybe she will figure herself out. I am willing to wait. If she is asexual i want to be with her because emotional bond is way more important to me than sex. I can't imagine myself with any other person.
Am I doing the right thing? Or am i just being naive?
P.s the worst part is that we are moving in together in September. If she decides to break up with me we will have to sleep in the same bed and be in a same room for a year. She says she doesn't mind. I don't think i could handle it. I won't have the money to move out.

I?m an international student that has been studying in the us for the past three years . Over the first two years I went back to my country three times ( including winter break and summer). This summer I?m trying to avoid going back. This is mainly due to me dreading the past couple of weeks leading up to my return to the US. my parents keep pressuring me to return for the summer but I prefer to stay and  return next summer or after  I graduate. I love life back home but being back there gets me extremely emotional and sad. After going home for the summer , I always have second thoughts about my decision to study abroad and kind of regret it . I?m way too invested in this degree to consider transferring ( two more years).  
The only other option is to consider a shorter degree which would mean four years instead of five . ( parents are against it ) 
   How can I tell my parents that i enjoy coming back but it takes too much of an emotional toll on me. How can I say it without sounding like an asshole.   Parents are in their early 50s and they keep telling me we might die soon and you?ll regret not coming over .They keep telling me that I?ve changed( presumably for the worse)Emotions aren?t really discussed in my household.

801,NetworkNooob,Relationships,15,c62stb,0,"My girlfriend has some reservations about moving into my apartment. Understandable, to a point. However a few things just don?t make sense to me. Her first excuse was money; She (22F) and I (23M) went to college together, and I started working early. (We?ve been together for 2+ years. I have landed a good enough job to not only support myself, but flourish. I have a massive loft apartment in a brand new building, bought all new high end furniture as well as had an interior designer come in to make the place feel more welcoming, I have a dog and a brand new car, all paid for. I bought all of this and went this extra mile so that she would, as we discussed, not have to worry about anything with moving in. We talked about it. She helped pick out furniture and room highlights. All that being said, after all expenses I still have a couple grand to spend it save. We can afford it. So her first excuse for money being an issue is invalid.

I bring up my rebuttal. (She has no idea how much I make, but she knows I can afford it at this point). She says she doesn?t want to be ?financially dependent? on me. Well, okay, again quite understandable. With a job that makes just 10$ an hour we could split the rent. At 15$ an hour she can pay all expenses related to herself. At 25$ an hour (which she makes now) she could literally live on her own, instead of with her parents. So I refute this excuse as well. She makes enough to sustain herself her, and also to really do whatever we want in our spare time.

Another problem I have with that statement is, why can?t she be financially dependent on me if she really loves me and trusts that our relationship will last. We?ve been talking about engagement, so why is she fighting this commitment. It makes ME worried about committing. She?s sending me rings and stuff but she doesn?t want to be financially co-dependent? 

She?s so all over the place. Before declining and refusing to talk about it today, she was so excited that I bought the last piece of my bedroom set, a dresser, so that she had her own place to put her clothes. She always says how she ?Can?t wait? for us to live together, but it?s obviously a lie. I literally only got my own apartment instead of one with my friends because of how much she talked about it. I?m now in a city I don?t know, and know nobody here for about 6 months now. It gets lonely. 


I love her to no end, I miss her, we?re a good few hours apart and it?s tough to get together. I?m sure the reason she won?t move in is because she?s probably not ready. THATS OKAY. But why won?t she just say it? It?s making me lose my sanity. What am I not getting, it seems like a good deal. I?ve literally found her jobs by me, offered free housing if she chooses not to work, offered her whatever she could want, and still nothing. It?s obvious the reasons she?s given me aren?t the truth, how do I get her to actually open up about these feelings? WHY does she always talk about it if she has no intentions of doing so? I just want to be able to have a discussion so I know what to expect, like some kind of rough timeline of what SHE wants.

My ex [20f] and I [22m] have been broken up for about two years after dating for just under a year and maintaining a friendship for much longer. Since our breakup I have gone through a whole separate long-ish term relationship and she has gone through a whole lot of life as well. I don't want to put out details because I'm paranoid even though I know she won't see this. 

From what I've gathered, our relationship seems to have been the best one either of us have had. What killed it was the long distance aspect.

We've recently reconnected, admitting that we missed each others company, and now we are just as close as we ever were before dating. Shes one of those people that is very hard to actually stop loving. Even though I had moved on as best I could and try to maintain that, I find myself catching full blown feelings for her over and over again. We still live in the same areas and we are both single again. It's like we are back at square one but we know what happened last time and she's been emotionally fucked over since (which I do know is horrible and not even a fraction as bad for me as it is for her). There is no point in trying to repeat the same situation, but worse, and expecting different results.

 Every conversation seems to affirm that she is the one for me right down to the exact dog and life we want in the future, I have no way of knowing if she sees it the same way but that stupid little place in the back of my mind keeps going back to her saying that in another time and place we could work out, even though that was probably just her letting me down easy (she also recently sent me a cute video from when she came to visit me and we discussed how we were nostalgic for those days but I don't know of she meant the dating or just being able to hang out).

 She is the kind of person I refuse to take out of my life so disconnection is right out. I worry that if I keep up being friends with her without telling her how I feel, I will be doing something mentally unhealthy by bottling my feelings, and lying to her by omission. (There is always the chance that I just want an excuse to tell her but feelings are complicated and my judgement is compromised)

She is off exploring her options and living life and I do not want to burden her with the information or scare her away from me. It all around seems like a bad idea to come clean. I think I just need more rational people to tell me not to.

She moved to a different city awhile back, but will drive back here whenever she needs a haircut, dentist, etc... She will usually schedule these on a thursday or Friday then spend the weekend at our house before going home Sunday afternoon. It used to be only every once and awhile and we said she was welcome anytime, but is now every two weeks or more and for the foreseeable future she seems to have a reason to come to town like that and wants to spend the weekend at our place.
 Usually this was never a problem and it was nice to have her over, but she has a very blah attitude about life which kind of gets to you after awhile.

 We don't really know why she always wants to spend the whole weekend with us everytime when could easily drive back home for the weekend. She never gets up before noon at the absolute earliest. Other than occasionally visiting her family she stays in the guest room until we are home from work, which is usually late as we both have demanding work schedules, watch a movie, all the while texting her new boyfriend, then back to bed and repeat. If we have the day off we will hang out, but that's not everytime. I know she doesn't get along with her parents very well so she won't stay there anymore, has never given any reason why she doesn't stay with siblings, her boyfriend works on the road and lives quite far away. 

It sounds like a ridiculous problem to have, but how do we get her to not come so often and not stay the whole weekend when we know we will barely have time to actually spend with her? We plan to be gone this weekend and she knows that but still is asking if she can stay at the house. 

Neither of us can think of a way to talk to her about this without sounding like assholes (again it sounds ridiculous given that this our own house we are talking about) she has some depression issues and can be a bit sensitive, and don't want to wreck our friendship.

One of them is regarding the use of Instagram, he doesn't want guys on my profile looking at me or messaging me so I unfollowed every single random guy. I'm not as jealous as him but I thought I want it to be fair so I asked him to do the same - he said he'll do it in his own time. He also doesn't want me uploading pics so we both decided to stop uploading pics.

I told him a while ago that I will not accept his double standards, and if he doesn't remove those girls (like he made me remove random guys I've never spoken to) then I will post whatever I want.

I?ll preface this by saying i thought to bring this issue to reddit thanks to u/weddingdrama1205 who seems to have a similar issue themselves, but unfortunately their thread didn?t appease my qualms about choosing my brother!

So as a bit of a backstory, as you can see by the ages posted, my brother and I are a little over a year apart in age, and my sister is more than six years younger. I?ve always had an amazing relationship with my younger bro, and not so much with my sister. You would think that having more than half a decade between us would be enough to possibly soften any conflicts, but unfortunately not.

We were, in all honesty, jerks to each other. I resented her for replacing me as the apple of my father?s eye, and she resented my scholastic achievements. I also, as I have admitted to her, was quite a callous teen and felt little to no attachment to an elementary age sister. Yes, this does make me an asshole, and more than halfway through high school I changed my tune, but there?s always been a rift between us. Petty perhaps to most, but when siblings feel they have been pitted against each other since the younger was born, it doesn?t end well for either party.

My brother, on the other hand, has been my rock. My parents both worked full time my entire childhood, and so we were left to our own devices. I was nearly seven and he was six when my sister was born. That gave us a lot of time to bond, obviously. And, living in the country, we had no neighbor kids to play with. So he became my best friend. Throughout all the turns in life, we?ve been there for each other. I honestly consider him more of a twin than a younger brother.

Now, that being said, I?m getting married! Yay, right? Except maybe not. Immediately when I started thinking of arrangements I just had a gut feeling my brother should be my man of honor. My SO is on board, he plans to have his cousin as best man and three other friends as groomsmen. Right now I have two friends and my sister in mind for mine. My parents, unfortunately, think this is a terrible plan.

I brought up the idea to my mom about a week ago, and she immediately shut it down. She claimed it would be a slight to my sister, and ?improper? on top of that. My father wasn?t thrilled either, though he just said it was ?downright weird?. I haven?t talked to my sister about it yet, but now I?m on edge.

Also, I will say that my sister is mostly reasonable, but she is very easily swayed by my parents, and so if they get it into her head that this is a bad idea, it?s game over. And though I love her, she tends to be a bit of a drama queen and just doesn?t feel right for my maid of honor.

So, what do I do? How do I approach my sister? Will it simply be easier to appoint her maid of honor and suck it up? Or should I screw the whole thing and appoint one of the bridesmaids so no one is happy?

We (32-M and 25-F) have been together for 4 years, through lots of hard times. In this situation I just don?t know if there is anything more I can be doing. 


My SO?s sister passed away very unexpectedly recently. Guys, I don?t know what to even say about this part. She just stopped breathing one day (20 years old) and was on life support for a week. 


She was a beautiful light of a person and this was completely unexpected and horrendous. Toxicology showed no irregularities and she was otherwise in good health. Punctured lung likely due to the CPR. Traumatic is an understatement. She had everyone from bus drivers to random people she talked to on facebook showing up at the hospital, she was such a friendly person. I?m not exaggerating when I say there were at least 40 or so people there daily to try to be supportive and help get her woken up from her coma. 


My boyfriend and his family seem to be handling this about as well as you can in this type of a situation.

I have done all the things I can possibly think of, like cooking breakfast for everybody daily and cleaning/laundry/dishes just so that those who are grieving don?t have the extra stress.

She was always putting me down, calling me names and just plain rude. Started hanging out and she keeps calling me out on my witty comments and fast responses to her comments. 

So, after the breakup i was extremely depressed, this girl completely destroyed me, not only by cheating, but with her shameful comments towards me. 

I decided to block her number from my phone. Going full no contact. 

At the time of the breakup, i was a little overweight, she?s always been small and she knows she has gorgeous eyes, that would render any man or woman, speechless. She uses her good looks for personal gain and she?s good at it. 

I went full force into the gym, lost a bunch of weight, lifted heavy, lost fat, now i look completely different. The gym and soccer gave me a self confidence that I didn?t have before. 

My self esteem has improved, I?m no longer the jealous crazy person she left behind. 

5 months later, she found a way to contact me, we started hanging out again, it?s fun, the banter back and forth, the adventures, that?s all back, we even had sex a couple days ago. 

What?s not back is the jealousy, the anger, the expectations, the trust. 

I don?t believe a word she says, but we have a good time together. In a non sexual way, and we have great sex, but it?s only happened one time since we got back in contact. 

Today she said to me ?you?re such an ass, that weight loss gave you all the confidence?.. mostly because I won?t let her be a jerk to me, i have a response as quickly as she ditches a comment. 

She also said ?seems like you?re so full of yourself now, caring about your appearance?.. 

She tries to make me jealous by mentioning other men, I don?t react in the way that she wants me to and she says, ?don?t act all cool, i know you?.

She?s fun, but a mess, I enjoy time with her, but I don?t trust her at all.. I don?t let her bring me down anymore, she doesn?t affect me in the same way.. she?s flakey. 

We go days without talking and then she reappears, mostly cause she needs something. 

I don?t really know if I want to be her friend, I wouldn?t even call us that, but i know that she has no one. People also use her for sex or whatever. She can?t rely on anyone. 

She?s a hot mess, she?s been through a lot in life and it left her empty inside, she doesn?t know how to love anyone, not even herself.  

I?ve thought about blocking her again. 

I?ve never been able to talk to her, tell her how i feel, because she explodes into rage.

My life is about to totally and radically change and I can?t get myself in the mindset to be happy about it. I know that a lot of the opportunities that I have, I am lucky and not everyone gets to live a life like this but I need to rant, get things off my chest and get advice from the amazing reddit community (probably including a few home truths).

3 years ago I graduated university and qualified as a teacher. After teaching in a poor school in London I took the opportunity to move to South East Asia and work in an international school. With nothing holding me back (and being 100% single) I couldn't turn down the opportunity and packed my bags and left.

I quickly met a girl from work (5 years older than me, but stunning all the same) and very quickly fell in love. I thought she was perfect for so long and treated her like a princess, however the cracks quickly began to show. We have had issues for as long as I can remember but I?ll try to summarise them. (2 months prior to me meeting her, she?d had a termination with a guy who she says is just a friend, but had been sleeping with on and off for the past 10 years. She constantly messaged this guy on snapchat despite me sharing with her on multiple occasions, how it made me feel. There was also an anonymous emailer sending both of us emails suggesting that she was sleeping with this guy while she was on holiday in england. This guy is also black, which is her type and she likes to brag about. She also constantly brings up her exes, and guys she's slept with. She has also gone off at me on multiple occasions whilst drunk for no apparent reason. Because of all these issues, I stopped treating her as well and our relationship has ultimately sunk to nothing. We live together, and share a group of friends so it has been very awkward at times. As our times were roughest when we were both looking for new jobs, we both got jobs but at different schools, on different sides of the world. It killed me when she accepted the offer as I knew it meant we didn?t have a future. 

We have been living together for the past few months kids of in a weird limbo. Not together but sharing a bed, and sometimes sleeping together and cuddling. One of the guys that lives locally smokes a lot of weed and I have been joining him and now smoking every night for a few months to try to escape reality. She leaves on Sunday and I don?t know if/when I will ever see her again. 

I leave on Tuesday to travel to Australia for the first time ever, before visiting home for just over a week before I move out to a new country and a new job.

I?m overwhelmed to be leaving everything I have grown over the past 2 years, a relationship  (however turbulent) with a girl that I do still, painfully, love. A job at a school where I feel settled and while the school definitely has its faults and is the move is good for my career, to a completely unknown entity of a new school. I?m moving alone, with no friends or partner, while everyone else in life seems to have a compatriant that they adventure through everything with.

To top all of this off, my gym routine for the past 3 months has been shockingly inconsistent. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of the year, but as lots of things have come up and not feeling great, the gym has gone on to the backburner for me. Which in turn makes me feel less confident about my body.

Even when I speak to my mum back home (I'm the eldest of 5) she tells me of how my sister made 30k profit last year with her business or how my brother has just purchased a house. I just feel like an absolute failure. The first child who went to uni, I have no savings, nothing of note that I own and now my head is an absolute mess.

How do I get out of this hole that I am currently in and live my life and be happy? I honestly feel like I could breakdown and cry at any minute.

814,throwmeaway__2,[new],7,c62a2p,2," 

so throwaway for obvious reasons. I started dating my GF of 1 year while she was with her ex. As we grew closer beyond friends, they eventually broke up(they were in long distance while GF was in same town as me). Dunno if its pertinent, but her ex\[25m\] is really shy/unattractive and hasn't been with anyone other than my current GF whom he met in high school and pursued really hard before she said yes. From what I have been told, he has no girls who are his active friends apart from my GF which makes the situation a little bit worse IMO.

Anyway, at the time of breakup, my GF said she would like to continue to be friends with her ex as he has been her friend for 10 years and I didnt wanna be a jerk or controlling and agreed. We had a couple of agreements, no emotional cheating, no talking about relationship with him and if he hits on her, she tells me and tells him to back off.

Over the last year we have had a few big fights, all because she wouldn't honor the last 2 parts of our agreement. Her ex continued to send her messages which would vary from subtle hints about getting back together and pretty direct talk about getting back with her. Fairly explicit references.

She never really responded back to him asking him to stop(or otherwise) and we often argued about it. Later she stopped telling me when he would hit on her. I would discover by chance if her phone was opened or if she opened her messages in front of me.

A few weeks ago, we almost broke up when I snooped on her messages(I know). It was a pretty direct attempt at getting back with her telling her that it was a mistake to break up and he should have told me to fuck off etc. And again she didnt tell me. I was ready to breakup but she asked me to give her one more chance. I did make her tell him to move on, but he responded back by saying if she is ever single he is waiting for her.

Now, one more pertinent detail is that this guy has done the same thing in the past with my GF when she was with her ex-ex. he kept persisting and she eventually ended up cheating with him and broke up with her ex-ex. She claims that he was abusive and hence it happened and not because she wanted to cheat.

I really dont know how to handle the situation, apart from her ex, everything is perfect, but I dont want to waste the prime years of my life with someone who is going to end up with the same guy who will perpetually be single for her. I have talked to her about it a few times, she is always apologetic about hiding his advances but claims its purely platonic from her side and he just has nostalgia. She agrees he shouldnt hit on her. After the last incident she even changed her passcode which seemed fair but ironic but now I would really not find out if he hits on her again. She has also in the past just deleted the messages wherein he has hit on her to avoid having a discussion with me.

Half of my brain says she is the one and as we get more serious her ex would have to back off. The other half is telling me that history will repeat itself and I am getting clear signals to not go forward.

There is a 10ft x 20ft plot divided in half, where I have 1 half (10ft x 10ft) and the other folks have the other half (10ft x 10ft). This means that there's just a string down the middle of our plots to divide our space up.

I'll call the neighboring plot folks my ""neighbors"" from now on.

Let me also explain that my neighbors are not noobs who don't understand how plants grow and get big. The guy was raised on a farm and has tons of experience. I know this from the orientation we all had.

My neighbors and I set up our gardens very differently. I began developing my plot first, and made a vague path down the middle of mine from the far end in the direction of their plot so that I can access everything on either side including the end that neighbors theirs. This is a pretty typical garden path that almost everyone else with a wide width does, otherwise your middle plants are unreachable. At the end of the path you run into a wall of tomatoes. I have 4 tomatoes spanning the 10 ft width of my garden where my plot and theirs meets, a line which I also planted marigolds against for some spacing and a clear boundaryline (my entire garden is edged in marigolds actually).

The neighbors completely filled their garden plot with plants and plotted no walkable space to access anything. They planted 2 rows (and more scattered) of 5 tomato plants per row for the 10 ft of width up against our line of string (I say this to give an idea of how cramped they made their space). This among other things filling up the entire 10 x 10 plot. That's great...except unless they want to step on squash plants or break their tomato plants, they have no way of accessing anything that isn't on the edges of their plot.

--> This is where it turns out they have been using my pathway through my garden to access their plants. Thing is, my pathway doesn't even go all the way to their side. It goes until I reach my wall of tomato plants...which apparently my neighbor has been going between in order to prune/water/weed their plants. There isn't even reasonable space to go between these - there just happens to be more space than how they set their garden (hence me mentioning them cramming 5 plants and not 4 like myself). This would require them to move some branches of my tomatoes as they access their plants.

Now this worked fine while the tomato plants were small - but now they're getting massive and my neighbor physically has to risk breaking my plants in order to get to their plants. Not only that but my path requires them to walk completely through my garden to reach theirs so this isn't just like a path parallel their spot. This also means they've been dragging the hose through my plot to reach theirs.

That's another point. There are faucet/hose hookups next to almost every single plot. Each pipe allows for two hoses. Most gardeners bring a hose if one isn't already there. My neighbors have a hose hookup literally 3 feet away from their plot, but have not purchased a hose and use the one all the way near the end of my plot (one plot over from mine even). The hose doesn't reach their entire plot so my guess is they keep dragging the hose through my plot when they go through my garden for access. Anyway.

As an aside... I'm left wondering what the hell they're thinking if continuing this once the tomatoes grow even bigger and fill in these minimal gaps (which they absolutely will). There would be NO way for them to go through my space without breaking things or knocking a tomato off a vine. Like their plan isn't even sustainable?!?

Back to my original question...am I being an asshole? Is this normal? Should I try to accommodate my neighboring garden and gardeners somehow (seriously though, it almost isn't an option)? I feel like a petty jerk and need some kind of feedback or perspective. Thanks for any response.

She had already known but it was a reminder and she had forgotten. She proceeded to freak out, screaming at me and talking about how I am leaving her and how its unfair. 

I explained that this is one week and we spend every single day together, and that i never spend time with my family and that I really enjoy that. She called me selfish for leaving her behind to go relax on the beach while she ?sits around doing nothing?. I told her to hang out with people and she said no one will be around?? She said I was abandoning her.  She is leaving for college for the first time two weeks into August so she says that at the start of the month she will be very emotional and that its selfish of me to leave her in that state. 

She screamed in my face and told me that was she was going to ?make my life a living hell while I?m there?. When I yelled back she threatened to punch me in the face. She decided to set ?rules? involving me having to text her at all times and never miss a text, always send my location and a picture, and stay up until at least 3 am every night to make sure she is done talking to me. She expects me to ask my family if I can stay home alone for a week and not go. I don?t know what to do there is no getting through to her. She will not change her mind and keeps insulting me and yelling at me and then will turn around and beg me to stay. 

We?ve had some issues in the past and recently I?ve been noticing a trend of her getting overly angry with me and insulting me. It also seems like she can never admit to being wrong. Every argument we have I end up apologizing even when Ive done nothing wrong.

817,possiblebpdsohelp,[new],10,c61pq2,3,"My thoughts are all over the place so please excuse the fragmented post. I'll try to put down everything pertinent so that it hopefully makes sense.

Bf and I initially started dating 4 years ago and as most BPD relationships go, things got very intense very fast. It was a whirlwhind and I was just to happy to have found my person. However, once the honeymoon phase ended and things settled down he became verbally abusive worsened by pretty bad alcoholism (we he hid from me initially) and we had some knock down drag out fights which ended up with me finally breaking up with him 2 years into the relationship. There was never any physical abuse, only verbal and emotional.

It was a terrible break-up and something I really don't like to think about. 3 months after the breakup he reached out me and asked to talk. I refused to meet up with him but he asked to talk on the phone, which we did. He started off by apologizing for his behavior and then went on to explain that he had started therapy and was on medication. He said that after we broke up he realized how shitty he had been and that he never wanted to put anyone else through that (he also has a history of neglect and abuse by both parents and realized that he was doing to me what they had done to him). He asked if we could talk and maybe become friends and initially my answer was an immediate no but he asked me to give him another chance because he truly thought we had something worth saving. Over a 6 month period, we talked and texted and he told me about all the things he was doing in the therapy, the exercises and treatment his therapist and him were undergoing and I could tell that things were different. He would still get angry but I could tell the exercises he was using to restrain his anger and the healthy avenues he would now take to calm himself down from reaching the fever pitch rage that caused our horrible fights before. So when he asked if we could start seeing each other again, I said yes.

Over the past year and half, we have seen each other once a week as my work is very intensive and I was applying for a graduate program. During this time, we have not had one fight but I've still been cautious and admittedly haven't fully allowed him to become integrated back into my life. We don't ever hang out with my friends and when we do hang out with his, the outings are few and far between. I think somewhere in the back of my head I was still scared that things were going to go back to the way the were. I recently found out that I have gotten into my dream graduate program which requires me to move a few hours away. When the topic came up of what we should do, he asked if I would consider us moving in together and I said yes. I discussed this with my therapist and she suggested we should try living together as I still had some hesitancy about the relationship. She advised that living together could finally help push me into full commitment or finally realizing that this was not what I wanted. I also said yes because I know he would be really hurt, and again I feared him getting angry if he said no although since we had gotten back together, he had not once raised his voice to me. He has made a lot of progress and even his friends have commented on how different he is.

That was until 1 month ago. We were out to dinner and I made a joke about something and we ended up in a little fight that became massive and he fell into his old pattern and the same rage and inhibited anger came right back. It was bad. Really bad. He never physically hurt me, but it felt like the same type of fight and verbal abuse that had made me run 2 years ago. I was so angry that I was being put through this again that admittedly I screamed right back and it was one of our worst fights ever and lasted well into the early morning.

I went home the next morning and we didn't talk for 3 days. I finally called him up fully intending to break up with him but before I could he asked if he could talk first. He apologized profusely for the way he had acted, expressed disappointment in his behavior and told me he didn't want to try and convince me to stay. In the past, I had pointed out his habit of manipulating me after fights to make himself the victim and he said he did not want to do that now and it was why he waited for me to call him instead of the other way around. His job is in sales and he is very good with his words (he really could sell ice to a eskimo) so he wanted to give me space to figure out what I wanted. In the past, he would call the next morning and within an hour would have me thinking everything was fine and that I had overreacted, that fighting like that was normal in a relationship.  He did go on to explain that the fight was brought on by the fact that he felt hidden over the past two years and like I was ashamed of him.  He said the joke triggered his insecurity. That the anger and resentment, embarrassment was the word he used, bubbled over and he couldn't hold back even though I pleaded with him to stop. He told me he would totally understand if we were to break up and that he would never hold it against me and would fully understand.

I'm an idiot and immediately went into trying to dull his hurt and just pushed everything under the rug. If you know anyone with BPD, they tend to suffer from a very severe fear of abandonment and bf is no different. I launched into trying to soothe him and in the process totally bungled what I had wanted to say for 3 days.

I told him I didn't care what the reason was, he was never allowed to speak to me that way. He promised it would never happen again and pointed out that since going into therapy and us getting back together this was the first time this had happened but even then he acknowledged that he hated that he had fallen back into that pattern. He said he would leave it to me to decide but, that if we were to go forward, that he wanted to be acknowledged by my friends and family. That his insecurity was something he would work on but he still couldn't help but be hurt by the idea that I was feeling ashamed of him.

Ultimately, looking back at his progress and admitting to myself now that I was still a little in shock at the time, we decided to try. I told him if he was willing to keep working on his therapy, I would make an effort to integrate him more in my life. And that if something like this ever happened again, there wouldn't even be a discussion we would just be done. He agreed.

However.

I can't help but be absolutely terrified. When he fights, he fights dirty. He cursed out my brother and sister, my mother- I am incredibly close to my family and he used that as ammunition. He brings up my exes, all the mistakes I have made in the past in our relationship, my failures, and my insecurities about my profession that I have expressed to him when I was vulnerable. He just rages at the top of his lungs. For hours. No amount of pleading or crying or even shutting down will stop the tirade until he literally tires himself out.

Our move in date is getting closer and I'm fully having a panic attack. I am moving away from my family and any type of support system and while I will have insurance for therapy, my studies will be so intensive that I will barely have time to get a good night sleep every night let alone speak to a therapist. I don't know what to do.

He has worked very hard in therapy to overcome his anger, but he still has a ways to go. I understand this was probably a relapse but at what point am I supposed to forgive a relapse and at what point should I decide that this is not the way I want to live. I truly do love him and am so proud of how far he has come. He is my best friend and my one of my biggest supporters and we really do have a lot of fun together. I can also honestly say that despite this one fight, our relationship in the past year was leaps and bounds healthier than it was 4 years ago.

I don't know how to reconcile the love I have with the panic that I feel. I am terrified of being isolated and terrified that IF we go back to fighting that way while we live together I will have nowhere to turn. I am scared that this will cause me to fail out of my program and fall back into the depression I suffered from after our initial break up. He has sold his apartment and a lot of his stuff and we are mere days away from the big move. I know a lot of this is my fault, a lot of this is stuff I should have addressed when we talked after the fight but the verbal abuse really affected my self-esteem. I take a while to process my emotions and I am still trying to find my voice and enforce my boundaries, though I am getting better. It took me till now to even admit to myself what I was feeling.

Should I break up with him? Or should I just swallow the panic, move in together and see where it goes? He will be continuing his therapy and medications in the new city for what its worth.

But these last couple months have been as solid as ever and I recently decided I was ready. Even paid for the ring. In between the exciting days of ring shopping I occassionaly had some rough days. Over the past few weeks they've become more and more frequent. I have troubke focusing at work. I've been smoking more pot than ever before, not so much for enjoyment but for *something to do*. I don't have any friends. Have felt myself losing interest in most things.

I have a long history with depression. At my worst I've had to quit jobs, have felt suicidal, couldn't get out of bed. But funny enough, these last 4 years is the longest I've gone in my adult life without a serious episode. I'll occassionaly feel things going south but I've managed things fairly well these last few years.

We recently moved to a new city so my girlfriend could pursue a new job. She's acclimated well to the city and her job. As for me? I'm not up to much these days. No friends, not much direction, already feeling anxiety about my new job. 

Today I realized my girlfriend has never seen me at my worst. Frankly I'm not sure how she'd handle it. She's always been supportive but seems to have a somewhat naive idea of depression. She doesn't always know what to say, has sometimes said some (unintentionally) hurtful things when I've been struggling. In fairness, I have a hard time discussing my mental health with anybody.

I saw a new therapist yesterday. I had to give up one I really liked when we moved, during one of our last sessions we were discussing my relationship and he made this cryptic comment: ""It seems like your reluctance to get married has more to do with you than your relationship."" I spent years unsure if I was ready to get married. Now I feel ready but not sure if I should get engaged when things are starting to get so miserable.

819,indrazap,Breakups,8,c61k4c,4,"I was doing long distance for nearly a year with my ex before I moved to be with him. We are from different continents and met traveling.  We continued to travel together during the year.  Long story short..I moved to his country with intentions of going travelling again but for a long time. When I arrived he told me he didn't love me anymore and he was not the same person I had just been with 2 months prior. He told me he couldn't feel anything anymore and was miserable and he didnt know how to have fun etc etc. 

So I stayed at his parents with him while he continued to work as I just sat at his house. He finally decided to get therapy because he knew he was bad. It took 6 weeks to get the first session.  In that time I tried my best to help him get out of the funk. It was difficult but he showed more love as time went on. He is uncomfortable at his parents house and that was hard on our relationship as well. Well he got therapy and realized it was going to take a while to get better. He said we could stay together while he had therapy and then see at the end but our relationship got to be empty. He was so cold to me. My visa was almost up 3 months later and I had to leave. We cried for hours the day i left but had made the decision to break up. 

We agreed that because he doesn't love himself that he couldnt fully love me. I left and ended up going to Asia after a month in Europe. He found out and basically pushed me completely away. Later I found out it was because he was jealous and had visions of me doing things with guys. Well I reassured him I was not doing those things. Soon after I found out he quit his job and booked a one way flight to a party city. I panicked and felt the things he had. I asked him if he had slept with anyone or met someone on his trip.  He got defensive and told me it wasn't my business.  I got so upset because I had just reassured him a week prior. 

 He turned against me and said his attraction had changed. He said he now only values people that value themselves more than they value others.  He said that he no longer finds me attractive basically because I got needy. I also got a bit verbally abusive to him because he wouldn't give me an answer. Yes I know that's wrong and I've never done that before but he was a being so mean. I just wanted to know if he had met someone because I couldn't understand how in 1 week he no longer valued me. He had therapy for 4 months but its finished.  And now he tells me he is practicing to be more selfish. 

He has always told me I was the nicest person he knows.  But on this day he told me that I dont value myself because I put up with his immature behavior for that time at his house. He said because I didnt leave him and he told me I reinforced his bad behavior because I was good to him whether he was nice to me or mean to me.   Do you view that as having no value?

My (24) boyfriend (24) and I met 3 years ago but haven?t had the most stable relationship the entire time. Especially at the beginning of our relationship and I?m starting to feel the long term effects of it now.

For starters, when we first started to date he was still texting a girl *** from his home town who was emotionally unstable and threatening to kill herself if he didn?t stop texting her so I understood but became increasingly angry when it progressed to her professing her love for him on her media and him not doing anything to stop it. Nothing at all. I honestly think he fed off of the attention. Eventually i erupted and called her out (in a not so nice way oops) when I found her tumblr page that was about how much she was in love w him. Although she has not contacted either one of us since she?s still made a few RECENT posts about him. In my opinion his laissez faire attitude towards her and the situation made me think he didn?t care for my own feelings and though he?s assured me he does, in that moment it felt like he didn?t. 
*** this girl was SIGNIFICANTLY younger like 17. I think the fact that he knew how old she was and had a sexual relationship w her beforehand (prior to finding out her age) added to the anger and resentment and I do find myself calling him a pedo when I?m not sober.

That ^ happened August 2017 after which our relationship was a little rocky for a few months. I started drinking a lot more and going out w my friends. Sometimes kissing random men. I immediately told my bf every time and he was surprisingly understanding - mad but understanding. We decided to be a lot more open with one another and I stopped drinking as much and our relationship got a lot better.

In March when I thought all was well between us I found out that when he was out with his friends in Florida he kissed 2 girls. I wasn?t too mad about the kissing - I get that alcohol does influence a persons behavior. It was the fact that he lied about it when I asked him that irked me. Once he got back we broke up. Eventually getting back together a month later. 

There?s been a few minor hiccups since then but he?s  changed significantly . A LOT more honest. A lot more open. I truly do love him and see a future with him. But whenever I?m left alone with my thoughts I just go back to the hell hes put me through. Specifically, I can?t get over his negligence with the whole situation w the younger girl obsessing over him and the cheating. Even though he?s been honest since I always question him. I look crazy. Going through his messages and snaps when he goes back home. I?ve become so clingy because I feel like if he stays near me he won?t do anything to inadvertently hurt me. This is starting to get the better of me i have episodes where I?m just an angry blur and I don?t know how to control it. I?ve stopped drinking entirely bc anytime I do all this resentment just floods out. 

Any advice would really help but at this point I?m not sure what to do. Is this relationship still salvageable or do I move away and start fresh?

She wasn't over her last ex and ended things after I got back from a month overseas. I can deal with her being flaky and some other minor shortcomings because I see her working on herself and trying to build a better and more stable life. I know I'm a good influence in that regard and I think she'll continue to work to cultivate good things in her life. 

A month or two ago she tried to reconnect, and we started hanging out again, mainly focusing on art. I don't have anyone else in my life that tries to initiate spending any sort of time together with me and I am admittedly attention starved and am going through a deep depression, so I struggle to say no to anything that will net me some time with another human. To be honest we've been hooking up but have been making a lot of effort to communicate about everything and both agree that we aren't trying to date each other.

The thing of it is, I think I'm still in love with her, or at least the idea of who I wanted her to be for me. When we're having a good time together is really the tops. She doesn't make the best choices about who she spends time with, a lot of the people she puts time into use her for her financial successes and her attractiveness, or are seeking her time for shallow reasons(she's an exotic dancer and attracts some weird types). She's reconnecting with her last fling; a guy[44M] who in a state of drunken delirium almost steered her car off a bridge while she was driving him home. I expressed how I think that's a terrible idea but she wants to give him another chance and said she is considering hooking up with him. She's hanging out tonight with another guy [25M] tonight and she sent me a picture of herself in a hot tub saying she hopes I'm having a good night (I doubt she's tubbing alone and am so incredibly sad looking at that picture). 

I don't want to ghost her but I don't think I can handle knowing that this woman I still have very strong feelings for is getting close with other people that I'm certain don't have her best interests at heart, or only want her time because she's attractive. She seems oblivious to their intentions, but then again maybe I'm assuming, at least in the part of the second guy. Hearing her get excited about spending time with these guys just rips me apart to where all I want to do is cry. I'm already in a very dark place and this isn't helping, even though I know she has good intentions about trying to reconnect.

She had never called me before, our conversations had always been on text. And it was really random, she had never asked about me being somewhere like that. We hang out at the pool for a bit with our friends. One of my friends there is playing with his band at a bar on the lake that night. Me, her, and a couple friends ride together to the bar to watch the show.

At the bar she buys me and her a shot and we start making out. She runs into a girlfriend of hers there and they go onto a boat and leave me with my friends. We watch the show for a bit and I get pretty drunk. Its a bit blurry but I remember thinking oh crap I'm too drunk, I shouldn't be here. I plan on getting a cab home. I text the girl ""headed home, come over"" she said ""they're done playing already?"" Later I text my address and say stop by. For whatever drunken reason I end up not getting a cab and just sit there drunkenly next to my friend for a few hours until the show ends. When I leave I see the shots ended up on my tab. I don't remember getting home (don't worry... I didn't drive).

Girl calls me at 3 am but I am passed out by then. The next day she talks to one of our friends and finds out I ended up staying til closing time. She calls me later in the day and asks why I told her I left so early and didn't. I explain I was very drunk and wanted to but didn't for whatever reason. She says the reason she didn't come back is because she thought we all left from my text. She said she will pay me back for the shots. Then she says I'll take you to dinner. I say only if its a fancy steak house. She laughs and says maybe she will take me back to the bar from the previous night, they have food there. That we will figure something out for dinner soon.

That was 4 days ago. I'm thinking of texting her tomorrow and setting up dinner plans.

I am American, and my boyfriend is Mexican. This is important momentarily. 

In the past year, I moved to new big city. He was one of the first people I met - and I instantly was attracted to him. He?s made me feel more alive, sexy, and gorgeous than any other man has. We connect on a humor level like I?ve always desired. I?ve never felt a spark with someone until I met him. He seems to completely understand me. Despite his many wonderful features, he has some large drawbacks. 

We often have a problem in regards to ?joking.? I will tell him he has gone too far and it hurts my feelings. We had a fight tonight about this and I?m still feeling uneasy. He tells me that I know he is like this - he jokes. He constantly tells me it?s cultural and I shouldn?t be so sensitive. He tells me it is my problem for taking the things he says too seriously. He says that I know he jokes, therefore I shouldn?t take him seriously and it?s my fault if I take offense. I don?t know very much about Mexican culture, so I let it slide when he calls it cultural. I?ve tried to tell him that for me, it?s important to be kind and considerate... his response is ?yes, that?s you. But not me.? Am I being too sensitive?

Besides the joking, I know that logically he isn?t right for me, but I can?t seem to cut the cord. It is my dream to be married, and maybe one day have kids. He is uninterested in both. 

My boyfriend has told me he will probably be moving away in September, and has alerted me that I might not want to be with him because of his uncertainty. I was devastated by this, but we?re still together. 

My brain is telling me I just need to break up with him. But my heart is screaming otherwise. My heart tells me I would be giving up on my bliss with him, but my brains says he is problematic. 

I?m so afraid to be alone. I?ve moved all the way to this new city and I know so few people. I?m scared to lose one. Even if he isn?t right for me. How do I overcome this when I feel so conflicted about what to do? How have you, or someone you known, taken that leap??

TL;DR I(F25) know that I need to end things with my boyfriend (M27), but I?m afraid I?m making a wrong decision. I?m terrified on giving up on something special, and also being alone again.",1561610020.0,"I(25F) need to breakup with my boyfriend(M27), but fear of being wrong and/or alone stops me.",0.8
825,ProfessorThiccems,[new],3,c60wlr,3,"So recently my girlfriend brought up an internship opportunity at her dad's workplace and her dad agreed to take me under his team. All was going as planned and I will be interning for the next 11 weeks. However, after her dad told me about how long it was she suddenly started acting weirdly. She would start to ignore me, treat me like I am trash, order me around, and even if I did more than what she asked for she would not appreciate my effort. She would go on about breaking up with me, cheating on me, get a new boyfriend, and the list goes on. Even before getting accepted for the internship we agreed that I would travel 400 miles down ever other week to visit her and hangout together. Now all she says is I don't know, I don't care, or not giving a dam about me. This has been a stressful week since I had never dealt with this before and this is my first relationship. I don't what I am supposed to do and even if I try to talk to her she would ignore my questions. At this point I was completely done with this relationship and I ask if she wants to break up or date other guys or whatever and she just goes I DONT KNOW. Currently she stays at my apartment since its close for her to commute to work and using all my stuff. So at this point what am I supposed to do? She won't text me or face time me anymore like we use to, but I understand if she wants the space. She doesn't know if we are going to be together after these 11 weeks and even if I visit her she will still probably treat me like trash. Should I just break it off because I feel like I might be being used for her convenience such as her using my apartment and I would usually pay for all her food without her chipping in. Should I bring this up to her parents as I am pretty close to them already and they like me as well.

TL;DR

Girlfriend suddenly starts to ignore me and treat me like trash after she got me an internship at her dad's place. I will be gone for 11 weeks, however I will still be visiting her every other week.

826,throwafacee,Relationships,14,c60q73,1,"I feel like this sounds worse than it actually is. Sorry if it's rambly it's almost 5am and I haven't slept for a bunch of different, unrelated reasons. There's a TLDR at the bottom

I'd like to just preface this by saying my boyfriend is over emotional in the sense that he always has this constant fear that I'm going to leave him, that I dont love him and that I'm just essentially in it just because he's a ""nice guy"". We have been together for 2 years (long distance) and havent had any major problems except for this.

Since we are ldr, we see each other only a couple times a year. I'm catching a train to see him later today and I know that he's expecting intimate acts when we're together. Thing is, i kinda dont want to. 

The lust for him is there, i just want to stop for other reasons. Like i feel like it's the main thing we do when we meet. I see all these couples from ldr subreddits making all these memories and we cant. I understand why we Can't, there's a load of valid reasons (reasons are out of his control) why we cant travel out for day trips and I am completely fine with that. But whenever we just stay in and watch a movie or just general chit chat, he always moves it sexually

And it's good, there isn't an issue of him pleasing me in that manner 

I told him last time we met up that I didn't want to do any sexual acts. He got quite sad and very emotional and did cry for quite a bit. I couldn't explain why but I, again, think maybe it was his insecurities and we have different love languages in the sense of he is more vocal and corny whereas I think im more thoughtful and sentimental and tend to show my love rather than saying it. He knows we have different love languages so I think by him wanting to progress things sexually it reaffirms to himself that I do care about him as I can come across as withdrawn at times when we are apart 

I just want some advice how to approach this when I see him today. This is the last time we are going to see each other for a long time (6 months+ due to conflicting schedules) and I dont want him to play that point up ""well it's our last day sooo.."" kind of thing

-We?re in a LDR, he lives about three and a half hours away by car.  We visit each other 1-2 times a month for a few days or a week at a time. We met at the university we went to before he moved back to his hometown. 


-He hasn?t been in a relationship that?s lasted longer than a few months since he was 17.


-He?s going for a career in videoing. He has a degree in videography, which I know is a challenging market to get a leg up in. Him and a few of his friends own their own production company. Since they don?t get enough business yet to support themselves on it, he has a bartending/serving job.


As the title says, my boyfriend doesn?t feel challenged in our relationship. We?ve been dating ?officially? for about three months (we?ve known each other for a little over a year now) and things seemed to be going great, until he hit me with this today. He told me that it doesn?t feel like I?m challenging him to be a better person, and that our conversations nowadays mostly revolve around our jobs and how our day was, and that our conversations generally aren?t very interesting anymore. Being in a LDR, conversation is pretty much the only thing we have when we?re not visiting each other. He also said he feels like he?s in a rut with where he is in his career and our relationship. 


He?s supposed to meet my parents this weekend and I?m not sure if that scares him (I?ve already met his parents) and I don?t know if all of this is a defense mechanism because of all of his previous-short term relationships.


He acknowledged that I fully support him in whatever he does and I love him as-is, but right now I?m not sure if that?s enough for him. 


For the time being, I?ve looked up/thought of a list of questions that I can ask him (things that I don?t know about him, things about our relationship) if conversation becomes stagnant. But I?m not really sure what to do or how I can challenge him more. And furthermore, I feel like it?s not my sole responsibility to push him to be a better person. 


I want to be there for him and help him if he needs it, I want his problems to be my problems and vice versa. 


Any advice would be appreciated. I want this relationship to work out.

828,poppinskits,Dating,12,c60oz0,4,"When I met her I told her I didn't want a relationship and was only looking for something casual.  She was cool with this, and understood as I just got out of a very tough breakup of a 5 year relationship.


What started out as fun eventually progressed after a few months as she caught feelings. I was still skeptical of committing in a relationship, but she asked us to not see other people and hook up exclusively.  I was hesitant as it sounded like a relationship, but decided to give it a shot. 


I thought we were on the same page about being exclusive, until she ended things with me because she had sex with someone else because she didn't think I was serious about it. I was pissed and hurt especially since she was the one who wanted to be exclusive.  She was under the impression we didn't agree to it since I was hesitant.



We eventually hooked up again after that but I told her don't expect anything from me and that we weren't back to where we left off. 


After hooking up she eventually told me that she still has feelings for me, and that she needs to end it and can't be causal with me because it's too difficult and could only continue if we were to settle down. 


I feel like we were letting it grow organically, but she ruined it by sleeping with someone else, but I also was hesitant from the start to be in a relationship. I don't know if it's in general or with her, but part of me feels like I'm ruining it by not being in a relationship.


Is it better to give something a chance even if you're unsure about it, or is it better to go with your gut feeling on it? I will say her sleeping with someone else definitely hurt the chances of me wanting a relationship but I wasn't too keen to begin with. I can't shake this feeling that I'm fucking up though by not.

Now I'm recently a college graduate (I am 22 years old) and found a job somewhat close to home. She on the other hand doesn't graduate for another year and has made it clear she has the intention of living in the city (she wants nothing to do with suburban life for the foreseeable future). What makes this even more difficult is that we are from different states (I'm from Michigan, she is from Ohio, we met at school in Ohio). At this point I'm not sure what to do. I already have a job, have my closest friends and family near me, and a band. It doesn't make sense for me to even consider moving at the moment. I don't want to end the relationship but I'm just not sure if it's worth enduring a long distance relationship for that long, and I have tried to convince her.

I really love him, but in the past 6 months or so I've slowly been realizing we're not compatible long term. He wants kids and I'm still not sure, I like to travel while he could care less about seeing the world, and I want to move away while he wants to stay in close driving distance to where he's from. I don't think either of us should have to compromise on things like this.

&#x200B;

We just graduated and have been talking since the beginning of our senior year about moving in once we start working full time, but I now know that even though I love him it's just not enough. The problem is that I don't want to hurt him (even though I know this will) and I don't know how to break this to him. I am feeling extremely stressed out now though, because he's applying to jobs in our metropolitan area but I know he'll want to go back to his home city when I break things off.

831,ze_intern,[new],5,c60g4k,4,"Eight few months ago my (27M) ex (28F) and I broke up.

I'm not entirely sure what happened. When we first started dating she was obsessed with me. We spent every moment together, I met her family, friends, we were exclusive, went on trips together, etc. Attended weddings together. Never had anyone look at me like that before. Would tell me every moment how much she liked me. Just seeing me made her smile. She called constantly and I loved it. 

The weird thing is that despite how much she liked me she didn't want to label our relationship but she did initiate going exclusive. I figured she wanted to be sure. 

Then a few things happened. My mom broke her hip so I had to leave town for a few weeks, and I had layoffs at work which I survived but were hard. Our physical intimacy suffered but I tried to show her my affection in other ways (being honest with her, taking her on dates she loved, flowers, etc). I feel sick with regret for not working on our sex life more at this time. 

Also around this time her ex also came to stay with her. She said she had already promised that he could and that they were just good friends and had been for years. I let it happen but handled it insecurely. I feel regret for letting this happen too. 

Once he left we seemed to be ok for a while. But soon something changed in her and she started saying things like ""I don't feel it anymore"" and ""we might need a break."" Despite all this I tried to save the relationship. Eventually I had to break up with her because I was tired of feeling rejected and wanted her to be happy. 

When we broke up she was so upset. She said I was the best guy she's ever dated and that she wanted us to stay in touch. She told me to call or text her anytime to talk about anything and that I would always be important to her. I felt relieved when it was over, now obviously I don't. 

The days after were weird. She called me like nothing had happened to talk about her day and still texted me constantly. I offered to get back together but she said no. After about a week of this she dissappeared. 

I found out she had gone to see her ex. I also found out that they had been spending a ton of time together. Going to hockey games, skiing, etc. At this point I removed her on social media. Not sure if they are back together or still just good friends but I have feelings it's the former. I'm not saying she cheated. I don't know. 

The point of all this is that I been feeling really hurt and lost. I reached out to her for closure several weeks later and asked her to talk just so I could understand but she ignored me after telling me no because I still had feelings for her. I was floored. After months of her being so into me and telling me she was always there for me she was able to cast me away like nothing. We don't need to be friends but having closure and understanding plus her keeping her word would mean so much to me. I also miss her. 

She's the first girl I've ever felt this way about. I don't know how to feel about all the memories and feelings we shared now and I don't know how to get closure. I feel so hurt that I've had to start going to therapy, got a new condo, on meds, etc but it hasn't helped. I'm consumed with regret and doubt about how I could have done things to save our relationship. I also have no hope I'll meet someone as amazing as her again. It took years for me to find someone I had this spark with.

832,MonochromePassenger,Non-Romantic,120,c60avj,416,"For some context, I used to be a part of a friend group a year ago, but was having a lot of personal issues that were making me go kind of crazy so I went MIA for a little over a year to work on myself. No social media, no friends, just wanted to work on myself alone.

&#x200B;

Recently, they reached out to me again and wanted me to hang out with them, I agreed and it's been nice, except dynamics have changed a bit. My main friend, who I'll call Jake, now has a girlfriend, Ashley, and a girl that I believed to be the ex (Laura) of one of the other guys (Chris) now hangs out more regularly and they are ""back together."" I assumed they were ""back"" together because the entire time I hung out with them last year, he was sleeping with a different girl (one of my friends) and told me he had dumped Laura.

&#x200B;

Come to find out, he never dumped her...which made a lot of things make sense. Like, why she would occasionally be in his room while he was seeing someone else and why she would post on social media as if they were still together. He explained it back then as, ""Oh, she's fucking psycho. She still thinks we're dating."" He allowed people to call Laura psycho in his presence and perpetuated it quite a bit to the point where a lot of people even outside the friend group called her ""psycho"" and still do to this day.

&#x200B;

Apparently, she did not know that he was sleeping with someone else during this period but suspected. I brought it up to Jake and Ashley and they told me not to say anything and that the scores were settled anyway because she *also* cheated once upon a time. Jake also claimed to ""not remember"" any of the events of last year so he conveniently couldn't confirm or deny anything I saw.

&#x200B;

Well, me and Laura end up hitting it off (I'm also a straight female, so not trying to slide in). She brings up the fact that I used to be friends with the girl she suspects her boyfriend cheated with. Ashley was there and gave me a, ""Don't say shit,"" look, but I cracked. I couldn't keep that in and just straight up lie to her face.

&#x200B;

Obviously, she was upset but she thanked me for telling her. Ashley was pissed at me, she immediately locked herself in her room and started texting Jake informing him of what I did and all Hell broke loose.

&#x200B;

Ashley also warned me that I shouldn't have said anything because all I did was start shit between Chris and Laura.

&#x200B;

I also informed Laura that Jake and Ashley were also aware of the cheating and lied to her every time she asked.

&#x200B;

Pretty soon after, Jake and Chris were slandering me, saying that I'm ""crazy"" and trying to start shit and that I've always been ""jaded"" and how they thought that after this year-long break that I took that I was, ""Not crazy anymore, but I guess we were wrong."" That hurt, because I've been going to counseling and really put in an effort to not be ""crazy.""

&#x200B;

Chris also denied the cheating that I was witness to for 5 months.

&#x200B;

I don't think what I did was wrong per se, but I do feel like I might be *in* the wrong for coming back into this friend group for no less than a month and basically wrecking it overnight with the truth.

&#x200B;

The only reason I said anything was because Laura was starting to tell me that she was glad that we met because she thought I was ""real"" and ""cool"" and wanted to hang out more. I have previously been cheated on and in a situation where everyone knew, but me, and I felt like an idiot. So, I sympathized with Laura.

&#x200B;

What do y'all think? I already apologized to them for causing a riff, but explained my position of being uncomfortable with lying to Laura like they've been doing for a year.

&#x200B;

They're no longer talking to me, though.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Got back into a friend group that I was gone from for a year, immediately found out they were lying to one friend about her boyfriend having not cheated on her during the period I was actively friends with them and decided to tell the truth. Now all except her are mad at me.

&#x200B;

Edit: Added fake names for clarity.

Also want to explain that the only reason I started talking to them again was because I had a conversation with one of them that led me to believe that things had changed over the past year and that everyone had grown as people. I've since learned that's not true.

So for the past 2 years we sort of acted like we were together, saying I love you to each other, talking to each other like we were in a relationship, etc. I knew that we weren?t together and it always bothered me that we acted like we were but I was so in love with him that I didn?t want to ruin what we had.

2 weeks ago he left for training for the army and I left on vacation aboard with my family. All of a sudden he told me that he was talking to a girl and that he felt guilty. I was heartbroken and suggested that we stop talking and cut ties. After I said this I regretted it, and tried to reach out and talk to him again so we talked like friends.

834,secretlyshashy,[new],10,c6070m,3,"I\[F23\] met him\[M23\] on tinder shortly before we both graduated from college. We spent a lot of time together and grew extremely close in a short period of time. He is technically my ?first boyfriend? although I have had one sexual experience with another guy in college. I have always been very shy. He told me that he planned on moving away for grad school right away and I was OK with that. He invited me to go with him and I took the chance. I relocated to the west coast to live with him and have been living here for almost a year. Although he is busy with his super intense grad program we are doing well as a couple. He is very loving and affectionate towards me. If anything he spoils me since I live in his student housing while searching for secure employment. His grad school stipend has kept us afloat thank goodness.

One potential red flag is his relationship with his family, particularly his mother. He pretty much openly dislikes her and finds her extremely annoying. He is vocal about his feelings and avoids any communication with her as long as possible because she ?asks too many questions?. I think she was really strict about weed and drinking when he was a teen. His family isn't religious or anything like that. Although he is not financially supported by his parents anymore, they help him out at times and seem to manage his bank accounts. He reaches out to his mother about money related matters and not much else. I think it is sad but I understand that some people simply don?t like their family for various reasons. I have met his mother twice and she was very friendly and normal to me. She even accommodated us and our dog during the holidays last minute but my boyfriend prevented me from interacting with her the entire time (3 weeks). So I barely spoke to her or any of family while staying in their home. Perhaps he was guarding me from her crazy side.

Sometimes he can be very petty about it too. Like during the holidays we attended a large family/friend gathering at his parent?s house.When his mother?s back was turned, he quickly took a heavy puff of his juul in front of her while his friend took a photo. They posted it on IG as a joke because she dislikes anything related to smoking. I can see how he thought that was funny since she is so anal about smoking, but it seemed fucked up in hindsight. I honestly really disliked that. He needed up deleting the photo.

He denies any history of trauma, abuse, neglect, or untreated mental illness. He grew up middle class and comfy but not rich (like me).As far as drug use, we both smoke weed pretty heavily (legally) and he has been taking his daily prescription of Vyvanse since freshman year of college for ADHD.

What could this all mean down the line? Do some people just dislike their parents or is there always an underlying problem that shows up down the line?

A couple of months ago, I went on a vacation where I quit nicotine (yay!), but this resulted in huge mood swings, a general negativity, and a lack of desire for any sort of human interaction. So I decided to start playing an online game to pass the time when I wasn't at work.   


After about another 3 or so weeks, I was feeling a lot better, but I had already developed a new habit/addiction. I would play for hours on end per day. I would put off my extra-curricular hobbies by making excuses about pain, sickness, work, etc, but end up just playing the game instead. It's also one of those games with ""dailies"", quests or objectives that you can do once a day that it makes you feel obligated to do or else you'll fall behind. So I ended up meeting this girl at a party and we hit it off pretty immediately, I got her number, bing badaboom, we start dating.  


So things are going alright, she thinks I'm the person I told her I am. The person before all I did was work and play video games. She would ask about my extra-curricular hobby, I would give her the same excuses, ""Oh I have too much work to do"". She was so supportive about it, she knew I would knock my work out of the park. This just made me feel like shit.  


So I did what any normal person would do in the situation where they're wasting their life away, and have someone supporting them to be the person they want to be. I break things off with the supportive sweetheart so I can indulge in self-destructive behavior. After all, how can I ""feel a spark"", when I'm too busy trying to hide who I've become to someone who thinks I am who I used to be.  


The next couple of weeks, I try to piece together why I didn't like her, she's sweet, beautiful, smart, funny. I start going out and getting blackout drunk on weekdays, and being just all-around depressed and started to realize that I need to talk to her to apologize/clear the air, because I did her wrong.  


We end up at a mutual party, I talk to her and clear things up and we're actually pretty good, but man, I just wanted to spend the entire party talking w/ her. After the party, she invited me out with her friends. Now this was a good 12 hours after the party started, and in all the anxiety trying to get the opportunity to talk to her, I had forgotten to eat, drank a lot, and was completely exhausted. I didn't even think before ordering the ride-share. Other than falling asleep at the place, it was really nice.  


I've realized after that what I had said above, I was ashamed of who I had become, and rather than own up to it or try to be better, I found it easier to break things off with her. I've since taken steps to fix things, I quit the game that was eating my life, I started working out a bunch, and I'm on good terms with her.  


I want to try again, I want to take things slower, spend time really getting to know each other better this time, instead of rushing into shit and trying to hide things.  


We are planning on hanging out again in a week and a half 1-on-1 for the first time since we were dating.

My question:   


Should I call her and spill out pretty much everything I said above and let her know I'm interested in trying things again slower and with a better head on my shoulders? I just don't want her to stew over this time as to what my intentions are, or to be caught off-guard if I tell her then. I feel like she deserves to know exactly what she's agreeing to, because she has plenty of reason to turn it down altogether based off my previous actions.  


TL;DR:  


I was insecure about who I'd become, and instead of trying to be better, I dumped her so she couldn't find out and so I wouldn't have to come to terms with it. Now I had to come to terms with it, and realized I made a mistake, made an effort to better myself and want to try again.

837,untilcomplete,[new],7,c601hm,1,"This is the longest, most serious relationship I've been in, my first in my 20s (so not just teen hormones), and I feel like I need outside perspective from people who are more experienced to weigh in on whether or not I'm throwing it away for stupid reasons or if I'm making the right choice. Thanks in advance. I'll try to keep this short.

I should start by saying he's a good, smart guy and we have similar philosophies about life. We can have a conversation about anything. He's respectful, cares about my goals and passions, makes me laugh, and we have a close, comfortable bond. I'm beginning to doubt our long term compatibility, though, and here are my biggest reasons:

1. Our education trajectories seem pretty different. I'm on track to transfer to a four year university within a couple semesters and then I want to attend grad school. He's been attending community college classes sporadically for nine years and isn't sure when/if he wants to transfer, what he wants to major in, or whether he's planning to take courses in the fall, which starts in two months. It kind of concerns me that he still hasn't made any major educational decisions after almost a decade in school.
2. He doesn't know what he wants to do for a career. Every spring, when the school year ends, he has a crisis about whether he even wants to have a career and whether any career will fulfill his ultimate goal of helping people and making the world a better place. It usually lasts for about a month and he'll stop talking to me for days at a time while he sulks and morosely mulls over his future. It's happened every year since we got together, and conveniently, it happens right around my birthday and he's managed to make my birthday kind of a drag every year.
3. His friends bother me. They're all his age and older, and with the exception of a pair of sisters who are nurses, they all seem to be suspended in permanent adolescence. Everyone works part time and spends the rest of their time getting high/wasted while living at home. I don't think there's anything wrong with living with your parents while you save up to move out, since that's what I'm currently doing, but these people are in their 30s or close to it. Some of them even have degrees, but don't want to get full-time gigs because that would impinge their ability to do whatever they want. They all use each other for stuff and they've started using me, too. We like to go camping, and I've noticed on the last couple of trips that no one brings any food, water, or firewood except for me. This wouldn't bother me as much if they offered to chip in for the cost, but no one does, even when I ask directly. (They'll have forgotten to bring cash.) I brought this up to my boyfriend before our most recent trip and his response was basically ""you don't have to bring anything if you don't want to."" So I didn't - I brought food for myself, expressed that it was for me, and they all STILL ate it because surprise, no one had brought anything. Boyfriend apologized to me in private, but I was pretty mad and told him I don't want to go camping with them anymore.
4. His family's a mess. His parents are acrimoniously divorced and his dad started his do-over family right around when I first started dating my boyfriend. He's admitted to me that his dad used to be physically abusive toward him and his mother. One of his sisters is a violent narcissist who's been arrested for assaulting her boyfriends. All three of his siblings and him still live at home with their mom. Their mom steals money from all of them and pits them against one another for personal gain. It's a little disturbing.
5. His adulting skills are kind of lacking. He doesn't drive, never got his license, and I do all of the driving in our relationship. He's never lived on his own before. He doesn't get haircuts or buy clothes when he needs them, even when his shoes are quite literally falling apart and he gets talked to at work for wearing clothes that are ripped or dirty. He gets mad when I buy stuff for him because ""he can buy his own clothes."" I've sort of given up on that front.
6. This is one that I've been told is inevitable in long term relationships, but our chemistry is sort of gone. I love him in the way that I love any close friend, but we aren't physically affectionate anymore, and we don't have sex more than once a month, tops. He doesn't initiate anymore, either. We barely hug. It makes me sad.

Is this stuff that gets better over time? Are these things I should compromise on? He really is my best friend and minus the stuff above, I do like being with him. My parents haven't offered much in the way of guidance here (they're divorced, my mom has sworn off relationships, my dad doesn't talk about feelings period) and I don't know what's supposed to be a normal amount of problems.

I was suddenly hit with the 'maybe we should break up' card then. He said he felt happy with me but happier alone, so we broke up for a few hours but then we talked face to face and he asked me if I had any questions, this was when he told me why. He ended up crying by the end of it and said he didn't want to break up. The only reason he gave me is wanting to be alone. I have told him many times before just to tell me if he needs space but he said he didn't want me to feel 'unwanted' because he needs so much. Of course, I ended up telling him the same thing again, just tell me you want space instead of jumping to leaving me everytime.

When I was on tinder prior to meeting him, I guess you could say I was quite adventurous. All meaningless hookups I had on the go. When my partner and I became exclusive, I deleted tinder and whatnot, but the lads who still had other means of contact would message and I'd always reply with, ""sorry seeing someone now"". I am not in contact with anyone during my tinder phase. My partner was a little surprised with how often I'd get a message, but he appreciated that i'm loyal to to him now. 

However, sometimes curiosity gets the best of me, and I redownload tinder just to see if these lads are on there or if they have disappeared because they've potentially settled down. (I do this by checking if their messages are still in my inbox thing or not). I sometimes read through my previous conversations just to cringe or giggle at the outrageousness of it all. I never 'activate' myself, so nobody can swipe me or talk to me. It's almost like I use tinder as a scrapbook for that stage in my life. 

Every time I do this though, I feel slightly guilty because I always do this behind my partner's back. Honesty is super important to me, but I feel like he might find it to be a stupid reason to redownload tinder. I fear he might think I have other motives for downloading it again. I think like it's harmless fun I do for myself, but is this bad of me? Should I stop?

UPDATE: thanks so much for your comments. I really appreciate you guys pointing out that it's kinda fucked up. I did some journaling to try figure out why I tend to do this, which was fairly successful. Now i'll be working on myself, talk to my partner and work on a few things in our relationship.

842,plantmystery,[new],2,c5zv4h,1,"My boyfriend and have been together for 4 years and have lived together for 2 of those years. He is the sweetest, most affectionate person I've ever met. When we met I was blown away with how well we got along, it felt like I'd already known him for years. He's very smart, charming and (usually) knows exactly what to say. I like to consider myself reasonably intelligent but I have some memory problems (not clinically diagnosed, I just don't have a great short term memory). I guess that's where my issue starts.  


When we first met our current landlord, my boyfriend made a comment about our previous landlord that vaguely painted her in a bad light. Basically, he said that she was difficult to get ahold of and he only had her phone number because it was written on the wifi router. This is partially true because she was sometimes hard to communicate, and the wifi router did have her phone number on it, but it was given to us when we moved in.  After we left the building, my boyfriend essentially bragged to me that he told that story to make our previous landlord look like an unreliable source for information. That way, if she gave us a bad review the current landlord would be more likely to side with us because she knows us and was set up to view our previous landlord as unreasonable/odd. I said that seemed really calculated but I didn't push the issue because until then he hadn't done anything that seemed blatantly manipulative. 

A few months later we had an incident were I was sitting on his lap while we were sitting one couch. We were talking, and he was holding me with his arms and I was cradled on top of his legs . He then opened his legs, put his arms up behind his head and I ended up on the floor between his feet. Really it was only a 2 foot drop, it didn't hurt. I was upset because we'd recently talked about not putting me down directly on the ground (floor cat hair and allergies don't mix well). Anyway, when I got up I said ""we talked about putting me on the floor, don't do that"", and he just denied it: ""I didn't try to drop you, I was trying to pull you closer"". I told him that was pretty much the exact opposite of what I saw, and I asked him why he would pull his leg and arms away from me if he was trying to pull me closer. He just said ""I don't know"". We went back and forth for a while, and then he started crying a bit and asking ""why don't you believe me?"". After about an hour of going in a circle I told him I believed him and apologized just to get out of the conversation. None of it made any sense and I was drained. 


After this I started writing down what actually happened during our bigger disagreements so I'd know for sure what happened. I started to realize I was giving him the benefit of the doubt really often because I couldn't remember exactly what happened on the spot and his version of events usually made sense or atleast sounded good enough. I started to catch him out on small lies, like whether he'd wiped down the counter or eaten food that I was pretty sure I hadn't opened. 9 times out of 10 I'd let it go, but when I'd actually question him on it he would usually find a way to turn it on me. He always seemed so sure of himself that I couldn't tell if I was just confused or not because I wasn't writing down every single thing we did. 

We'd been going on like this until about a month ago. The big incident was when I came home from a night out with my friends. Although I'd been drinking, I remember everything that happened from when I was out to when I went to sleep. My boyfriend had initially wanted to come out with us but it was a girl's night out and I told him so. He said he was disappointed but that was it. When I came home he made me food, I showered and went to bed. 


The next morning I came out into the kitchen and one of my potted plants (on the other side of the room) had been pulled up and placed, dirt and all, on the middle of the counter. There was soil everywhere. I woke up my boyfriend and asked what happened.  He told me he didn't know what I was talking about, and that I must have done it when I came home the night before. I told him that made no sense because I don't remember doing it, I didn't blackout at all, and he was with me until we were asleep. He then told me I must have done it after we went to bed. I told him that also made no sense because I remember going to the washroom in the night and coming back to bed, not pulling up one of my own plants. I've never been drunk enough in my life to do anything close to that and not remember it. He then said ""well, if you didn't do it and I didn't do it, then someone must've broken in"". He spent the rest of the day inspecting the house for forced entry. When he didn't find anything missing, he was back to square one, saying that I must have done it. 


That weekend I decided to move out for a bit to get some space. When I told him, we spent hours crying and discussing everything. He apologized and admitted that his interaction with our current landlord was manipulative, and to denying the obvious truth when he dropped me because he was ashamed and didn't know how to handle it. But he's still insisting that he didn't pull up the plant intentionally, and believes someone must've broken in to mess with us or he did it when sleepwalking. I want to believe him so badly but it just doesn't make any sense.


Since then he's fixed 90% of our other problems (cleaning up after himself, listening to me, telling small lies, etc.) and is trying to earn my trust back by treating me better. But it's just gotten more painful because I don't know if there's any coming back to where we were before all of this. I know he's trying very hard to treat me better and get me to move back to our apartment, but it's just all so confusing. How can I decide for myself if it's worth rebuilding? And if I decide it's worth it, where do I even begin with actually taking him at his word again?

843,rynrchn,Non-Romantic,8,c5zsul,2,"20M. Earlier this year I met a 21M friend at an academic conference, and he got really clingy after that because I was willing to listen to him talk about the stuff he was passionate about, i.e. environmental issues and engineering. But now he texts me way too much - literally every day he would send me multiple articles to read. Like ok he's a great guy and I appreciate our friendship, but I don't have the time or energy to text or read every one of those articles every day.

The thing is, he's on the autism spectrum, and from my conversations with him I get the impression that he doesn't have many other people to talk to, so I don't want to shut him down. Plus, I think it's really rare to find someone as genuinely passionate about something as he is, and I do think he'd make it far in life if he follows through with his passion. So it'd feel really wrong to tell him to text me less. Already I'm taking very long (\~1 day) to reply him, but his enthusiasm hasn't really died down.

TL;DR: All family members have strained relations with each other, me included. A few nights ago I held my mother in my arms as she cried and it made me reflect on the situation. I decided I wish to remedy this and have a better relationship with her, but I have absolutely no idea how to do this.

&#x200B;

Too long, but I want to read version:

&#x200B;

I suppose I should give some context first: my family was a seemingly normal middle-class family, father, mother, elder son (That's me) and younger daughter (Only a year younger than me), however a few years ago everything fell apart when my parents divorced. My father managed to retire at a rather young age (46 years old) and decided that he didn't want to end up like his father, who at of his life was suffering from severe Alzheimmer's, and thought he should keep working, and so he did. However to account for his new job, he had to make lots of investments and had to move to a nearby city, my mother closed her old business and rented the place to follow him, while me and my sister stayed as we were attending college at the time. Things were working out fine at the beginning, we moved to new, better apartment, got a new car, had money to spend, living by ourselves thought us how to be more responsable (I discovered my talent for cooking at that time, something I'll be forever thankful), but after about 2 years everything started falling apart: my father's new job had him hiring some of his friends, one of them who embezzled huge amounts of money and fled to USA, leaving my father in a huge debt, one he started paying by using the family savings, all this while lying to us. He left me, my sister and my mother in debt, sold my mother's old place behind her back and had an extra-marital affair on top of it all. When my mother found out however, she decided not to press charges. All of this understendably left a bad taste in everyone's mouth and it ended with them divorcing and me and my sister living with our mother, all the while unable to keep going to college because we had no means of paying the bills. That was about 5\~4 years ago.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this year, things are much better now. Me and sister returned to college at the start of the year, we all have cars to go wherever we need to, we are working part time on my mother's new business to have some cash for ourselves (Not enough to save and buy anything expensive, but it allows us to live confortably), I personally got out of an incredibly toxic relationship that ruined my mental health (Still dealing with some of the scars, but it's a lot better now), started a new, much better relationship with another girl and adopted another cat (When you feel like you're alone amidst your own family, an animal companion can do wonders). Semester is now done and I passed all my classes with excellent grades. However, the sheer stress we all went through strained our relationships with each other, which weren't really that great to begin with. Me and my sister never got along, my sister and mother fight constantly and I still resent my mother for her part in our financial situation going to shit. I'm the only one who still speaks with my father, and only sometimes as he is now starting a new family.

&#x200B;

Ok, now that the fluff is out of the way, on to the situation at hand: a week ago my mother arrived home and hugged me, as she does sometimes (She is very affectionate and emotionally dependant). How I'm by no means an unfeeling stoic cartoon character, but I usually never respond affection from my family in kind, initially because of resentment when I was younger and nowadays out of habit I suppose. Now I don't know if it's because my girlfriend's family is making me work this out with them or anything else, but this time, I hugged her back, firmly. Well then, she started sobbing uncontrolably and I just kept on hugging. We had a brief talk afterwards, she said she has been going to therapy and only started because of me (I study Psychology, and I do remember once talking with her about the importance of therapy). I must have spent hours in my bed thinking to myself and questioning my while life up until that point. My mother, who I always felt ignored literaly everything I ever said because she had this weird thing of treating me like a child well after puberty ended, who I always thought was too dumb to have a family, who was the only one present who I could lash out in anger for the situation we found ourselves in. My mother, who for the first time in years, I felt like I loved her. For the first time I'm starting to consider a future in which I can actually feel confortable in keeping in touch with her after I move out. Hell, I just came back from the market because she forgot to buy food for breakfast tomorrow and bought her favorite chocolate.

&#x200B;

But I want to be more proactive at this. I've been thinking in taking her out with my girlfriend to eat sushi (she loves it), but other than that and realizing I think with my stomach, I'm completely out of ideas.

I haven't had any sexual desire lately, sex has just been another chore. He hasn't done anything, we've never even had a big fight. I think something in me has just changed which is part of growing up, and being the age I am I've been doing lots of that. It's solely me that's the problem which makes me feel really guilty for feeling this way. I've missed out on a lot as I dropped out of school when I met him and basically became his house wife. I don't have family to rely on and help me nor many friends who could understand or care. I need someone to talk to so I can make the right decision or figure out how to end it. The truth is I want to love him like I used to because he's really cool, but I'm scared I can't and I don't want to be with him forever.

846,Zolku,[new],4,c5zp62,1,"Ok, so, a little bit of context:

When I as 20 years old I went to college on another state 1.000km away from my parents home. In my second year there I met this girl, the chemistry was kinda instant, we changed stares on the hallways, that kind of thing, but she had a boyfriend at the time and I was also with another girlfriend.

Fast forward 6 years, I was single again for 2 years now and so was she, I had dropped out of college after 4 years, went trough a lot of changes and had just sold a Cafeteria near the university that I had bought with some inheritance money and worked on for a whole year. I had just decided to move back to my parents house a 1.000km away after living alone in another state for nearly 7 years. Just exactly 1 week away from me moving back, me and this girl started talking on Instagram, it turns out she also went back to her parents house and bought a bar in the small town she's from, so we had a lot in common, we quickly fell in love and now 1 year have passed and here we are, officially together for quite some time now, even tho we live so far apart we have manage to see each other a few times, she came over and I also went over there, we make do how we can.

For like a month now things are not as good as it used to be, the bar the owns is not doing good and she's closing doors, selling all the stuff as she can, on top of that, her grandma is really sick, she's blind, deaf, can't walk and needs attention 24h, she has spent a few nights awake on grandma duty this last weeks. So because of all that, last time we saw each other was at the end of March, 3 months ago, and most of the times I call her she says she's busy, or has someone over or whatever and we can never talk, I miss being close to her.

But I think the core of the problem is, since I came back to my mom's a year ago now, I haven't been able to find a job, I pretty much spend my days sitting in front of the computer playing games and watching videos, I don't have any money so I don't go out and I have strafed away from the last few friends I had here, I guess I put it upon here all my attention needs sorta, and with all that's going on over there I think she's had enough, but I have asked to go over there and help her many times, to work at the bar for her, to be help her with her grandma, even drive her wherever she needs, she always refuses, she says me being there is gonna be one more thing for her to deal with.

I love her, with all my heart, I really do, I want to make it work, to grow old with her and have kids and live a happy life besides her, that's what I want the most in this world.

Today we started a heavy conversation on text, she kinda put all the things in perspective, she's at work now and she's gonna call me when she gets home so we can talk, I think this is it Reddit, what can I do to show her that we can work and that I'm capable of adapting and making it easy and enjoyable on her?

I say 2nd step dad because my siblings father was my first step dad. Anyway my 2nd SD being my siblings 1st SD seems to always vent in front of my siblings when they?re getting in trouble and it makes them feel worse. I do not appreciate this for two reasons 

1. My 1st stepdad never got in the middle of my mom and I. He would always says just listen to your mom or it?s ok your ok I got you. 
2. Clearly stepdad 2 doesn?t have authority or anything over my siblings. 
3. The things he says aren?t supportive they?re always very aggressive and can hurt peoples feelings. ( he is Latino from sinaloa & my siblings and I suffer from depression & suicidal thoughts so I know the things he says hurts. ) he will says things in Spanish that more or less translate to ? its because she doesn?t have a brain .. it?s because she?s stupid ... it?s because she?s a failure...? like he just straight up says those things. 

My issue here is I?ve told my mother many many times that he should NOT say those things in front  of my siblings. He isn?t the parent. She argues that he pays the rent for us and while we don?t say it we do appreciate the roof over our head, but he still is NOT the father figure. I don?t think he?s trying to be either, but he definitely doesn?t think before saying things. 
My mother gets very offended by me telling her to have him give her advice or vent his feelings on situations when they?re by themselves. She says she doesn?t care, but she always ends up crying when my siblings run away from home or make self harm comments. 

My sister, brother and I all have daddy issues. Their dad has been deported and is a drunk. Is a great guy when sober but he is currently in South America drinking his life away. They?re going through a lot. At this point my brother takes it better than my sister. My dad was just a distant piece of shit. Point is we aren?t looking for another father figure. They?re attached to their dad as well i am. Their dad was so great to me. I was like one of his own. 

I don?t know how to get my mother to understand that her husband needs to keep his words to himself.

849,Dskha323,[new],13,c5zmr3,0,"I met her about six months ago. Pretty quick I had a feeling she wasn?t right. I haven?t dated for over two years and was feeling lonely. Still, she was ideal for my case. She was young, religious, and we had the same cultural background. I loved the idea of her and I working out. 

The thing is I?m more of a laid back guy, as where my wife is more on the ?out there? side. Meaning she doesn?t mind being the center of attention-that sort of person. There is nothing wrong with that, but I?m just naturally not into those type of girls. I just usually dated the shy girl. Anyways, I continued to date her. Around a unusual two months our parents met. I tried ending things with her during these two months. But she said I was being over dramatic about any issue we had, and in my mind I agreed and deemed myself emotionally challenged. I would get back together with her.

Around three months our parents met and we decided to get married on our six months. This was a rough time and I tried to relationship a couple of times. Again, she talked me into staying by saying I was just being dramatic. She may have been right at times, but I knew the bigger isssue was that we just weren?t compatible. I was creating smoke screens to leave. 

Now we are married - just to note, how we are religiously married, not legally. It?s still a big deal, we had a reception and all. Now, I?m emotionally checked out. We still have times where we argue. I tried ending things this past weekend. She said I need to find a new job that pays more. I?m a student getting my B.A in one year and I also plan on going to law school.

I told her I?m content with my job. It pays 19.50/hr and I work full time. I definitely wouldn?t mind a job that pays, and I am going to try. But I was upset that she didn?t accept me for who I was. She apologized later about it, but brought it up twice to me.

I feel like she?s self centered but ofcourse there is two sides of the story and I?m not perfect. I tried breaking up with her many times. I?m sure this may have hurt her. I?m not always understating and can get emotionally detached. 

The big issue here is I feel like we aren?t compatible and idk wth to do. We can?t just break up. We can?t just get a divorce (a religious divorce). She doesn?t even live with me. She also keeps pushing up the date to love in. She says it?s because of work reasons. I no longer have the drive to make this work. And I don?t want to make my wife feel like I?m taking her for granted.

850,smithcamille92,[new],8,c5zlrh,2,"It's a long story but I'll try and summarize it as best I can. This relationship started off with lots of love. We knew each other for 5 years and were best/good friends before we began dating each other. Since then everything has been slowly going downhill.

He got me a job at his firm which is where I currently work. I got to meet his female coworker (let's call her Kathy) who was also a good friend of his and knew him for just as long as me. I was excited to meet Kathy, as she was the only other person I would kind-of know at my new job. Kathy outright ignored me at work and dodged every attempt of mine at being friends, which I respected. I left her alone. However whenever my boyfriend and I were together, Kathy would pretend like everything was okay between us just to talk to him which was super weird. Most employees in this firm live in one apartment building, and Kathy would let herself into my boyfriends apartment whenever she wanted, doors were usually unlocked. She would ask him to do all her favours like jumpstart her car, and pick her up from the other side of the city, drive her to get something to eat, etc... and my boyfriend would do all of this for her. Whenever I told my boyfriend about how she was treating me, he would do nothing, or calm me down temporarily but say nothing to her. I eventually had to ask him to unfollow her on social media and for them not to talk because it got so bad for me that she wasn't respecting my relationship. He didn't do this himself. It felt bad even that I had to ask and he didn't just stand up for me on his own. I wish he had told her off so I felt like I meant something to him at least.

Anyways after fighting about Kathy for months, he does other things which really worsened the hurt. He invited another girl (Kathy's friend, who broke up with her boyfriend that SAME DAY) to sit with him alone in his car really late at night, this was about 2am and he didn't tell me about it. The only reason I found out was because the other girl put it on her snapchat story. A bunch of other little things of similar nature happened during this time which I cannot write here because it would take me years.

The part that really hurts is recently: I thought we were in a good place/solved all of our issues surrounding his need for attention from other women. He decided to go to on vacation with his friend a month ago. On this vacation, our relationship was going well, and I was texting him super nice things like ""I love you, I hope you have a great trip & stay safe. Don't worry about texting me all the time, just enjoy your stay! I'll talk to you when your days end. xo"". And I would study for my exams. I went through his phone one day to find out that on this vacation he sent a message at 2am to a girl he used to have a ""thing"" with. They somewhat dated. And he was reminding her of a sexual conversation they had once. She didn't respond to this message, she just changed the subject and then stopped responding but it really hurt my feelings that he would do this. I confronted him about it, and first he was angry that I went through his phone (which I realize was wrong, but it came from a place of extreme mistrust, and I feel this is not healthy for me as I was never the type of person to breach somebody's privacy before.) Then he said he didn't remember sending her this message, and that he didn't mean to remind her of a sexual conversation.

Every time something like this happens, he always uses the excuse that ""he didn't know""/""it was an accident""/""I am misunderstanding the situation""/""he can't remember"". And we agree to a clean slate... but whenever I go home I never feel any better. I feel guilty bringing up the same topics to him over and over again because it's always causing fights after we agree to ""forget and move on"". But I always feel paranoid that he's up to no good and I don't know what to say to him to get some kind of closure that he won't do this to me again. He always convinces me he loves me by reminding me he got me a job, and took me on vacations, and wants to marry me and etc. But then later when I'm on my own and I think about it, I never feel like I can't forget about the things that happened. We recently have to move in together because of our job, and I would love to feel happy about such a milestone, but instead all I feel is nervous/on edge/paranoid. Is this my own insecurities ruining my life?

854,kokoromelody,Personal issues,26,c5zknm,20,"A little backstory: my younger sister and I are 9-10 years apart (depending on what time of the year it is). We had two very different childhoods; my parents and I are first generation immigrants to America, and so we went through a lot of hardship to get to the place where we are now. My sister grew up when my parents were very financially stable and had a much more lenient childhood than I did, being the secondborn and also given the fact that my parents were older. We have never been particularly close given the age difference, as I moved out for college several hours away from home and then started working full time in a different city right after. She started college this year at a school in my current city, so we have seen each other semi-frequently for meals and outings, which I typically covered as the older sibling. Her tuition and living expenses are fully covered by my parents, and she did not work at all during the school year.

Back in February of this year, the topic of her summer came up and I (albeit stupidly) offered to let her live with me in my current apartment for the summer, provided she had a job this summer that would keep her busy and let her earn some money. I bought my own 2BR condo several years back and recently finished paying off my mortgage. As this is one of the most expensive cities in the country (her getting her own place for the summer would have been very expensive), she and my parents agreed. I encouraged her throughout the months to apply to all types of places and internships, especially ones near my apartment as it would make her commute much easier. May rolled around, however, and she barely had gotten any interviews much less a job. I agreed to let her move in nonetheless, thinking she would put in more effort now that she didn't have school to keep her occupied, but she after several weeks, she still hadn't even managed to get one job interview set up. This was especially frustrating as I'm extremely busy (I work full-time in finance and have a side-gig that takes up about 30-40 hours a week on top of my job). I asked her after several weeks in how many applications she had sent out, and she had told me 20 in total. Twenty applications over 3-4 weeks is less than one a day, which angered me - she had nothing else to do during the day, and from what I could tell during the limited hours I was home, she spent most of her time playing video games and talking/video chatting with her new  boyfriend.

This eventually culminated in an argument several weeks ago where our parents were pulled in and everyone became emotional. My sister ended up packing her suitcase and bag and taking a bus home to where my parents live (about 4-5 hours away) the next day, at their encouragement, where she'll stay for the rest of the summer. She has not responded to any calls or texts from me, despite the fact that I've asked her to talk about things. My parents are doing their best to not take sides, but from my perspective, they're giving her an easy out. I don't know if I should continue to try and reach out to her; while I accept some responsibility for the argument, I don't believe my expectations were unreasonable, especially given the fact that she didn't hold up to her end of the bargain (and didn't seem to be trying to).

tl;dr I agreed to let my younger sister move in with me for the summer, as long as she got a job during that time. She did not, but I let her move in with me regardless.

Basically, my boyfriend loves me romantically, but isn?t romantic towards me. 

According to him, he used to be very romantic in his previous relationships. However, while he expected to be more romantic towards me when we first started dating, it didn?t happen. 
He unconditionally loves me, we have good relationship - we have fun together, have great chemistry/intimacy, we?re both very supportive of eachother, etc.  He is all around an amazing boyfriend, even without the love letters, flowers, or boxes of chocolates. 

During a conversation we had last night, my boyfriend told me that, though our relationship has been the least emotional (in terms of acting romantically towards the other person) in comparison to the rest of his relationships, has been the most mature relationship he?s ever been in. He says that being with me feels like home. 
Regardless, he?s told me many times that feels really bad about it, and both of us are confused as to what?s causing it. He thinks it may be because of his depression, which has gotten worse since college, and that he?s matured since his last relationship - which ended three years ago and was a very toxic relationship. He says that it made him changed his perspective on life and dating a good bit, and that it caused him to be more cautious about letting his emotions control him. 

I wanted to reach out for an outside perspective, to see if others have experienced something similar to what my boyfriend?s going through.

He's beautiful and I had honestly never felt such a strong physical attraction to anyone like this before. We chatted a bit and he mentioned that his girlfriend (29F) of 6 years had just broken up with him and that he was moving out of their apartment soon. I saw this as an instant red flag, I know baggage when I see it so I decided I wouldn't pursue anything. The next day he ended up giving his number to our mutual friend and asked if she could pass it on to me.   
I know I shouldn't have but I started texting and we ended up going on a date shortly after. Things escalated really quickly and one date became several dates in the span of about a week, we messaged constantly and he always seemed keen to want to see me. It felt too good to be true. I told him in person and over text several times that I was worried he wasn't ready because he had just gotten out of a relationship so soon, but he kept assuring me that he was fine/back to his normal self, felt so lucky that he had met me, thought about me a little bit too often, wanted us to be a ""thing"" and that our meet up seemed too perfect to not pursue wholeheartedly.   
Things took a turn though when we both went on a holiday interstate to go to the same festival. He had booked his 10-day trip with his ex when they were still together and both of them had decided that they still wanted to go ""as friends"" because they both still wanted to go to the festival. We had organised to spend time together while we were both interstate but he ended up cancelling our plans to appease his ex. It became obvious to us both that he still wasn't over his ex like he said he was and since getting back to our home city he's told me that he doesn't feel ready for a relationship.   
I feel like he was never really interested in me and was only keen on the idea of being in a relationship again and convincing himself that he could date. I feel invalidated. I feel dumb for believing that this could have been something good or for thinking that he liked or cared about me (how could he, he barely even knew me). I feel like all the worries I had - like that he would compare his relationship with me to his relationship with his ex - came to be true and its brought up so many insecurities about being unlovable and not being good enough. I feel angry that I brought up my concerns about whether not he was ready SO MANY TIMES and even told him that I was worried about getting hurt and he assured me that everything was fine and that he was ready and I believed him.

857,,Non-Romantic,6,c5zhcb,6,"Some background information: I have been struggling with anorexia for a few years now. This year, after several attempts at recovery and several relapses, I checked into a residential treatment program. It was the best decision of my life. It gave me time to heal the damage to my body, work on the underlying anxieties, and rebuild my sense of self-worth. After leaving residential treatment I transitioned to home and am keeping up with recovery with my therapist, psychiatrist, and dietician. I'm far from fully recovered but much healthier and happier than I was this time last year.


I'm home with my parents for a while until my health is more stable and my family has been amazing and supportive, my sister included. However, she recently moved back home as well and the realities of living together with our respective food issues have begun to become apparent.


My sister has been self-conscious of being overweight since we were kids. She has openly said in the past (when she was a teenager so I don't hold it against her) that she was jealous of my ability to maintain anorexia. A terrible thing I learned recently was that while I was in treatment, our grandmother mentioned to her that it was a funny coincidence that I was working on gaining weight while she (sister) needed to lose. I think this comment hurt my sister deeply. Now that my sister is here, she's been talking about changing her diet and exercise to ""get healthy"". She's being careful not to mention weight loss around me, which I appreciate, but I know she's bought a scale so I believe she has that goal in mind. I absolutely believe it's possible to lose weight in a healthy way, but some of my sister's behaviors seem unhealthy to me.


I follow a really strict diet; 3 meals and 3 snacks daily, heavy on protein, starch, and fats. I'm still clinically underweight and need to continue weight restoration, and I've really been trying to follow my diet with fidelity. My sister has begun to eat a limited vegetarian diet and also practices intermittent fasting. Today, she ate nothing until about 3 pm, then refused to eat dinner with us afterwards, claiming that she'd ""just had lunch"". I worry that her diet is extreme. It's also (selfishly) difficult for me to sit at a table and eat when someone else is restricting and not have disordered thoughts and urges. Seeing someone omit food groups and limit calories is difficult, but I recognize that that's my baggage to deal with. However, I'm genuinely concerned that she's approaching restricting calories too aggressively; eating one meal in 24 hours on top of going to the gym seems excessive.


We've also been having some miscommunications verbally. The other night we ordered pizza, and I made what I thought was a neutral statement, ""We ordered way too much food"". I made this comment while packing up the leftover pizza, I never meant this as a judgement on anyone's personal portions. But my sister immediately snapped ""I hate when people say shit like that. It's like, okay maybe it's too much for you, but how am I supposed to feel?"". I felt terrible that my comment sounded judgemental and I tried to explain what I meant, but I was nervous and maybe didn't explain it well. She's also been looking at old clothes of hers and wistfully saying things like ""I can't believe I was ever this small"", which don't know how to respond to. Body-shame in general is something I've worked hard to banish from my mind, so comments like that bring back a lot of body dysmorphia for me. 


I feel like I'm navigating a minefield and at any moment I could say or do the wrong thing and hurt one of us. I'm worried that I'm projecting my insecurities on her and that her dieting is perfectly normal. I'm worried that I'm unintentionally supporting disordered behaviors by not saying anything. I'm worried about her disordered behaviors triggering a relapse for me. I don't know if I should confront her about this, or accept that we're both needing to work things out on our own.

I made a post a few weeks ago on this topic, but now since things have changed a little, I need some more advice.

So, I really like this girl in my grade [14f]. She is kind, intelligent, talented, and pretty. I don't really know her that well though - I have known her brother for a few years now but I only started seeing her daily this year. I have only one class with he, and we do not interact in the class. Somehow, though, I find myself thinking more and more about her everyday, and one day I remember she was laughing at a joke my friend made and accidentally locked eyes with me. I got nervous and shaky and my heart skipped a beat.

Now onto the more important stuff:

I don't really know anything about relationships. First off, my social media skills are horrendous, and I got instagram just to follow her. After getting to follow her though, I find myself constantly going through her posts and looking at her pictures. It seems like creepy stalking to me and it makes me feel horrible. I deleted instagram today because I felt like I was losing control over my feelings.

Second: I don't really know how to get to talk to her. We might have no classes together next semester because I take more advanced courses at my highschool. Should I DM her something about homework and take the conversation from there, or what? I'm pretty bad at making idle conversation and every convo I initiate seems to die down and leave an awkward silence pretty quick

Third: We have homecoming coming up when school starts, should I ask her out there? I reiterate that I don't really know her that well and it would be weird, because I am widely regarded as ""the smartest kid in my grade"" (bullshit btw) and a lot of people try to use that to make fun of me. I have to act more ""cool"" in order to not seem like a dumbass. I don't really know if it would seem weird that I, least likely of all people to have feelings for someone, suddenly asked someone out?

Lastly, but not least importantly: I have a lot of self-esteem and self-consciousness issues, and this has only made it worse. Whenever I do something now, I think, ""what would she think if I did this""? Plus I don't have the greatest looks (imo) so it has only made me feel worse about my appearance. I was never the type of person to care about appearances, and now I do. Whenever I play piano now, I think, ""maybe she would like it if I played this section right"" and it feels like I became a brand new person in order to adapt to my mental image of her.

This is a minor thing but it's making me overthink so I'd like some insight. Using a throwaway because my wife knows my main. We've been together for 6 years and have a really nice relationship overall.

My wife and I combined finances when we got married and we make a decent amount together. We're not wealthy by any means but we're comfortable. We discuss big purchases and all that and handle money decently well.

However, my wife keeps asking me to buy her little things, or at least strongly hinting at it. For example, she'll show me pictures of a ring she really likes and say ""it would be really nice if you got this for me"" or ""I'd be so happy if I got this as a gift, I really like it!""

The things she asks for are not overly expensive. I just don't understand why she won't buy them herself. I have told her to just order it for herself but she says it's not special that way. I can't tell if she's feeling guilty for spending money on herself, and if she is, I would feel bad because I have no problems spending similar amounts on my own stuff. I just don't understand what she wants and how she's feeling, but when I push the issue or ask her why she can't just buy these things for herself, she clams up and seems sad. Does anyone have any advice or insight on what the heck is going on here and how I can address it?

I'm fairly certain that I am straight because while the thought of dating a man doesn't repulse me, it doesn't excite me either. They haven't said anything directly yet but they have been asking me very personal questions late at night along with other things that make me think they love me such as non-stop compliments even when they are not deserved.

864,adabbadon,Relationships,26,c5ybor,50,"Basically I wound up in a crappy situation (see post history for more info) where I'm going to be unable to work for five weeks, nowhere to live, about $150 to my name and my boyfriend's family is very kindly taking me in for that time. My boyfriend is extremely, wonderfully supportive of me in every way. We have a fantastic, healthy relationship and I'm really bad at trusting people but I try my hardest to let myself trust him.

My mom has had a series of terrible, toxic, abusive marriages through my childhood. I clearly remember many lectures she has given me about keeping finances separate and never, under any circumstances, allowing yourself to be financially dependent on a significant other. I know, logically, my boyfriend and his family are not going to use money to control and manipulate me (like my own family does to me...that's part of why I'm in this situation). My mom is pretty upset that I'm moving in with his family instead of living at home but I can't go back to her house and my boyfriend has all but forbidden that I go back because he knows how very harmful being at home is for me.

Despite all this I still feel the urge to go back home to keep the peace with my mom and because I'm so scared of allowing myself to be financially supported by my boyfriend. His family is well off and he has a really well paying job. They regularly host exchange students so it is really no burden to them to have an extra person. I will be helping out around the house in exchange for living with them, something that I insisted upon. But the other option right now is basically going back to being under actual financial control and manipulation from my parents.

Practically every day he texts me with details about what he did that day, what he?s doing now, or what he?s going to do, and how he feels about ALL of it. He does say ?How are you?? eventually, but he gives me all this detail about his life and feelings totally unsolicited. 

In my dating experience, when you?ve only known someone a very short time, you don?t do this. You keep things light and simple.

866,littlemissstardust,Personal issues,8,c5y85i,1,"So, my dad (M51) got divorced from my mom when I was around 9. I was a very naive kid so I didn't get it, but from my brother's reaction I knew I was supposed to be upset (he was around 11, he burst out crying). All I really understood was that they were going to live in separate houses.

Not even a year later, starts dating my step-mother, who we'll call Trixie. He dated her on and off through high school and they broke things off in college. I was around 10 or 11 when they started dating, and not even another year later, they get engaged. So they dated for about nine or so months. She lived in Dallas, TX and we lived in Birmingham, AL so it was a long distance relationship until she moved in with us when I was 12.

As I got older, I started feeling kind of weird about how quickly he got with her and how quickly they got engaged. It didn't really effect my interactions with her though, so I didn't really think about it.

Cut to when I'm 12, he starts getting pissed at me for things I used to be allowed to do. It's not a situation where it's acceptable as a 9 year old but not a 12 year old, it was just like a flip of the switch. He yells at me a lot more (he always screamed at me but he didn't do it this much) and is a lot stricter. I put two and two together and realize that he started acting like this as soon as they moved in together. And the thing is, I don't think she's making him. Trixie's a very sweet person and that's why I feel bad for disliking her. But at the same time, she can be condescending and is very ""I've seen worse"" when I talk about my anxiety and ADHD (she's a teacher talking about her students). But otherwise she's very sweet and a generally pleasant person.

It's also painfully obvious he loves Trixie more than me. It's hard to be specific, but there are certain gestures and things he does that proves it for me.

Any advice on how to stop resenting her? Are my feelings justified? Also, talking to him about how he is acting is out of the question. I've tried and it didn't go well (he started blaming me). My mother also told him to cut his shit out but he just keeps doing it.

867,macbackk,[new],4,c5y708,1,"So this is a very complicated story. I've known this girl since the beginning of high school, and we became close friends. We would always spend time with each other by going to museums, watching movies, and going to Disneyland together. Over time I began to have feelings for her, and I confessed to her over a text. She never responded, and we didn't talk for a while. Over a few months, she would hit me back up and said that she missed me and wanted to rekindle our friendship. We did, and we got closer than ever before. Last summer, we would hang out all the time, and those feelings for her came back. We go to different universities, and we would try to communicate, and we would make sure to see each other whenever we had the opportunity. She would call me things like ""baby boy"" and always tell me she would miss me. We would go to an amusement park, and she would put her arm around mine and lay her head on my shoulder. Then one day, she messaged me suggesting that I should take her on a date. I was genuinely shocked about this as she always told me she never had feelings for me. Turns out the date didn't go well and she was acting very weird. I wanted to make it up and take her on another one but she just flat out ignored me. We went to drink coffee one night and she tells me, ""My parents are telling me I should give you a chance."" Then in the past couple of months, she started to ignore me more and not put too much effort into checking on me. I got very upset, and decided to stop hitting her up. Now it's summer, and her quarter at her university was coming to an end. She begins to send me memories of us two together and saying how much she misses me.

868,Sksso,Dating,8,c5y5ht,1,"So about 8 months ago I went on Tinder and met this cute girl. You know how it goes, got her number, got to talking and got to know each other. She?s 23 and I?m 26. We both agreed to keeping it casual as neither of us was ready for any committed relationship. For the last 8 months we?ve been seeing each other, we became very close but agreed to keep the terms of non-commitment. 

Throughout these 8 months we?ve argued atleast 3 times about how she felt worried that we were getting too close. I assured her that she can see other people, I?ve been doing it. We spoke every single day, I knew about her life. When the fights happened I asked her if she wanted to end this casual set up, I asked if I make her happy, she said I do and we continued forward. 

Around 2 weeks ago her work colleague was murdered. Despite the fact that they weren?t close, this affected her badly. She?s mentioned that she feels fucked up mentally and she?s not sure how she feels anymore. I suggested talking to people, but she no longer sees her friends as much. I essentially became her main confidante and friend, she told me about her ambitions, worries etc. I said she needed another outlook. 

Last week we meet up the usual Saturday, she explains what happened to her colleague. We go back to my place, she has bad allergies so I take care of her. As she?s lying on the bed she says I love you. I?m a dumbass so naturally I respond with ?I love me too? and we laugh it off. Later on I tell her I love her too. Everything is going well, we meet up at her work for lunch on Tuesday, have a good time. Thursday come around and she says she can?t make Saturday coz of money issues. I say I can pay for the food and whatever else, she says it?s a principal. I tell her we don?t see each other that much, it?s a small compromise. We end up fighting about this, she talks about how mentally she?s in a weird space and it feels like she said I love you preemptively and we?re too close. I tell her, again, that there?s still no commitment, we haven?t changed those rules, if I don?t make her happy and she doesn?t want to be around me I?ll leave. She always had the option of seeing other people. She asks if we?re on hiatus, I said if that?s what she wants, she said no. Despite this, being an idiot again, I felt weird and didn?t speak to her for 2 days. That Saturday I sent her a message saying that we I agreed with her when she said we have something good going and I also care about her a lot, we shouldn?t let this fall. She tells me it?s not that she wants to see other people, that she doesn?t want to see anyone and she thinks we need space (despite the fact that we?re still not officially together). She says she doesn?t want to be responsible for others feelings and she wants to have fun, she has no mental space right now to be with someone. I suggest a physical, FWB set up and she agrees. So I give her space.

The next day she hits me up, sends a little heart and we make small talk, despite the fact that this was supposed to be me giving her space. Tuesday I respond to her last message, and today she respond back by telling me she doesn?t want purely physical coz mentally she can?t separate our history from the sexual side of things. I ask her what this means. She maintains that she doesn?t want to hurt anybody, that she just wants to be alone. I ask her why she suddenly wants me out of her life. She says that we got too comfortable, in a way that doesn?t sit right with her, not really explaining what that means to me. I ask her what changed in the space of a few days, where we were together saying she cares about me and loves me, to this scenario. She says her headspace just flipped. I tell her that she said I love you first and made it weird considering our set up. She tells me to forget that she said she loves me. So I end off by saying she knows where I am if she wants to talk. She says we can still meet up for coffee on Saturday but she doesn?t want to mess me around. 

Sorry for the long ass essay, I?m just confused as to how, in the space of under a week she went from saying I love you to not even wanting our initial physical set up. Whenever we were together I could see how happy she was, she said I made her happy and when she thinks of a good time she thinks of me. I don?t know if we did get too close. Right now I?m just going to go on with my life but the switch up really gets to me. If it?s another guy it?s fine, coz honestly I was talking to other women coz again, we were never officially together. Anybody else go through anything like this?

869,GlitterPen15,[new],7,c5y15m,1,"So my ex girlfriend and I broke up about 1.5 years ago after a four year on/off relationship. We had decided to stay as friends with benefits. 

After more than a year of her not becoming involved with anyone else, she suddenly started sharing her blossoming feelings for her coworker, who is 27 and has a girlfriend of 8 years.

I thought nothing of it at first, but as time passed I noticed she was really bonding with the guy, and was basically set on having sex with him. 

Mind you, I met her a virgin and she had not been with anyone but me up until now. Also, this wasnt the first time she had told me about feeling close to another guy or wanting sex with someone else. For some reason this time really triggered me badly. I began questioning every little detail about her relationship with him and became extremely clingy, even going as far as asking her to get back with me. 

When I found myself leaving class early due to lack of focus, I knew something had to be done. At first, she begrudgingly agreed to be celibate for a month to give me time to get warmed up to the idea of her being with someone else. That lasted less than two days before I felt too guilty and called off the agreement. 

The next day, I took my mom's advice and told her we needed a 40 day break from each other. She agreed and I proceeded to block her. 

Now it has been 9 days and I've felt more miserable than I can ever remember. I've seen a couple of her pictures on FB and IG and she appears to be having fun with her coworkers (looking mighty stoned). 

I feel like she is acting unlike herself. I want to counsel her but I feel it is best for both of us to see this break through.

870,newaccount1025,[new],7,c5xwtk,0,"Growing up my sister and I got along really pretty well. We came from a pretty bad household and my sister moved out when she was 18, and I couldn?t blame her. Last summer when I turned 16, she offered to let me stay with her at her apartment, and it sounded a lot better than the hellhole I was in (and it is) so I jumped on the opportunity and moved in with her before school started.

She works full time, so the deal that she proposed to me is that I could stay with her for free, but I have to do the cooking/cleaning/laundry, pretty much all of the chores. And that seemed really fair to me. Things started off pretty well, but soon I realized that she didn?t treat me the same way she used to. It was almost as if she was acting like my mom in a way and she didn?t treat me like a friend like she used to. 

She made me ask her permission before I went out anywhere or did anything, and now it?s gotten to the point where I have to ask permission even just to do the chores. She also started going clothes shopping with me, and she basically dresses me herself because she only buys things for me that she approves of and thinks I look nice in, so I can?t even pick my own clothes. 

I?ve had a crush on this girl ever since freshman year, and I finally asked her out in May before school got out and she said yes. When I came home happy and told my sister, she got angry at me and told me that I should have asked her permission first, and that she can?t believe I asked someone out that she doesn?t even know. She told me to invite her over to dinner so she could approve of her, so later that week she came over and we had dinner. It was almost like an interview with how many questions my sister asked her. After we finished eating I drove her home and she asked me wtf was up with that, and I told her that my sister was just messing around and that she doesn?t normally act like that. When I got back, my sister told me that she wasn?t happy about it but she would allow me to date her.

We started dating, and things were going really well. I would typically try to find places to go other than my sister?s apartment and I was able to dodge it for quite a while until last week. My girlfriend insisted on coming over since we haven?t really hung out there before. I asked my sister, and she got frustrated at me but said I was allowed to have her over for two hours. So I told my girlfriend and she came over. We hung out and watched TV for about an hour, and then I invited her up to my room. 

We were in my room kissing, and my girlfriend had pulled my pants and underwear down when all of a sudden the door opens. My sister unlocked it with her key and barged into the room without knocking or anything. She yelled at me, saying that I didn?t ask her permission to take my girlfriend to my room and that I was in big trouble for doing so. Then she pointed at my penis and said ?Put that little thing away and show your girlfriend to the door, now? and gave me a menacing look so I listened to her. My girlfriend was in absolute shock and didn?t say a word, and once we got outside she said she was going to call a friend to come pick her up and that I didn?t need to wait around. When I went back inside my sister was furious, and told me I?m grounded for a week and I?m not allowed to leave the apartment or see my girlfriend. 

When I texted my girlfriend that night and tried to explain things to her, she called me and told me not to bother, and that she didn?t think things were going to work out between us. And then she broke up with me. I started crying and I went downstairs to where my sister was sitting and told her that she broke up with me. And my sister seemed happy, and said that I deserved better anyways, and to be glad I didn?t waste any more time on her.

I?m really furious about this. I?ve liked this girl so much for so long and my sister had to come in and screw everything up and she didn?t even apologize. She was the first girl that I truly really felt a connection with and I was really interested in, and now she won?t even return my texts. I feel like my sister is just obsessed with controlling my life and I just turned 17 so I think I can make my own decisions, I don?t need her to. I don?t know wtf to do. 

How can I make her stop acting like this? How can I get her to be reasonable and stop trying to control every aspect of my life? And I?ll just go ahead and say that living with her is much better than living back home with my parents, so that?s not even an option I?m willing to consider. I know my sister is a good person but I just need to know how to get her to stop being such a control freak.

&#x200B;

I have been with my boyfriend for two and a half years. Things have been great. Not perfect but I love him a lot and I know he loves me too. We have a great time together and he's super supportive of my work ambitions and health goals. I see a future here and he's always said he does too.

We had looked at moving in together this time last year but he didn't feel it was the right time for it. He didn't really give a lot of details but he's committed to me in every other way so I let it go. It was frustrating and confusing as he is seemingly unable to communicate his feelings. I let it go and we agreed to put it off for another year. The date we agreed on is July 31st of this year. It's coming up soon and I have mentioned it a few times casually and he kinda just shrugged it off.

Part of the reason I am wanting to move in is that I work a lot (3 jobs) and constantly packing overnight bags and taking care of my cats in between is taking a toll on me. The second and third jobs are relatively new but it was taking a toll on me even before that. On top of all of this I am trying to make time for the gym. It's burning me out and he knows this. He can't stay at my place because I have two cats and he is allergic. He stayed over twice and didn't have too serious of a reaction but there was definitely something there. In a new place, we would need a house with a basement for them, and we had looked at all the ins and outs of how to keep him safe in terms of his allergies.

I had started to look at places online just to get a sense of what could work for us. He was kind of aloof about the whole process. He wasn't showing any signs of excitement, looked at maybe one or two places online. He hasn't showed any signs of excitement in terms of thinking about decorating or what we could do for a separate space for him (he has kind of a second career he needs space for and we had decided to devote a second room).

He has looked into buying a home and did put some thought into a place my cats could co-exist but that would be about 3-5 years out reasonably. I talked to him about all of this, and the fact that I don't want to wait until he's ready to buy (if I am going to be ready, it would be about the same time frame if it's a house - I could do a condo on my own). At this point I understood it to be a target date of July 31st. I still need a lot of time to prepare but I knew it was coming and I prepared financially. I asked him the other day if he was excited about possibly buying a house together and building a life and his response was ""ya"".  Ouch.

Then last week he said he wants to wait until October. It's cold then where we are and it's definitely not ideal. He said he hasn't done any kind of planning, he won't be ready and still needs to go through a lot of his stuff. He also has a physical health concern but he knows I would do a majority of the packing - as much as I needed to. I would do anything to make his life easier. I try to come up with solutions for this, none of these are new barriers and I had expected these would be a concern, but he doesn't address any solutions I try to offer and he kind of just shrinks. He told me today that change is hard for him and he needs more time to process this. I have agreed to be somewhat flexible on the date, but I am hesitant to keep trying because he's not taking an active role in any of this. He said he hasn't had time to plan and yes - he has other stuff going on other than his full time job, but nothing that would prevent him from looking at a few places online etc. I feel really hurt that he can make time for other pursuits in his life but not this. I don't expect he would make this his only priority. But the fact that it doesn't figure at all really hurts me.

I am worried that if we agree on October this same issue will rear it's ugly head, and I am really  hurt that he has done nothing to plan this out, despite knowing how hard this constant commuting is for me. At 36 I really need to figure out what I am doing with my life. I am ready to settle down and I thought we were on the same page. I don't do well with instability and this situation has been extremely stressful on me for the last year. I just need a little bit of hope and I feel completely lost here. I love him and I want to be with him but I also don't want to waste my time.

We did talk today and he feels bad that his personality/inability to express his feelings or take action have led us to this point. I am worried that at 39 Y/O, this is too much to fix and we will always be at a standstill. I have tried several times to see if he will engage in counselling with me but he won't. Counselling is hard and I know that. I am hurt that I would fight to fix this and he just disengages completely.

At the beginning of this year I matched with this guy on Tinder. We talked and decided to meet up. We went to a movie, met a bit earlier to talk (like 30 min) and during the movie he awkwardly tried to reach for my hand. He even held it. I was SO confused as I didn?t really know him and basically ran away afterwards. 

He then texted me and asked if I felt uncomfortable and I was like uh, yes, I don?t know you... so he was like yes, I made a mistake. I did like him tho, I just thought it was too fast. Never talked again after that. 

Fast forward to a month ago, we matched again and he invited me out, this time to go dance. He never mentions any romantic intention whatsoever, just wants to practice his dance skills. I am cool with that. We both had a great time and I realized I actually like him. 

We kept on talking and we have been talking 24/7 ever since. We met again last Saturday, had a great time but nothing happened, he has made flirty comments sometimes but nothing physical past a goodbye hug. He invited me out again even though he?s in finals right now (which seems like a sign to me? Idk). Asks me about how I slept, how my day has been...

It seems like he likes me, right? But then he made a comment today saying like ?our friendship would be ruined if...?. On Sunday I made a flirty comment and he replied ?haha thanks :) non flirty comment about same topic?

So, I DON?T know what the hell to believe? Is he friendzoning me or is he too scared of being rejected -again-? I?ve been trying to be flirty but then he kinds of changes the subject. I don?t know what to do. We never addressed the ?hand issue? after that, should I?

I could also just bluntly ask him ?what are we doing here?? but it seems a bit intense. I hate mixed signals.

Any insights?

873,paranoiaenthusiast,Relationships,1,c5xq4d,2,"Sorry folks, this is gonna be a long one. 

I am having some problems with my mother at the moment, largely in regards to her behavior towards me and other people. She says things that are inappropriate at best, and outright mean at the worst. I'll start with what she says to me. I struggle with mental illness (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety), and we've had many talks about it in the past (this is important I promise). I recently turned 25, and on the day of the party was wearing a dress that didn't have any sleeves. I also was recovering from a sunburn, and was peeling. Apparently a large flake of skin (gross, I know, sorry) had dropped from my shoulder on to the floor. My mom said ""you're disgusting."" Not ""that was gross"" or ""you're peeling a lot and it's pretty gross"" but ""you're disgusting."" It was a huge hit to my self esteem and didn't ruin the evening, but certainly made me drink a lot more. There are many more smaller comments that I deal with every day that are innocuous at first, but after years of constant comments about my weight, my skin, my makeup, my room, my car, it's starting to wear on me. 

Then there's what she says to other people. My boyfriend's dad was in the hospital recently for what was originally thought to be a heart attack, but has now been determined to be a combination of dehydration and an anxiety attack. My mother, upon hearing the news of his dad being in the hospital, said ""maybe this will be a wake up call for him to take better care of himself."" My boyfriend's father is overweight, but he's healthy. And he was in the hospital for fuck's sake. This isn't the only comment she's made about my boyfriend or his family either; she comments on my boyfriend's weight, his brother's ""laziness"", etc. 

Ultimately this has made me realize that I don't really like being around her, which compounds upon the second problem: she's clingy. For some background, I had a younger brother who died of meningitis when he was a baby. I was 4 and don't remember much of it, but it hit my parents very hard. I think this is the reason why my mom is so clingy, but it's getting to be a bit much. I'm going to grad school in the fall, and she keeps coming up with ""reasons"" for me to be at home as much as possible, such as staying with my same therapist (which would make me come home at least once every two weeks) and even commuting to school, which is an hour away and would be a huge push up to pull off. The more she clings, the less I want to be around her, and the less I want to be around her, the more she clings. It's a bit too cyclical for my liking. I'm 25, at this point her love is suffocating me.

Ultimately the problem is that I can't talk with her about these things, as she gets very defensive, even confrontational, when the slightest flaws in her personality are pointed out. She's a very angry person, both at herself and other people, which makes it difficult to talk to her about these things without her accusing you of yelling at her, regardless of how softly you spoke. I am not a confrontational person, and most of our arguments end with me crying. I've tried bringing up some of this stuff before, especially in regards to my mental illness, and it goes okay at first. Then she goes back to the same old behavior, and it feels like we've gotten no where. At this point I'm tempted to give up and just limit my time with her to as little as possible, but she's my mom and she loves me, so that feels like stabbing her in the back. So, r/relationships, how do I broach this subject with her. 

TL;DR- My mom makes inappropriate, sometimes mean comments towards me and other people, is clingy because of past trauma to the point of suffocating me, and is virtually incapable of receiving criticism to the point where any condemnation of her actions is met with accusations of ""yelling"" and defensive behavior.

A moved out to live elsewhere and we got someone else to cover the lease.

We all graduated but A and i are taking summer classes to finish our degrees and i'm still living with B in the same place. But A warned me that graduation would be the last day we see each other; i, of course, thought he was overreacting. Sure i'm still living with B but we could still hang out outside my apartment. We hung out the day before graduation and he repeated the same thing, i said no we could still hang out since we're in summer school. A few days later i see that A unfollowed me on IG and unfriended me on facebook.

I haven't done anything to make him mad, i know i haven't. A said we were going to drift apart anyway and sure that was bound to happen, but that would be because of distance and over time. He apologized for all the times he was annoying or ""too much"". A also told our friend C about how i was not accepting this. I've lost friends before, but it's always been my fault, this time it's out of my control and i'm not sure how to proceed.

875,aresetbuttonplease,Dating,2,c5xlfp,1,"I really don?t want to drag this on because this is hard for me to write but here it is. 

We?ve been dating for about 9 months. We?re seniors in high school about to graduate, well, tomorrow but we?ve known each other for almost 3 years and have been on and off friends but last summer is when we finally decided to be together as a couple.

We hung out every day. Every day we had the chance to. And it was great. No arguments, worries, nothing. Just love. 

As time went on her life got more stressful and so did mine. We didn?t hang out as much, we didn?t text as much and overall we weren?t together as much as we were because of life and it sucked but it is what it was. Life happens, right? We still were great when we saw each other and still had love. 

She?s very ambiverted (both introverted and extroverted - I mean, who isn?t but she is. It?s hard to explain). She can hangout with me and her friends and be outgoing some days but some days she wants to just hangout in her house by herself and do her own thing. Which I can respect and understand, being that I?m almost the same way. I also suffer from chronic anxiety that restricts me from doing some things, and she gets that so sometimes I can?t do as much outgoing things as her like partying or hanging out at certain places with big crowds. 

She goes through a lot stress wise. I won?t get into too much detail but her family life isn?t the best. More stress than I would ever be able to handle if I?m going to be honest. 

Throughout the relationship we?ve argued, bickered and whatnot but we?ve always bounced back stronger. 

And then came the big question. College. I told her from the beginning that I don?t want to be the reason she didn?t do what she wanted to do after high school and if the relationship will have to be long distance then I?m fine with that. She agreed and said vice versa. Essentially she told me about a month ago she?s going a couple states over to study art. I said okay and that was that. 

About a week ago after I took her out to dinner for a date, and everything was fine as usual. she texted me the next day with a really long paragraph saying how she needs space from me, not because she feels suffocated but because she doesn?t know what she wants from a relationship and is confused about what she wants. 

It didn?t seem like the breakup kind of space, she still kept photos up of me and her on social media?s and in her bio and stuff. 

Her saying that paired with my chronic anxiety kept up for days. I asked myself so many questions: 

?Why is she saying this now? Out of the blue??

?Did I do something? I know I can be a piece of shit sometimes but It didn?t feel like I was doing anything wrong.? 

?Does she want to be with me still? She?s my fucking world, I love her so much. I don?t understand.? 

Etc. 

I said okay, whatever you need. But 2 days later after not talking these questions were interfering with my day to day life and I just couldn?t go on without answers. I somewhat kept pressing her about answers she didn?t want to answer yet and eventually I just said:

?I?m sorry, you know I get like this but I just have so many questions. If you need time I get it. I?ll just have to distract myself somehow. Call me or text me when you?re ready to talk, okay?? 

She hasn?t talked to me since. That was about 6 days ago. I?m okay now and still love her. I don?t know where to go from here.

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 9 months recently said she wants space to figure stuff out out of the blue. Everything seemed fine so I?m just wondering where to go next.

876,whatisbearsandbeets,[new],1,c5xjgp,1,"This is my first time posting something on this subreddit so please bear with me. Just for some background, this is my second relationship (first one was a few years ago and very toxic) and this is my girlfriend's first relationship. Honestly, this has been going on for some time. We just finished up at university and the last year has definitely taken a toll on us. Last summer and the first few months of the school year, I was very depressed with my own personal family issues - my father had had this on-and-off cancer scare throughout last year and I had been very down and negative about the situation, kind of a ""woe is me"" attitude. I was flunking some of my classes, spending all day in bed, etc. etc. It had started to rub off on her.

In November, she sat me down and told me she was tired of being taken for granted and that I wasn't putting in enough effort in the relationship, which I wholeheartedly accepted. I planned to do better. She told me she needed a break from me for a few days, but when we hung out after about a week off, I told her that I feared that she would stop loving me and we made up. I'm summarizing, but even looking back on it now, it was all very genuine. I wasn't able to fix everything right away but we improved and spent more time with each other.

Anyways, fast-forward a few months and we're in our last semester. She's started exhibiting a lot of the same behavior I was in the beginning of the school year. She's receded from our larger social circles, she's negative all the time about almost every aspect of her life. Like, she recently got a full-time offer from her dream internship and was complaining about how it was in a more boring department and that it wouldn't be as ""impactful"" anymore. I mean! It's a job, am I wrong to say that she should be a little thankful to have at least a position at this company that she's wanted to work at all her life? Especially right out of college? I don't even know, it seems like she's spinning everything that happens to her and looking at only the negatives.

Now I feel like I'm the one who is in her position - i.e. I'm the one reaching out and always asking her about her day, if she's okay, if she wants to hang out with me, what kind of dates she would like to go on. I'm the one making all of the plans. I rarely even feel comfortable telling her about my own problems and day-to-day thoughts because I'm always trying to make sure that she's okay.

I talked to her about this, asking her why I'm the one who's always planning things for us to do and she told me that while she is very independent, part of her still wants the man in the relationship to be the one making plans because that's one aspect of the ""traditional roles"" she likes. But on top of all this, she's very indecisive. So if I propose something like dinner and a movie, she doesn't let me know when she's free. It's always ""I don't know, I'll have to check."" It's almost like she wants me to set the date, but like, if she doesn't tell me when to plan stuff out, I don't know how to proceed? Like, I can't just make plans and then find out she's not free, especially when I've done my due diligence in asking her for a date and time.

Whenever I bring up being the one to text first, she'll tell me that she was ""waiting for my texts,"" which I don't understand? At this point, we've been dating for a year and a half, I don't get what's stopping her from just texting me - like why is there still some sort of formality? We've had our issues in the past but I'm always trying to make myself available to her, trying to listen and empathize with her problems and strategically trying to offer advice. She's told me in the past that she's insecure about how no one wants to be her friend. I'm someone who has a lot of friends, and she'll oftentimes get jealous of the attention I get in a group setting.

I try to offer her advice but she'll tell me that ""I don't get it."" It's to the point where she won't believe me when I tell her that there was a time when I felt like I had no friends. She just sees the current situation, and I feel like sometimes she doesn't even want to acknowledge all the groundwork and foundation I lay down to build up these friendships. I try to tell her how I do it, but she gives up or writes it off.

I've told a few of my friends about this and they think that this behavior is somewhat comparable to emotional manipulation. I don't know what to think. One quick example: Two weeks ago, we had a party and went out to the bars for a friend's birthday. This was the first time we had seen each other in a few weeks, and the last time we'd seen each other in person, we'd had a fight. But since then, our text conversations had been okay. Anyways, earlier in the day before the party, I texted her asking if she was already at her apartment at school and wanted to hang out. She told me she was moving stuff out and would see me at the party. Cool. I went to the party and she shows up. We're hanging out with other people there and talking, but things feel off. We're not ""touching"" each other, like there's even no hugging or any affectionate behavior.

We leave the party to go to the bars, and when we get there, she's not really engaging with me still. I try dancing with her but she's super stiff and doesn't show much interest. Eventually, I get kind of tired and go start dancing with everyone else. About an hour in, she comes to me and tells me that she has to go home because she has to wake up early. So I tell her I'll leave with her. She's quick to warn me that she's just going to go home and go to bed - I tell her that's fine, and that I just want to walk her home. So we leave and head to her place. I walk her all the way back and we have a bit of an awkward goodbye. She tells me to let her know when I get back to my place, so I do. I write ""home"" when I get in and she writes back ""good good."" I don't respond and ten minutes later, she writes ""well now I want to cuddle but it's too late."" I tell her I want to cuddle too and that I can still come over after a quick shower, to which she says ""no it's fine, we need to get to bed anyways."" I say ""okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow then, good night,"" and she replies ""well that was easy. yeah I'll talk to you tomorrow,"" and I just sat there really confused. It's like she was testing me? I don't even know. I told her I was just trying to respect her rest and didn't want to bother her when it was so late. I ended up going over to her place and spending the night.

And since then, it's just been the same. I'll send her a message every day asking her how she is, trying to make plans, etc. etc. and every now and then, she just doesn't respond and lets the conversation entirely die. And it's not just texting, it's Snapchat and Instagram DMs too. I'll send her a cute post that makes me think of her and she'll leave me on read. It feels like she's not putting effort into staying in touch.

I didn't hear from her this past weekend and decided to call her the night before her first day of work. When she picked up, everything seemed fine. Completely fine, we were laughing and joking just like we normally do. I had to hang up to leave for dinner and told her that I'd try to call her again when I got home, if she hadn't already gone to bed. I texted her when I got back and she just said ""not tonight, sorry."" I sent her what I thought was a sweet message wishing her luck and telling her that she's going to kill it and she just wrote back ""thank you.""

I don't know why but that just really stung. I decided to not say anything to her until she reached out to me, and it's been three whole days. I've had literally zero contact from her. I get that starting a new job is stressful and all, but is it too much to expect just a text asking me how I've been? Now, I don't know what to do - thoughts?

tl;dr - I'm always the one reaching to my girlfriend, she never initiates any contact with me. She just started a stressful new job so I figured I'd give her space but also see how long it takes for her to reach out to me first. It's been three days without any word, what should I do?

877,2tru4,[new],10,c5xiyj,1,"I originally met my girlfriend 2 years ago when looking to share an apartment with someone. She said she was lonely by herself and could afford it so I got a crazy good deal (I live in the San Francisco bay area so it?s stupid expensive). After I moved in, we very quickly became best friends and hung out together all the time. Because her parents are VERY wealthy she hasn?t really need to have a formal job so instead spends most of her days doing pottery, painting, and drawing (she was diffidently good enough to do these professionally even then). A year ago, I got invited by my best friend from high school to work for him.  The details aren?t important but basically my job hours are really weird and kind of random, I don?t have fixed time off and it?s very stressful at times. My job would suck if it weren?t for the fact that some days I don?t have to do anything I just have to be on call ready to work. Those days I usually spend with her and I?m incredibly happy. 6 months ago at the start of December, her father suddenly passed due to a heart attack. She?s a very sensitive, feeling person and he was very close to her so it hit her hard. Her world came to and end. I happened to be off work for the month because my boss was on vacation with his kid so I spent every day comforting her and taking her mind off of it.

When we first decided to move in together we were 18( it was decided so early cause of my bad household living situation, this isn?t relevant) 
We moved into a trailer with one of his long time best friends, than moved out ( that didn?t work out cause his friend began having feelings for me) to an apartment than our trailer ( our current living place)

Ever since we lived together we have had constant sex problems. We realized that he had formed a porn addiction. He is very aware of it and has even opened up about it ( while in tears). This problem has been going on for a long time, but after long conversations for quiet a long time, he is currently working on his problem, yet again.  As of today he said he has not master-bated with or without  porn.( it?s been about 4-5 days). Which I know can be very tempting for him. He generally wants to be a better person to me and for himself, and I do not doubt him about that. 
But something that is kinda of bothering me is how distant he still seems to be. 
He hasn?t once tried to have sex with me, he?s barely touched me, ( and I mean literally like cuddling touch, flirtation, etc) I have to him, plenty of times. ( it been a long while since we have had an intimate moment) ( and I?m only human, I crave and need that as a woman). I try to give him as much time as he needs, and I?m very patient with him, but I feel the more I wait and wait the long and drawn out this seems to get. ( this has happened before). 
He has always said that this has nothing to do with me and all  the problem is with him, but I feel like I cannot shake the feeling that maybe it is straight up me, ( since that has happened so many times) 
maybe he has lost his sexual attraction to me, ( I?m not fat, but I def don?t look like I used to in high school) (which is fine(very painful) but I just wish that I could know)( cause this is already painful as it is). 
Idk, maybe I sound crazy, but I mean he hasn?t cum In Nearly a week, and usually he always wants something by this point ( at least it has been like this in the past) but now he doesn?t even consider me in that way anymore. And I?m just kinda left in dark, waiting. 

Sorry, this is so long. Also I?m honestly not looking for easy solutions like breaking up, I could never imagine a day that I couldn?t see this mans face. I?m dearly In Love with him, and I continue to love him through thick and thin. I believe that?s what makes a relationship work, is actually solving problems and than moving on to the next( cause y?all know that problems don?t disappear forever lol). I am aware that he has a problem and I am willing to do anything for our relationship and anything for him and his problem. 
This is not just a love crush thing, this is serious relationship that I and him both have put in extremely hard work towards( with bettering our selves and learning to communicate effectively) 
I?m sorry, but I cannot consider vague ? dump him? comments, I went on this thread for a reason, and that?s for advice on my relationship and how to come at this in a mature and respectful way, and some advice on some ways to help with that process. 
I appreciate anyone who comments.

I do volunteer work, which is where I met acquaintance. I'll call him A to make it easier. A took a liking to me for some reason, even though we have nothing in common, and got my number off someone. The first few times he texted me it was related to volunteering so I let it slide, but semi quickly turned into casual chatting. I told him straight up that I wanted to stay professional and stopped answering non-volunteering-related messages.

A continues to push for friendship, asking to hang out, to walk me to the bus, etc etc. Although he has never asked me out I've had several people ask me if I know he seems to have a crush on me (but I can't be sure since he's never straight up said or asked anything). It's become a common thing for people at my volunteering place to joke about how cute his ""puppy love"" towards me is. Meanwhile I avoid A as much as I can and don't answer any of his messages/calls anymore.

A won't accept my ""I want to stay professional only"", I'd look like an ass if I rejected him and it were to turn out he didn't have a crush on me, and he's got some sort of a mental handicap so going ""I don't want to be friends"" would cause social pushback and lots of hurt feelings.

We send Pete a photo because we all genuinely thought that it would make him happy that his two groups of good friends were bonding and thinking of him. He didn't respond to the photo and when we got home, we realized that he had stopped sharing his location with us (we've all had our locations on basically since we met), and I texted him this morning and asked if he was okay/if we did something to upset him, and he didn't respond but is active on social media.

&#x200B;

I can imagine him feeling left out (although he's the one who bailed on our plans to spend roomie's birthday together), but his reaction doesn't seem proportionate to just wishing you weren't missing out on something. I was super inebriated all of last night and felt very positive and happy about everything, so it's totally possible that I just wasn't picking up on any tension or mishaps.

883,dickfodayz,[new],2,c5x8yg,1,"So I lost my virginity 4 months ago to this guy that I met when I was younger, but was never really friends with. I'm female and 19, while this guy is 23.


We sort of had an unofficial friends with benefits thing going on since he took my virginity. There was some mild texting and exchanging of nudes. I was still the one who asked him to come over a majority of the time and I never really texted him other than to ask if his busy.


He is fairly good looking at works out a lot while I am very mildly chubby. He gave the impression that he knew he could date models, though this was never something I cared about because this was exclusively sex.


He texted me about a month ago asking if i had any fantasies that I wanted to do. I told him i couldn't think of any so he listed some for me one of which being a threesome. 


A week ago I told him I might be down to try a threesome. Within an hour he was at my house with one of his friends. The threesome went fairly well other than me making a few, possible rude comments, towards my fwb when he tried to show off with his friend there. 


The first time I hit him up after the threesome he said he was down, but when the actual day came he said he was busy. His friend from the threesome hit me up and he came over instead. That whole encounter with his friend went really well although I kind of got the vibe that he and my fwb planned it so that my fwb couldn't come over. 


Since then I have tried to plan times for me and my fwb to meet up and he bailed the last time and has ignore the message I sent today. I have no problem with this ending, however I really liked his friend. I haven't had contact with his friend since we had sex the last time. I dont want to go behind my fwb's back and I also dont know if his friend just wanted a one time thing.


So my question is, what would be the mature way to handle things with my fwb since I'm getting the feeling that's its ending? Did I come across as too desperate? And also how would I go about finding out if his friend is interested in having sex with me again with out coming across as creepy or potentially making things weird with him and his friend? Would it be bad to ask my fwb about his friend and what his friend thinks about having sex with me again?? Thanks.

884,ughhhhhhhhagh,[new],2,c5x7hj,1,"I recently had a ""casual"" relationship where I was the one mostly initiating hangouts/texting first for several months (since February). While we were hanging out, I always felt like he liked me as a person, and we always spent 5-12 hours talking around the part where we had sex (despite me often labeling hangouts as ""booty calls"" when I invited him and trying to make it clear he could leave right after.) There were 3-4 times he invited me to see his bands play live and to meet his friends (i.e. hang out beyond sex) which I was generally busy for, and he did bring me to his friends' art show once, but those were always unprompted by me; I did not want a casual FWB meeting my friends.

&#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, hanging out for that long and talking so much every 1-2 weeks led to me developing feelings for him, even knowing he wasn't interested as much as ""down"" (seeing as I was always the one asking him over). Once I realized being the one initiating constantly and that wanting to spend time so badly with someone who wasn't all that into me was making me miserable, which didn't take long, I texted him asking for a break so I could cool off and be less involved (which was honestly a little ridiculous, because to not hang out with him I could have just stopped initiating for a few weeks). I decided to just tell him how I felt and get properly rejected last week, because I didn't see those feelings going away anytime soon.

&#x200B;

When we talked on the phone, he rejected me pretty solidly, answering my ""I am more than casually attracted to you"" with a ""I don't see you romantically"". He then did try to have a normal conversation with me, which was terse (I was upset, which I'm not sure he got) and it ended with him asking ""Do you still want to come see my band play"" at which point I had to say ""I'm embarrassed and this took a lot of energy"" and ending the conversation.

&#x200B;

My problem is that I still feel very drawn to this person and still really want to be involved in his life. I don't know how long it would take for romantic hopes/feelings to fade, but I've stayed friendly with people who rejected me before (who I wasn't having sex with). Right now I feel like I'll regret it for a long time if we don't end up staying friends, because I really do just like him as a person, and enjoy spending time with him. However, I know it'll make me continue wanting more and having a little unrealistic hope for longer than otherwise.

&#x200B;

My main question is, if I am going to be friends with this person, do I have to do any initiating or make it clear that's something I want? Would people in his position need to know that, or if he's secretly relieved to be done with me would that guilt him into feeling like he has to talk to me still? I know that initiating hangouts or event invitations will make me feel pathetic and needy for at least the next couple months, but our previous dynamic of me always initiating makes me unsure if he'd ever feel motivated to do that unless I verbalize that's how I feel. If you think that telling him that is something I should do, how do I do it without making him feel pressured/giving him an easy out if what he really wants is to avoid me for all time now?

&#x200B;

TL;DR After being rejected romantically in a FWB situation, do I need to communicate what I want/do any initiating if I want to stay friends, or is that unhealthy and I should just give him space to do so if he's going to?",1561588597.0,"23F wondering if it's wise to seek out friendship after rejection from FWB, and if so how",1.0

I was showing him a tour of the school, we talked for a while, he asked me for my number and things sorta happened. These last years have been wonderful, he is such a great guy. Not only is he attractive but he?s such a wonderful boyfriend. He treats me right, makes me feel special everyday even when we?re fighting. We just have such a great connection, we can talk about anything, we have a very open relationship and I can just be myself around him without needing to hide anything. 

I know he feels the same way too and I do believe this will last and become something more. Another reason why I?m so attracted to him, is his connection with my family. He hangs out with my parents and my younger brother. My parents love him and he?s like a cool older brother to my brother. My family has happily welcomed him into the family and everything is just great. 

However, I think my dad likes him too much. They hang out a lot, talk about fires because they?re both firefighters and they?ve been working on a car my dad has in the garage. I?m glad they have such a close bond and I feel as if everything is just right, even though their closeness feels a bit weird. However, his birthday is today, and my dad spent almost $8,000 and bought him an ATV. It was a huge surprise to everyone, my mom and my boyfriend are both surprised. My boyfriend has been saying how he wanted one for the longest of time and my dad went out and got him one for his birthday. My boyfriend was excited but felt uncomfortable because it was so expensive. 

My mom is mad that he didn?t discuss it with her before hand and it?s just weird all around. I?m glad he got a gift he enjoyed and all but spending $8K on my boyfriend is just weird. My parents are well off and can afford but it?s still uncomfortable. Maybe if we were married or at least lived together but at the moment it feels weird and my boyfriend is weirded out by it too even though he?s excited.

My girlfriend works 2-3 miles away and gets off work around midnight

&#x200B;

Story:  
I use to pick up my girlfriend 1-2 times a week on the weekdays but now with my given situation, I told her I won't be able to anymore as in my area it takes about 30 minutes - 1.5 hour to look for a parking spot if I leave after 5PM (Not exaggerating). 

  
She got really upset with me and said she can not rely on me and that I'm selfish and that I will never understand what she's feeling.

In my eyes, the trade off is clear as day:  


1) I can pick her up like usual, but spend 30 minutes - 1.5 hours after I pick her up to look for a parking spot 

2) She can call an Uber/Lyft like she normally does on the days that I don't pick her up and I even offered to pay for her Uber/Lyft on some days when she needs me to.

If you turn the tables around isn't it selfish for her to make me go through all of this just to pick her up when all it takes is 10-15 minute ride home from Uber/Lyft? It's not like she's walking home alone or taking the bus late at night or something. So I want to ask, is there something clear that I'm missing here?

Not really sure where to begin with all of this, so bare with me. Throwaway so none of my friends see this, btw. 


About 2 1/2 years ago, I moved from Louisville to Seattle to be with John. We had been together for about two years before that, mostly long distance due to him moving back home. We only really saw each other a handful of times per year so I decided to take the plunge and move across the country since I wanted to move anyway. It was amazing, truly. I love WA and don?t regret it at all. But that?s not the point, sorry. 


Anyway, it was great until his father?s health started getting bad. His dad is very sick and doctors said he has less than 5 years left. So (about 6mo ago) John immediately told me that he wanted to drop everything and take care of his dad while he was in this rough patch. We talked about it and together, decided it was the right thing to do. I was 110% behind him. We quit our jobs in Seattle and moved closer to his dad?s town. We both started working again and found an apartment near dad?s house and it was great. We had similar work hours and he had time to be with his dad, I found friends and stuff. It was really nice. We maintained a healthy relationship &amp; sex life just like usual. 


But lately things have taken a dip. 


It started with me getting promoted in May. I was given the management position at my work. It?s great pay, but the hours are different than what I had before. I usually work split shits in the morning/evening (about 5am/opening-10am &amp; 4pm-8pm/closing, weird, I know. I do this Monday-Thursday, work all day on Saturdays, so not a lot of freetime) and sometimes have to cover other shifts, which leads to chaos. It was alright though, both of us made it work and it was still good until John was forced to start taking different hours at his work too. He now works 4pm-1am. When he?s not working, he?s either sleeping or with his dad. On his off days (2 per week, usually Friday &amp; Saturday), he?s out with friends. Our sex life is now pretty much only exists over text because of our schedules and I feel like we never see each other. Today, we had maybe two or three hours together before he had to go to dad?s and I had to go back to work. I?m at a loss. This is the most time we?ve spent with one another in a while. 


I just don?t know what to do. I feel selfish even thinking about talking to him about this. Taking care of his dad is something that needs to be done and I?m not mad at him for doing it, but I just feel lonely. His work hours are solid for the foreseeable future and his dad is only getting worse. And I just don?t know how to talk with him about it. I love John so much. We?ve been together for just over 5 years & I don?t know what I would do without him, I really don?t. Breaking up with him is one of my worst nightmares, honestly. It sounds dramatic but I?ve spent a long time with him. So... I just don?t know. Hoping maybe you guys might have some advice on how to help fix this situation.

TLDR: I (22f) moved from Louisville to Seattle to be with my boyfriend 3 years ago, we had been together for two years before that. His sick dad?s condition started getting worse so we dropped everything and moved closer to his dad?s town. Everything was good. We found jobs and an apartment, sex life & relationship were good.

The problem is I don't know how to convey the fact that... She didn't do anything wrong. She is an incredible, caring, beautiful person. But I just know in my gut this isn't right for me. And it's killing me that I'm going to devastate her out of the blue.

I've been doing a lot of thinking. And I've come to a difficult point... I have feelings for you that I never expected to find for someone. But it's honestly made me question myself a lot. And I realize that even though I think you are an amazing person, I'm not in a stable enough place to be in a relationship.

I'm just not able to do this. I think I still have more baggage than I realized, and I am constantly worried about letting you down, I have a lot of anxieties that I can't directly put words to at the moment, and a variety of other things, which are completely my own issues and insecurities.

I want you to know that everything I've said to you is 100% true, which is why this is that much more difficult. You've done absolutely nothing wrong, and there is nothing that could have gone differently to change this.

But I do genuinely love you, and I respect you... Which is why I don't want to lead you on, and I want to tell you all this as soon as I'm realizing it... Even though I know it's going to hurt... And this is all incredibly hard to process.

We end up going out of our way to meet his friend at his house. Turns out not only he was joining us, but his wife was too. On top of that, we were set to meet with \*another\* friend of theirs before heading out to lunch. This second friend, I had never even heard of.

As the day goes on, it becomes clear that these people will not only be spending the entire weekend with us, but that this had been planned in advance. His friends talked about plans they had made in front of me, clearly not knowing that I had been in the dark about all of this. They had full on dinner parties planned. I am glad to meet and get to know my bf's friends, but dinner parties with married couples is not what I had in mind for our fun couple's trip. I made that so very clear, so many times. I told him that we would plan our couple's trip fr somewhere else and he could come to Portland on his own for friend time.?

That day, I spent virtually no time with my bf. I was just spending time with the first friend's wife, while the men grouped off and did their own thing. When we were driving back to the hotel, I told my bf that I was really disappointed in how things had turned out. He insisted that the friends were nice, so it was okay. I replied that it didn't matter that they were nice. We had explicitly discussed this issue and he had clearly been dishonest with me. He had made his own plans behind my back. He replied that when we did things together, it was always what I want and that he was allowed to do things that he liked too. I again stated that the issue was the dishonesty.

The next morning, he cancelled his plans with his friends for the day. However, he spent the next day being lukewarm at best towards me. In an effort to lighten the mood, I jokingly said that he was acting like a hostage. He, not jokingly, replied that he did feel like a hostage. The day ended early, as I was extremely upset at this attitude.

The next day was, again, tense. He, at one point, told me that I was being disrespectful towards him, because I was admittedly being relatively distanced at that point. I was so exhausted by then that I just told him to leave me alone. That night, we went to the aforementioned dinner party (after spending about an hour looking for and buying a gift and flowers for the host). At the dinner party, he was his usual social self. But things with us were heavy and tense.

This is not the first time he was really ruined a big, exciting event for me. About a year ago, I had my white coat ceremony. I was really excited and was headed to the event with my bf. Just ad we arrived, I realized that I had forgotten some paperwork. It wasn't a big deal in my view. We lived close by and we had plenty of time to go back and get everything. He, however, was furious. He slammed out of the building ahead of me and full on sped back to out place. i kept pleading with him to calm down, that it was going to be okay. He continued acting furious with me, though. By the time we got back to my place, I was pissed too. I slammed the car door when I got out of the car. By the time we got back to the venue, I was blinking back tears. Someone asked me what was wrong and I said that he had ruined my day. He then slammed out of the venue and left the event. I went through the ceremony without him. He came back in time for pictures. This was a huge life event and a huge accomplishment for me. I worked extremely hard to get to that day and had been dreaming about it for years. Now, the memory of that day is completely tarnished.

Neither of the above events have been discussed since. He totally shuts down and will not hear it when he is being challenged, He very very rarely apologizes or admits fault. It just is swept under the rug until it blows over.?

Obviously, I am only sharing the very worst parts of our relationship. He is also a very gentle, loyal, and caring person. He has sacrificed a great deal for me and for others he cares about. Frankly, he has sacrificed more than me. He covered all of my expenses and never let me worry about money when I was in a job I was dissatisfied in so I could quit and focus on pursuing school. He left a job he loved and was succeeding in to be with me when I moved after college. He has taken care of my grandma when she got sick, which is unglamorous, thankless, and (frankly) sometimes gross work. There is a lot about what we share that is great. Obviously, if all we had is what I detailled below, I would be gone. I just want some advice on the best way to proceed. Do I cut my losses? Can I handle things in a more effective way? Am I in the wrong?

898,zebraweesa,[new],8,c5w9ep,2,"30 M here. Been with the gf (27) for a little over a year now. Everything is great, but I can?t help always feeling anxious about the possibility of her feelings changing and her deciding to leave. I felt this way in my previous relationships too so I know it?s a problem with me and not her. We have great mutual respect for one another and have created a great partnership. She goes and does her own thing and so do I. We maintain healthy boundaries and can both be individuals outside of our relationship. BUT while I love this about us, I can?t help but still feel insecure. I think I?m used to my partners showing love by projecting their insecurities onto me. This doesn?t happen in my current relationship, which is something I love, but something I?m still getting used to. 

It?s the trivial things that make me anxious and I know how dumb this sounds. To give you friends an example of what?s going on in my head: yesterday she got home from a concert, and went straight to bed. She was tired and We didn?t really get to chat before bed like we usually do. In situations like this, my brain just goes haywire and I begin to wonder what?s wrong and whether she?s losing feelings for me or doesn?t love me anymore. It?s so absurd. I?m invested and believe she may be the real deal, but this is fucking with my head. I feel myself distancing away from her even though I love her. 

You guys may suggest therapy, that?s a great idea. Have tried it and hasn?t been helping. I?m not giving up though. In the meantime, anyone have any suggestions or advice? How do I stop feeling this way? It?s preventing me from being present and enjoying the relationship. It?s very hard to put these thoughts down on paper so please excuse the jumbled mess of a post.

899,Qatsius,[new],6,c5w1dc,5,"Hello,
I wouldn't normally share this with the internet but as the title says, im desperate.
So I've known this girl like 3 years (NOW SHE'S 18), met in high school, still are in high school. I got to know her because she was just gorgeus and already from the start I had feelings for her. So we ended up being friends, I'd say pretty close friends, hanging out by the river and telling each other stories. At this time I really wanted to tell her, what my feelings are but there simply wasn't the moment for that.


So recently, she had this birthday party and I was invited. I brought her really nice flowers and her favorite sweet, but that doesn't matter that much. There were like 15 people at this party, and it 5 people, including me and her, stayed for the night, all of us had fun, we watched a movie, when all of them fell asleep (it was like 3 a.m) except me and her of course. Through out watching the movie, i had been rubing her hands and head, gently like a friend, until we noticed that everyone slept.
So she brought me upstairs. (I have to mention, that I am a virgin and never really did something with a woman) We were lying right next to each other, talking about more personal stuff, which we had never spoken about. When suddenly she kissed me out of nowhere. And I, unexperienced boy, was just lying there because didnt know what to do. Eventually I started kissing her and that lasted for like an hour. It was a really intimate hour and I really enjoyed it because I was making out with my crush and was thinking, that it would turn in something more than just a friendship. Because making out with your friend without further intentions is creepy, at least for me.
So I woke up, totally happy, didn't know how to act in front of the other people. Eventually I left in the morning and we just hugged as a farewell.


So the next day I talked to her about what it meant to us and she told me, that she really likes me, and that she just saw in my eyes, that I want something, so she gave it to me, therefore it meant nothing for her in the long run. At that night it meant a lot she said. She was also like 3 months after a breakup, and told me, that   right now I'd end up as her ex.


I was totally devastated at that point and stormed out home. And  now here I am, writing this post, have nothing to do and I'm thinking of her 24/7 because that night made my crush even a bigger crush. Now she isn't responding to my messages and I'm so desperate. Should I give it time? Please tell me what to do.

I didn't accept her invitation but I didn't say no either (I wasn't ready then).I was really insecure because I made myself out to be a sex goddess when at the time, I was still a virgin.

After having sex with someone else, I see that it wasn't really a big deal that I was inexperienced. Sex is pretty natural especially if you're sleeping with someone who has a lot of experience.

The girl on Bumble and I had a few rifts- she started to grow colder towards me. Then, one day she just stopped messaging me. I was too proud to message her since I thought she was in the wrong and I was also really insecure because I was Virgin Mary at the time lol.

I find myself thinking a lot about her these days. Especially since I've exhausted Tinder and Bumble and OKCupid and I've failed to find someone as attractive and as eager as she was.

903,LostNLonesome,[new],16,c5vi33,1,"Me (33F) and my BF (47M) have been trying to remodel a bathroom due to some bad plumbing. This has led to some nasty arguing. My BF has a habit of breaking up with me during arguments, which happened the weekend before last. But we made up. 

Last weekend he was complaining that he couldn't sleep from the stress and had a constant stomachache. He gets kind of unhinged about things going wrong around the house. I told him he needs to relax and get his head straight because he had started acting very erratic and hostile. So I spend 4 days, Friday thru Monday, doing all the chores around the house, cooking cleaning, taking care of pets, making special meals for him, doing our laundry, totally catering to him. He sat on the couch and played video games and watched tv and relaxed, or tried to relax with mixed results.

Tuesday morning he calls me on his way in to work and asks what kind of light fixture I want, since we're replacing the old one. I say something old fashioned and rustic, we live in a farmhouse from the 20's. He starts making an argument about how track lighting is better. I say okay, we'll do track lighting. He tells me I make him miserable and I'm too stubborn to compromise and he can never be happy because he can't finish the project now because I was supposed to choose the light fixture and since I refuse he can never work on it again. I was shocked at how he quickly he turned on me over something so trivial, especially when I told him I was happy to get the lighting he wanted. It was as if he was looking for a reason to lay into me. 

I spent 4 days doing everything I could to make him happy and calm and relaxed. It was soul crushing to have the only person I've ever loved tell me I make him miserable when I am putting forth my absolute best effort. I'm not sure it's worth continuing this relationship.

904,musicalspheres,[new],7,c5vgxv,1," This is a question about a platonic relationship between two males.

&#x200B;

I've known Jake for three years now. We often have fun together, particularly in group contexts, but he often does things that upset me. In particular, he makes me feel ignored and dismissed, which then causes me to feel hurt and angry. Here are some examples of what I mean.

&#x200B;

\+ Last year, I bought him and another friend, Andy, copies of a video game for their birthdays for us to all play together. Jake didn't thank me and seemed ambivalent about playing the first few sessions we got together, then started making excuses every time I suggested getting together to play. He never directly said he wasn't interested in playing the game, but he has never been the one to suggest getting together to play and has blown me and Andy off the last six times we've tried to get together to play the game (since January).

&#x200B;

\+ He often doesn't respond to text messages I send him. For example, a few months ago, I texted him about an opportunity to perform together in a production put on by a mutual friend and he didn't respond. I called him the next day to follow up, he canceled my call, and he just texted back ""Sorry, I can't talk right now. In a movie."" then never followed up.

&#x200B;

\+ I notice that any time I try to connect with him on an emotional level, he doesn't reciprocate. He got me a birthday gift once, which I really liked, and I thanked him. His eyes widened, and he said ""oh, no...I didn't really put any thought into that."" On a couple other occasions in the past, I've tried to tell him that I appreciated his friendship (via cards, text messages, etc.) and he has just ignored me.

&#x200B;

\+ We used to sing together in an acapella quartet before I left the group for personal reasons. A few weeks ago, Andy invited me to come back and sign with the group again. It was unclear to me whether the guys wanted me back long term or for just one night. At the end of our rehearsal, I asked the group whether they wanted me to come back the following week and was just met with stone silence. I was sitting across the table from Jake, and we had been talking and having a great time, but he just didn't even acknowledge that I'd said anything.

&#x200B;

\+ Last night, I was at board game night with the gang. Jake had reminded me about board game night a couple times in the days leading up to the event and, as usual, when we were hanging out, we seemed to get along great. We laughed and all enjoyed each other's company. At the end of the evening, I asked the group (there were five other people and me) whether anyone wanted to go see a movie the following week. Jake (and a couple of the others) didn't respond to me at all. Not a ""no, I'm busy;"" not a ""when is the movie?;"" just nothing - it was as if I hadn't said anything at all. Afterward, I sent him a text message asking ""How come you didn't say anything when I ask if anyone wanted to see Whisper of the Heart? That struck me as strange."" He hasn't responded, and based on the examples I've mentioned above and others I haven't, I don't think he will.

&#x200B;

All of these things taken together make it seem like Jake just doesn't like or respect me very much and he and I just shouldn't be friends. That is the way it often feels. I often find myself angrily ruminating about these sorts of behaviors for hours and it just feels unhealthy. I'm starting to feel like I should just cut off contact with Jake, as he ends up pissing me off.

&#x200B;

Yet, at the same time, there is a lot that I enjoy about our relationship. We share many common friends and see each other a lot. He invites me to all the group activities that he hosts. When we do see each other, like I mentioned above, we have a great time, laugh a lot and get along great. I generally like and respect him as a person and would like to keep being friends with him, but I'm not sure whether it's worth it.

&#x200B;

It's really difficult for me to figure out why Jake treats me this way. It seems really disrespectful - the way you'd treat someone you don't want in your life - but this behavior is not consistent. My read on the situation is that he's got some sort of anger or resentment against me, but is afraid to confront me about it and is just deeply passive aggressive.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing or have any advice?

905,vipercat5,Infidelity,172,c5vfw7,58,"Hello,

I cant even believe I am writing this. I (34F) found out last week that my partner (34M) visited a sex worker the week prior when drunk and paid for a prostitute for both himself and his friend.

&#x200B;

He acted totally normal in the days following and only when I checked our joint bank statement did I find the transactions because the dumbass was so drunk that he was STUPID ENOUGH TO USE OUR JOINT ACCOUNT. He said the transactions were to buy tickets to a gig, and only when the penny dropped later that night did I look further into it and discover they were payments to brothels. The moment of discovery was most painful of my life and I cant get the image of seeing those words out of my mind. Massage parlour. Brothel. Escort/ dating service. And then clicking through to find out more about the business and seeing a link to a news article about a brothel the police have been trying to close. I am fucking traumatised to say the least.

&#x200B;

Once he saw I had the cold, hard evidence, he confessed, said he was blind drunk, has never done anything like this before, and just wanted to ?get off? as we?ve been struggling in our relationship and haven?t had sex in months. This made me feel even worse - like if id just given him more sex, he wouldn?t have done something like this.

&#x200B;

But the fact he lied about it and hid it from me makes it feel so much worse. I kicked him out and have spent the last week oscillating between rage, grief, denial, worthlessness, and fear. I am struggling to eat or sleep, or function at work.

&#x200B;

Prior to this relationship I was with my ex for 12 years (and married to him) and the pain of that divorce doesn?t even come close to what I am feeling right now. It's a level of pain I didnt even know was possible. I feel so violently betrayed and devalued as a human. He swears he has never done it before and gave me full access to his bank statements which I have pored through, and was unable to find anything. But does it even make a difference? HE STILL DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HE WASN'T GOING TO TELL ME.

&#x200B;

To add to this, he cheated on his last girlfriend with ME (and yes I?m aware I had a part to play in that but he told me they were in the process of ending things long before they were) which proves this is not the first time he has been dishonest. The trust feels totally broken and I am struggling to function as a person.

&#x200B;

We were having serious issues in our relationship prior to this happening and the lack of sex was part of a bigger issue - mainly that he suffers from depression, completely withdraws emotionally and has basically been going through a breakdown for the last 2 years and unemployed for the last 6 months. I have struggled to be physically intimate with someone so disconnected and unfulfilled, who never seems present. The irony is that I have been the one trying to work on our relationship - constantly trying to open up conversations (he has a completely avoidant attachment style and AVOIDS talking about ANYTHING), even suggesting to schedule sex the week prior as a way to kickstart our dead bedroom. I?ve also been going to therapy weekly for the last couple of months to find out how to better express my needs and be able to support him better.

&#x200B;

I?ve been going out of my mind trying to figure out how to make HIM happy and fix OUR relationship and he goes and cheats on me with a CHEAP HOOKER and BUYS ONE FOR HIS FRIEND (who is single but has 2 young daughters) and then LIES TO ME ABOUT IT. He admits he wouldn?t have told me if I hadn?t found out because he was ""so ashamed"".

&#x200B;

I do (probably stupidly) believe him that it was a one off thing, but I?m not sure that even makes a difference. He claims they only had sex for 5 minutes and that he didn?t come, and left in disgust. Again, I?m not sure if this makes a difference. He came home and DID NOT SHOWER and got into bed next to me. He claims he was so drunk he couldn?t register what he had done.

&#x200B;

I kicked him out as soon as I found out, and since then he has taken radical responsibility, makes no excuses, saying he?s made the worst mistake of his life, it was not pre-planned, but a horrific choice made on impulse etc etc. I believe he is sorry and I also believe that underneath it all he is a good person. He had an abusive childhood and has a lot of issues as a result, and unfortunately made a huge mistake and did a terrible thing in betraying me - the person who has always loved him most. I do believe this - but it doesn't change what he did. It doesn't change the way it makes me feel.

&#x200B;

He is beside himself with grief and the sad thing is that I genuinely believe this could be the catalyst for him to finally get his shit together and become the partner I have always wanted him to be - who pays attention to my needs, stops wallowing in self pity and learns to value what he has. But this absolute disgusting and COWARDLY act (the lying) has shaken me to my core and I am physically sick over it (like actually physically, I have thrown up repeatedly).

&#x200B;

I know we weren?t happy in our relationship - but that aside, we?ve always had a very strong mental connection that I?m scared I won?t find with anyone else. And so much shared history. I am desperately longing for him and missing him (whilst being equally repulsed and disgusted) but can?t work out how much of that is codependency. I guess only time will tell.

&#x200B;

I?m also anxious as I?m 34 and want to have a family and am scared I have left it too late to start all over again, especially after having to recover from a trauma like this, which may take years. My whole life jsut feels completely fucked.

&#x200B;

What am I supposed to do? I am losing my mind and keep visiting the website of the brothel and going over and over the moment of discovery in my mind, whilst beating myself up for not being ?good enough? as a girlfriend. This is a living hell. Any advice would be much appreciated. The thing I?m struggling with most is the fact I still love him, despite what he done this to me. I miss him. It's gut-wrenching.

I finally have a job that will let me work remote; this option really made me question my engagement. I will spare the details but we had an overall content relationship (so I thought). My new job made me realize that missing out on family time has really affected me. I miss home, miss my family, miss my friends, etc. I broke up our 6 year relationship, 4 months ago, and have never been happier. I made the decision to move back home and life felt complete.

I had about 5 months left until my lease ends and decided to fill my time with dating and making new friends. For the first time in my life I am so happy living here. I take care of myself, I go out, I finally have a girl group, and just doing things on my own. Ultimate independence has never felt better. I went on a series of dates and had zero expectations of meeting someone (why not? I?m moving anyways). Well... i met Guy. Dating Guy has been so refreshing and made me realize how shitty my last relationship was. I told Guy I was moving.. right after he told me he wanted to be exclusive. We both agreed that long distance relationship is something we both do not want, given we've only known each other for a few weeks. We both agreed to continue being exclusive until I move and to enjoy the time we have left.

Fast forward 2 months; I am moving in 3 weeks. He tried to convince me to stay, several times, and came up with a few viable plans. My emotions are telling me to stay and see what happens but a large part of me wants to stick with my plan. My plan is to move in with my parents, make up ?lost? family quality time, buy a house, and generate extra income. I strongly feel that I need to set myself up for success, first, before going all in with Guy. That way, a failed relationship wont leave me stuck in another state (that I don?t care for), again. I want to avoid having to live out the rest of my lease (like now) and move home (like now). It wouldn?t feel right to use my family as a backup plan.

913,heartbroken1911,Relationships,14,c5uxsm,3,"TL;DR - My boyfriend \[25\] of 8 years is being dramatic coz I lied about a one night stand I had while we were broken up for more than a year. Now he's questioning my character and making me feel really crappy about the situation and myself. Am I wrong? Or is he overreacting?

&#x200B;

My boyfriend \[25M\] and I \[25F\] have been together since 2012. We started dating in high school and despite going to college in opposite ends of the globe we did long distance. In May 2016, he decided my crazy was too much, and ended it. I was devastated. He was literally the only person I ever loved and he just didn?t want anything to do with me at that time. 

Needless to say I did not take the breakup well at all. It took me over a year to stop missing him or hoping he would come back. 

Around September 2017 I was finally happy being single. Soon after, I went on a trip. I met a few friends at my destination and there was a lot of partying and drinking. One night I drank more than my fair share and I met a guy. Lot of poor decisions were made. The next morning I woke up with an extremely foggy memory of the night before. This was literally the 1st time in my life I had done something like that. I fled the scene and went back to my friends to resumed life as normal trying to put the night behind me. 

The guy however did text me to check if I was okay, and subsequently we got talking and I began to be infatuated. I admit that is weird, but I had only ever been with my boyfriend before that. 

Fast forward 3 months, little to no conversation with the guy, and I haven?t even thought about my ex. 

On the 31st of December, I wake up with a missed call from my ex. I was definitely intrigued and texted him asking why he called. We made small talk and that was that. 

At midnight my ex calls me to wish me happy new year. On January 1st, 2018 we begin talking as it was familiar and didn?t feel awkward. Filling each other in on the last year of our lives. In those talks, I mentioned to him that I had gone on my trip and then started telling him about my friend and where his friends were working (I was just out of college looking for a job). I did mention that guys name, but it had nothing to do with the ?night?. My boyfriend has known me for the better part of 5 years, and his 1st question was only about that guy. I kept the gory details as he had no reason to know. We were not together and he was far from my life. The topic didn?t not disappear and when it came up again, I said we just kissed. 

That seemed like a lot for him to digest. And he kept asking me why? It was a random person who I didn?t know, a friend of a friend etc. 

I didn?t feel the need to justify myself and neither did I want to keep reliving it. I wanted to move on. 

After a few weeks of talking, my boyfriend and I rekindled and he planned a trip to come visit me 1/2 way across the world. 

We had a wonderful time and the last year of our relationship had probably been the best in the last 8 years! So much so that 2 weeks ago, I moved to the same country as my boyfriend as an intern to make this work. 

My 1st weekend we went out one night and were drinking and laughing. We stopped to get McNuggets sometime during the night and he was telling me about some really hot chicks. As a joke I told him to try it with them. After I stressed that sex and love don?t correlate. 

At that point he brought up the guy again and said ?you keep saying this, it makes me think?..... 

I looked at him and said, I don?t remember. The night pretty much ended then. The next morning, I tried to talk to him.. after much convincing he said you should have just told me and not lied for a year. I apologised and said I didn?t want to lose you again. 

After the weekend he went back to his city and we have been doing our usual long distance since. 

We had been talking normally, and everything was smooth. This weekend he came to visit me again since we had 4 days off. It was truly amazing. He was making plans with me for August with his family and we were looking for plane tickets for a music festival that we're going to. 

Since he was leaving, we had sex and he didn?t even wear a condom. Then, One hour before his bus departure he decided to throw the bomb on me and brought up the guy again. Told me he?d been thinking about this since his drive back the last time and was not going to bring it up but he started questioning ?everything?. He basically inferred I was a whore and questioned why I had been so casual about having sex with the guy since we started talking. He claimed I strategically lied about the whole situation.

I dropped him to the metro station and all through he was extremely cold. I asked him if we would survive this and he said ?come to my city?. I left in tears and went back home. I called him to talk things over the phone and he said I don't want to do this over the phone! 

We ended the call and he texted me saying he loves me but he cannot do this. 

Agreed I lied  about it but he had no right to know anyway. He was out of my life, by his choosing. He had 4 days and 3 nights to bring it up and resolve it but he literally picked the last hour and then told me to come visit him! I feel like he handled the situation terribly and a part of me wonders if he just wanted to meet me one last time before calling it quits?

It has been 3 days since he?s called or texted me. At this point I?m heartbroken about the fact that he?s giving so much importance to one bad decision I made and questioning my character. He doesn?t see that I moved to a country where I don't speak the language to be with him. He doesn't see that he is the only person I love and have ever loved.

914,SvartFlamme,Relationships,7,c5ulc5,1,"So, I know I've posted a lot lately.  But this place has become a good outlet for me.

Like the title says, my Mom and my sister hate my girlfriend.  

I live in the US but I am originally from Europe.  My whole family still lives in my home country.  My girlfriend and I have been together for over 5 years.  Recently there was a short breakup between us.   I was the one who broke it off.  I have some mental issues, and I was in a really bad place at the time.  So I ended things with her.  A month went by and we got back together. 

But anyway... over the last five years my girlfriend and I have gone over to my home country twice.  The first time my family was excited to meet her.  They were glad I found someone, etc. All seemed to be well.  

The second time they weren't as warm.  In fact, there was a night when we were all over at my parents' house and my Mom and my sister were sitting right across the table from my girlfriend, talking bad about her in our native language.  I was livid.  

They told me how I could do so much better.  She's weird.  She's not pretty enough.  She's not successful enough... etc.  

We were supposed to go over there a third time.  We were planning on staying with my sister.  Well, my sister told me around the time we were going to buy plane tickets, that we might want to rethink this trip because we weren't allowed to stay with her.  

So I asked my Mom if we could stay with her.  My Mom told me she had no problem with me staying with her, but that my girlfriend would have to find somewhere else to stay.  I asked why and her answer was, ""Because I don't like her and I don't want her in my house.""  

Neither of them can give me a concrete reason why they don't like her.  

So, they both stopped talking to me for a while.  

Now, we are very low contact.  My sister and I were really close, too.  We are not even a year apart in age and we were best friends growing up.  Now I talk to her every few months, and my Mom even less than that.  (Mom and I have never been close, though.)

But, last I talked to my sister, girlfriend and I were still split up.  I've been wanting to tell her we are back together.  But I'm afraid of the drama it will cause.  I can just hear it now, ""Oh, you finally made a good decision for once.  And then you had to fuck it all up and get back with that bitch.""  

I have mental problems.  I have suffered from psychosis in the past.  I also deal with depression and OCD.  (OCD is the one that causes me the most distress, honestly.)  I don't know if they think my girlfriend is to blame for these issues.  They couldn't possibly think she made me like this.  THat's ridiculous.  

My parents had high expectations for me when I was a kid.  They were constantly pushing for more and more from me.  Do they expect me to be with a millionairess who is also a lingerie model and has an IQ of 250?  Someone like that would bore me.  

My girlfriend was my rock when I was going through some really hard times.  It's like they don't even care about that.  

So, does anyone have any advice on this situation, and also how I should tell my sister?  She wants to talk on Skype later on.  She will figure it out even if I don't tell her because she will see in the background that I am living in my old house again.

915,LessLovedThanEx,[new],5,c5uikd,12,"We have been dating for 1.5 years now and have known each other for two.

I have some looming insecurities about some of his past relationships. When we first met, we didn't date --- he later told me this was because he wasn't over his ex and ready to date, and I found it to be fine.

It just seems like the more we talk, the more it seems like he deeply regrets how things ended with her and wants her back. He claims she cheated on him multiple times, treated him extremely poorly then dumped him, but he still called her, essentially stalked her and was desperate to get back together with her. He's also extremely attached to his undergrad school, all his friends there and that was his college/first year out of college girlfriend. He dedicated an entire thesis to her in undergrad, over his own mother.

We're in graduate school, and I just keep feeling reservations about the whole thing. I like him, but at times the way he talks about it makes it seem as though if she were to call him today he'd jump into her arms.

The other day, I found a book from his undergrad years that he had written to a friend, in it, it extensively detailed why she was so beautiful, and intelligent, and wonderful, and how he fully planned to marry her in the future. I went through his email (which was terrible, I know) and found out that he had in fact proposed to her and had lied to me when I had previously asked him if he'd ever been married or engaged to anyone before. All previous emails refer to her as his fiance, --- so I still don't even know if he's lying about that. I also found pages of angry comedy sets he'd written about her.

He's only had 2 serious relationships, each lasting 2 years and he cheated on his first girlfriend to be with the second one. He isn't currently in contact with either, not friends on any social media or anything like that. I've brought up these concerns with him and he was appalled that I even felt that way, and claimed that his reactions in the past were out of immaturity and not real love and that the relationship was pretty immature in general (and that I looked better than them both, which I immediately replied means absolutely nothing).

Still, I can't help but feel slighted at worst, and not as loved at best. I feel like he isn't nearly as proud of me as he was of this ex of his. I had to fight with him to even post a picture of me anywhere on social media, and he proudly had his exes plastered on his facebook.

I genuinely have no idea how to fix this. I've cried so many times over my own irrational feelings. I've dated, but I've only had 1 serious relationship that ended when I was 19 and dated casually after that. Me, the ex, and him all live in the same city. He still says sayings and inside jokes they shared together. I feel as though I'm being paranoid, but it honestly feels like he has a lot of unresolved closure when it comes to this girl despite it ending three years ago.

I don't know what to do. I like him, but also: this. Advice?

So we have been together for the last 2 years, with a short break up period that lasted 3 months. She is anorexic since about 2011 and has been in hospital twice. At our first date I haven't really noticed, but she told me nevertheless so I knew since the start of the relationship what I was going to expect. She is very kind, sweet and loving and wouldn't it be for her sickness I would be pretty sure that i'd marry her. Unfortunately she is sick. We both study and she travels back home everyday and because of her mood swings we see each other only once a week. She is fine with it but I would love to see her more, most of the time.   
Her anorexia got worse and after a 5 month hospital visit it got better, but right now it is pretty bad and when I say pretty bad I mean it. She has less weight than some children ffs. I told her I only want to stay with her if she keeps up her diet and that she gets the weight up. She agreed to this but I am not totally sure if it works really. Her parents are caring for her and they are so loving and I know they are not to blame about her condition.   
Before I forget it, she is in therapy although she doesn't want to tell me what kind of therapies exactly. Another big problem is the sex. There is none. We both were virgins before we met and we had sex once, right at the start of the relationship when her weight was still kind of ok, but since then we didn't really have sexual interactions.  


I know I only can stay with her if she gets healthy but even then we won't be having kids (I don't know yet if I want children) but otherwise I don't see a future in this relationship. I really don't know how she would handle a break up because she is sometimes depressed and I know that this would be terrible for her. Also I wouldn't want to lose her and I would love to be with her, as a friend, but I personally would love to stay her partner, but I don't know if that is possible.

For the sake of anonymity, I'll call my crush ""N.""

So this all started 7 to 8 years ago, give or take. My grandparents, whom I am very close to, moved a city away to a safer neighborhood when I was around 9. Growing up, I always visited them for weekends at a time, maybe even longer than that, and occasionally my cousin, who is a year younger than me and my best friend, would often be there, too.

When they moved, they changed churches, and any time my cousin or I stayed with them on a Sunday, we were required to go to church with them. It didn't really bother us.

In the children's group, one person always stood out to me. This average looking boy always carrying around his Nintendo DS and talking with his friend. Not sure why, but he always seemed so cool to me. My cousin and I would whisper about him and talk about how ""cute"" he was. But we never spoke to him.

Years of this go by. The occasional visit on a Sunday to my grandparents, and always seeing that boy.

I was around 14 at the time when my cousin and I went on a short youth trip with the church. Not sure where. It was on the bus ride there that somehow, my cousin and I got to talking to the boy for the first time. He said his name was ""N"" and I learned that we had a lot in common. Video games, cartoons, anime, all sorts of nerdy stuff. And that's when I REALLY started crushing.

At that point, we were in youth group and I would make a point to hang out with him any time we were there. Through a mutual friend at the church, I got a text one evening of her asking for permission to give ""N"" my number. I obviously obliged and we stayed up late that night talking non-stop about anime, games, and puns. Rarely ever a serious conversation, but I didn't care. Every time I saw a notification from him, my heart skipped a beat.

So later that year, my family ends up moving to the same town as my grandparents, and a few months into that, the decision is made that I'd be attending public school for the first time since first grade. I was homeschooled. And to my disbelief, I was in the same grade as ""N."" 9th grade, and we were around 15-16.

First day of school, I'm looking for a seat at the first day presentation thing, extremely shy and nervous. ""N"" spots me and waves me down to the front row where he quickly introduces me to all of his friends, some of them I recognize from church. Then lunch comes around, and with the A day-B day schedule, I have a different group of people for lunch every other day. One day I'm sitting with his mutual friends, and the other day.... I'm sitting with him and a few other people. Needless to say, school rocked for me and I sprung out of bed every morning excited and happy.

Homecoming comes around later that year and I get invited by our mutual friends to join their group of mixed couples and singles. I'm one of the single girls in the group, and unfortunately, ""N"" is a part of one of the couples and starts dating a girl from band. But he still manages to look over at me during homecoming and comment on how happy I looked. I was, really, really happy.

After homecoming, during lunch, he made the comment to the rest of our friends at the table about how many guys asked me to dance. I was never sure why. He seemed excited and impressed about it. And another incident at lunch a few weeks later where his best friend thought he said he ""wanted to stick his wiener in me"" and I pretended not to hear. He looked so embarrassed and later texted me explaining that was not the case, where I again, played off like I didn't know what he was talking about to save his embarrassment.

I ended up leaving the school later that year, but out of my many friends that I had made, he was the only one that kept in contact with me. I would still attend football game solely to sit by the band and glance at ""N."" We would text about the songs the band played and he would tell me he was happy to have me there. One point during the next year, when I had switched schools but was still attending football games, ""N"" texted me wanting to see me in person after the game, as well as quoting lyrics to each other from the song they were playing, ""Hey baby (Won't You Be My Girl).""

He mentioned at some point after I left the School about missing having me there and how he was happy to know me, which is a rare ""serious"" conversation we had that didn't involve video games or cartoons.

I got snapchat and we snap all day, every day, mostly just pictures of our faces but the occasional random conversation. He's single now and has been for some time and after all these years, my feelings for him still persist.

I think about him all the time, dirty thoughts and dreams of simple dates. I still get butterflies talking to him and I will stop any activity to respond to him. Its always been this way. I don't wanna loose our friendship that I cherish so much but I can't shake wanting to be with him, no matter how hard I try. I even thought of him during my year-long relationship that I ended up breaking off. I want to loose weight and get confidence before I date him but I know if he ever asked me before that, I couldn't say no. But I do know I'd feel a little insecure dating him. Its like I feel he's too good for me and I wanna make myself better for him. Advice?

My GF has told me before that he texts her and calls her when his wife is out of town or not around.  He makes it sound like oh, woe is me.  I?m bored, do you want to talk?  She does not entertain his texts or usually answer his calls when he does call.

Now that I?ve been dating her for a number of months, how would I handle this?  It?s not just the text, and I?m sure there have been more like that.

I also found out that the two - husband and wife - are having some problems.  My GF?s friend, has nearly had an affair with a former boss she got reacquainted with recently.  She also walked out one night on her husband, and the husband called my GF.

I would like to just verbally say to please stop sending her sexy texts, and calls about being bored and wanting her attention.  Should I leave this up to my GF to deal with?  She wouldn?t say anything to him (and hasn?t to this point).  I would like to speak up and just be clear that I don?t like it.

I'm in a long distance relationship (7-8 months), and when were with each other its amazing! 

but when were apart shes SO boring, very self centered, never asks about my day or gives any interest in me, so after a while our conversations (usually about her) fizzle entirely.

Any pictures she sends me on snapchat also go on her story, so its completely impersonal, just a selfie or a picture of a meal.. ill reply with something nice, and she'll either not reply, or LITERALLY send another impersonal one that also goes on her story. 

100% understands she's busy, and doing her thing but.. i don't think she could give me less attention if she tried.

I've brought it up to her in the past, and her reply is ""I don't want to have to think about what to say to you all the time""... surly she should naturally want to be interested in me?

this results in me falling out of love with her, as i have nothing to love.. then i see her again and fall back in love. this just repeats.

Whats irritating is she's perfect in person. but not worth being ignored.
we go weeks without seeing each other and I can't stand this. If she doesn't show me any affection i struggle to show affection to her because i feel like im being rejected, then she says were as bad as each other as she misses when i say ""cute"" things when she never did anyway, then goes back to ""don't want to have to think about it"" argument.

924,delightfullydemented,[new],12,c5tyqs,3,"I met S about 5 years ago through a mutual friend. We get along well for the most part and hang out every so often. Before I get into the issue at hand, I'll give a bit more info about each of us as its relevant to the problem I'm having.

S is fit, active and super healthy. She has a really restrictive diet so going out to eat with her is almost impossible, she also doesn't drink. She works out daily and has a huge number of althetic interests and hobbies. Things like horseback riding, archery, running, rock climbing, etc. She also plays about a half dozen musical instruments and is a trained chef. Needless to say she's incredibly smart, amazingly talented and LOVES to keep busy. Basically, she likes to plan her weekends so that she is on the go from sunrise to midnight. Also, she is single and rents an apartment about 30 minutes from where I live.

As for me, I'm married and have a dog. We own a condo in the north end of our city and I commute 45 minutes each way to get to work and back. I also have a lot of hobbies but they're MUCH more sedate, I sew and cross stitch both of which I primarily do as a hobby but I'm getting more and more requests from people who want to pay me to make them things. Right now I'm up to my eyeballs in bridal veils. I'm also a sports fan but purely as a spectator. My SO and I are big hockey fans as well as we're really into motorsports, namely F1 and IndyCar. Also, my SO and I are kinda homebodies and having a dog means that we can't both be out for more than 4-5 hours because of our dog. Also, I'm not fit, I'm not athletic and while not overweight, I could stand to lose about 10lbs. The only regular activity I get is walking. But between walking to the subway and back and walking my dog I usually average a couple of KM a day.

S and I never really hung out much on our own, it was always with other friends. S then had to move to a different city about 8 hours away. It was temporary and S moved back in September of last year. This is where my problem begins.

S's car is undriveable at the moment and she's living 30 minutes outside of the city. We've seen each other a handful of times since she's been back when she reached out to me over the winter to see if I wanted to meet up for bubble tea (its ALWAYS bubble tea as it's one of the only ""treats"" she allows herself.) During this meeting she told me about her ""plan"" for lent. She was going to increase her workouts, stop sleeping in, work on getting a new instrument and improve her archery. Great. Good for her, I was super supportive even if just hearing about it sounded exhausting.

Then she tells me she needs a ""workout buddy"" and suddenly it dawns on me; that's why I'm here. She asks me and I immediately said ""OH HELL NO!"" So we made a pro/con list which I won't even talk about (one of her ""pros"" was I could wear ""cute outfits again"", I've been a Jean's and tshirt kinda girl all my life, and ""cute outfits"" are not motivation to me.) But eventually it came down to my health. I could use the exercise to be honest, so I reluctantly agreed to 3 times a week for 40 days.

The workouts are awful and I hate them but I suck it up and do the 40 days. At the end of it I'm just so relieved, not only that the workouts are over but more so because I don't have to see S 3 times a week anymore. Because I gave in to the workouts, she tried the entire time to try to get me to do other athletic things that I have zero interest in. Including things like: aerial yoga (I've never even done the regular on-the-floor kind), archery (did it as a kid, hated it, no interest in hating it again as an adult) and running a 5K (the only thing I run for is the bus!) I said no to every single one.

So, saying ""NO"" to her is not the problem, it's her reaction that's the issue. Because every single time I say no to an activity or an invite out to do something I get pushback. If I tell her I'm busy and don't have time I get something like ""But there are so many hours in a weekend! You can totally make time for this!"" If I say no because I'm just not interested I get ""How do you even know if you won't try it?""

The other issue is, if I do agree, it's not just a matter of going out, doing the thing and then going back home. No. She somehow finds ways to keep the outing going. Because first of all, I have to drive 30 minutes to pick her up, then 30 minutes or more to wherever her activity is. Then we do the thing for say 2 hours, then she wants to get bubble tea (I am so sick of fucking bubble tea), then she'll try to push me to go to Costco with her (I mean, WHY?!) Then I have to take her back home and then drive myself back. So all of this can easily take up *most of a day*. And this is why I tell her I ""don't have time"" because she is just a massive time sink.

My SO doesn't like her, he sees the way that she tries to railroad me into things despite my saying no. He knows that I always stand up for myself and doesn't like the way she just won't accept ""no"" as an answer.

But lately it's been coming to a head since she's asking me to go do some archery with her almost every weekend for a month. We have a long weekend coming up and I just know she'll ask me to go out and do something with her because it's a 3 day weekend so my ""I don't have time"" excuse is BS.

How do I even deal with this? I'd like to be as polite as possible because I do want to keep her in my life (despite my portrayal she is a lot of fun and I do like spending time with her when she's not trying to get me to do stuff I don't wanna do.) But I have to get through to her that her crazy, busy althetic hobbies are not for me and I have zero interest in joining her in them?

She lived about 9 hours away, and I didn?t see much of anything coming out of it (as in I didn?t really see a future with her). So when I went back home to visit, I ended up connecting and talking with a very sweet girl. Since the other girl loved so far away and I didn?t see a future with her (side note; we never even saw each other in person) I figured I?d say things are over and I?m sorry for putting you through any trouble. 

Fast forward to present day. Me and the said girl have been dating for about a month and some change. I was home for about two weeks, and then had to travel back (we live about 12 hours away - I know even further). Things have been really really good though! We FaceTime every night and always talk/text throughout the day, but if either of us are busy we respect our boundaries and let the other person do their thing. Everything went very sour today..

The girl I was taking to before didn?t like me moving on (we only talked for about a month and a half) and she she started sending screenshots of our texts to my current girlfriend.

I (25/F) have never been in a relationship before my current boyfriend (we'll call him Andrew) simply because I had never met a guy I liked who liked me back. 

I met Andrew at work a 6 months ago, we started talking a little here and there, he then asked for my number, we had 3+ hour-long text chats for a few weeks, he asked me out, and we've officially been bf/gf for 2 months now.

Things have been going really well between us, and I definitely care about him a lot. If we're apart for more than 1-2 days I feel antsy and want to see him, I genuinely feel good and am happy when I'm with him, I am naturally very affectionate with him (I always initiate or reciprocate hand holding, kissing, back massage/touches, etc.), our personalities match well, I frequently find myself staring at him while smiling, etc. I know for a fact he always has my back, he's a genuinely good person, and he's always there to talk with me about stuff.

What has been freaking me out a bit is how much it sounds like he has fallen for me. He's a huge romantic/lovey-dovey type, and he constantly says, ""you're my world,"" ""you're my love,"" ""I've found my person,"" ""I feel whole now that I'm with you,"" ""You have added color to my life,"" etc. It feels nice to hear those things, and while I do care very much for him, I can't say I feel that way about him yet. 

Basically, it makes me nervous that it sounds like he found ""the one"" when I can't say I feel the same (as of right now, at least). Then, with that mindset, I start getting upset at the fact that maybe he's not the right one for me if I can't see myself marrying him/spending the rest of my life with him. And then I beat myself up thinking that I'm leading him on or wasting both of our times. But then I remind myself that this is my first relationship ever and it's only been a couple months (I'm still getting used to saying that I have a boyfriend!). But then I think, ""this is the honeymoon phase, shouldn't I feel head over heels right now? This doesn't bode well for the future??""

He is leaving our home town in a few months for school and it's very unlikely that we would wind up in the same place after that.

And signing up to fall in love with someone who I will probably then never see again seems masochistic. So I explained that though I really liked him I didn't want things to continue and I ended things.

930,questions12344,Dating,3,c5t9w5,2," I?ve (22F) been dating this dude (25) since mid-March for context after meeting on bumble. It's both of our serious first relationships also.

He hasn?t ever invited me to meet his friends even once. I think he doesn't invite me to because he knows I can't be out late but I still feel extremely excluded. And he's ALWAYS telling me, ""my friend and his gf went to X..."" or ""my friend brought his gf etc."" But yet never has thought about asking me if I want to meet his friends. The most recent time we hung out, he showed me some pictures of his friends with their gfs because they had been to the same spot we were at (an island). The thing is, I don't want to make myself look undignified or whatever by being like, ""hey why didn't you invite me?"" you know? I'm scared he'd be like, ""well can you be out late?"" and then I'd just end up feeling like absolute shit about myself. But then

Also, I'm starting to feel like he's just compromising by being with me. I stalked some of those gfs on insta and they're so beautiful and smart. They have amazing instagrams with their bfs in a lot of pictures looking carefree and happy. I, on the other hand, have like <200 followers and post rarely because it's so hard to do things under my parents' roof. I feel extremely inadequate and gross even though my friends say I'm also pretty and smart myself. How do you deal with feelings of extreme jealousy and envy of other people, especially women? I feel like a bad feminist for even having to ask this but it's so hard to be happy for other people when I feel like I have absolutely nothing going for myself, or at least nothing to show for like a full instagram/Facebook. Even if I wanted a better social media presence, it's so hard with my family and how controlling they are.

Lastly, I'm generally just feeling really shitty because I don't know where him and I stand as a couple. I asked him what his ""take"" on our relationship was and he was like, ""what do you mean?"" So I said, ""where do we stand?"" He replied by saying he loves spending time with me etc. But it didn't arrive at where I wanted it to, which was whether we were going to delete our dating apps. I'm supposed to see him tomorrow so I want to bring it up explicitly by saying, ""so, dating apps, are we still doing that?"" I'm extremely nervous that this won't go well though because of how close I've become to him. I'm also not sure if this is all in my head and that maybe we're moving slower than I would like us to. He has introduced me to his sister as I went over a few times to his place when his parents were on vacation and it sounded like he brought me up to his parents one day. We took our first pictures together at this island I mentioned before but I can't seem to feel happy. I struggle with major depression and OCD so that definitely must be playing a role. I just don't know anymore. I'm way too sad. I want to make changes to myself and to my life because these are just things I've wanted for a while but I know it won't happen nearly as fast as I want it to happen. Losing weight and getting nice pictures take time. Looking good in a mini skirt takes time because I have to shave, wax and deal with the look of my stubby knees rubbing against each other. These changes aren't going to happen overnight. Plus, I don't even know if I have the energy or time to work on them because I'm trying to get myself into prestigious graduate programs.

One last thing, I feel stressed because he seems kind of secretive. He doesn't seem to tell me what he's up to on days we aren't seeing each other unless it's related to his family. Also, he kind of turns his phone away from me when he's on it sometimes. I also have no idea what he's up to in life. He doesn't have a job as far as I can tell and he lives with his parents. On our first date he mentioned something about MIT but hasn't brought up anything remotely related to the future in forever. As for the days I don't see him, I always have to ask how his day was etc. but it's like I guess he could make the argument that I don't tell him what I'm up to either. The reason I don't say anything is because I'm either at home or on campus. I have helicopter parents and I live in the middle of nowhere which makes having a normal life for a 22-year old woman extremely difficult.

Anyways, tl;dr I'm feeling extremely trapped in every aspect of my life with no room to breathe. I'm not sure if any of these are red flags but my body hurts from the pain.

931,XRUMAHDX,[new],29,c5t9bx,0,"My boyfriend and I have been together nearly 3 years now. I became sexually active at 18 and have slept with 5 people including him. He became sexually active at 15 and has slept with 13 people including me. He has tried to keep the identities of all his previous partners from me because he says he doesn't think its relevant but I have always thought this was unfair as all of my previous sexual partners have come up organically through just talking about life.

When there is an opportunity for him to also organically explain or identify people he has slept with he will actively avoid it - even so far as to introduce me to his 'friends' and then for me to later find out that the female friend will be someone he has slept with. I only really know anything about his very very serious ex girlfriend of 5 years.

This of course has made me paranoid about meeting any female 'friends' of his and i instantly get insecure at the thought that he has had sex with them but doesn't want to tell me (this situation has happened 3 different times - he has always known in advance that the person has been there and not warned me and then i have found out later that he has slept with them through someone casually bringing it up or asking him after the person has been flirty or overly familiar with him and it has made me suspicious). I really am not usually an insecure person, I have even found it **fun** and intellectually stimulating to talk about other people's partners with my own partners before him.

We recently moved abroad together (we're very serious in our relationship, this is one of the only stumbling blocks we run into). Recently we were talking in a group with 2 of our friends (who are another couple) about one of my boyfriend's old jobs and he showed a picture of him and his colleagues. I jokingly said 'oh everyone fancied you there didn't they' to which he laughed and said no. I then asked him if he had slept with any of the girls in the photo, he laughed louder this time, seemingly insinuating that my question was ludicrous and again said no.

Today, when having what was at first a very therapeutic and productive conversation about the topic of this whole 'exes' ordeal in general, I expressed that it got to me not 'knowing' all the people he had slept with and how it made it worse that I worried I had met all of them etc - he knows everyone I have slept with or at least knows of them, the duration we were together and to what extent i was 'with' them. He offhand listed someone he had slept with them as a girl from **the job** we had been talking about with our friends a week or so ago(?) I was upset and asked why he had lied to me because I knew that very recently I had explicitly asked this question. He denied the fact that it came up recently at first BUT then seemed to remember and said 'well she wasn't in that photo so' - i immediately was hurt and said 'oh good for you, very clever'

He knows full well that I DO NOT stand for the 'just because you **didn't** tell the TRUTH doesn't mean you have LIED' argument. I think it's really devious and nasty, and in a way selfish/tactical/self-preserving.

This is not the first time we've had an argument about this '*i didn't tell you the truth because it was awkward but now you can't actually say i lied to you'* concept - (i think this was a petty tactic he used a lot with his very immature ex - he has hinted this) he has apologised and insisted he has changed since the beginning HOWEVER finding out he did it AGAIN after we have moved to another country together/VERY RECENTLY has really got to me.

I have gone to work in another room (we both work from home) and am spending some time away from him to calm down but I am still feeling very mixed up. Literally any advice or words would be of comfort. Trying really hard not to get into my old ways of a self harm spiral. I get into a headspace of 'I must do something to deserve to be disrespected like this' and then start thinking that i will deliberately starve myself or even cut myself for some relief/control.

EDIT: I know that people's opinion can be that since it happened before me it shouldn't be any of my concern - to reiterate didn't have a boyfriend until i was EIGHTEEN, the concept of sleeping with people you can't even remember the names of is alien to me which is why I'm interested to know how/what/who - it is starkly different to my own experience

933,FancyBuilder4,Relationships,53,c5t8z3,0,"tldr: I (39m) met a younger woman (24f) and am contemplating starting a life with her. Is this crazy? My wife (39f) and marriage is otherwise acceptable, but I'm not happy, not fulfilled, and unsure of what to do to fix any of this.

&#x200B;

Met my wife when I was 20 and she was 19. I didn't have great self esteem at the time and was just getting out of a long term (>1 year) relationship where I was taken for granted and neglected a bit. She actually paid attention to me. Actually enjoyed my company. And I couldn't get enough of her. We dated/were engaged for 7 years, and have been married for 12 years now. I've never been particularly faithful, but I've never thought of leaving my wife before. Where we have some sexual incompatibilities, we have a lot of other things in common, and I've never sought out anyone else to fill any emotional or social holes in me. 

Our marriage is fine. Outwardly it looks great. We co-parent well. We have achieved most of the material things we are supposed to and have a supportive, fun marriage from the outside. On the inside... it's less perfect. Like it's \*fine\*, but it's lonely. She goes to bed early, like 8PM or earlier, and spend her nights reading and/or watching TV. I spend my night downstairs hanging out, watching TV, playing video games, etc., and we never really spend time together anymore. We have sex once a month (far too little for my tastes), and it's a quick, intense thing. Sometimes I want more - intimacy, foreplay, connection. She likes to be fucked hard and fast and then resume our evening. So I'm feeling horribly disconnected at times at home, but no amount of talking seems to improve things. We discuss these things. She sympathizes. Nothing changes. My wife is still beautiful and I'm attracted to her, but emotionally, there's a space there that I can't seem to bridge.

I've gotten in the habit of looking for girls to fool around with, or just chat with, on Omegle. They're always quick, transitory encounters that rarely if ever repeat. Which is fine, it fills a hole for me. Until, 2 years ago, I meet this girl. She lives across the country from me. She's 22, and beautiful in all the ways a 22 year old is. And I'm open with her about my situation, and we don't fuck around on Omegle, but we DO start talking, each and every day, for a month. And we fall in love. Head over heels. And there's some drama, because she can't have me, and sees me being unhappy and unfulfilled at home, but sees I can't choose her because I have a family and she doesn't want to break that. She has issues that I've helped her work through, because life seems to have been horribly unfair to her at times, and she thrives when we can just love and dote on each other. And I do too - I become happier, start taking care of myself better, am a more empathetic parent, and partner at times. 

We've had 3 opportunities over the past 2 years to be in the same physical space together, and spent 2 whole days and nights together. And those experiences, while heightened emotionally, were everything I could have hoped and more. We have such a strong connection, both emotionally and physically. Like I get it, it's ridiculous, to be this carried away, but I'm totally carried away. I love my wife, but I'm IN LOVE with this girl. And still am, 2 years later. It's not getting better, it's getting worse. 

And my marriage hasn't been doing better. It hasn't really got worse, except I harass my wife less for company or sex since I'm spending basically every evening on the couch Skyping with my girlfriend, so there's been even less contact or companionship. My wife doesn't seem to mind much. She enjoys the quiet time. She enjoys the time to do what she wants. And I'm generally happier, so what could be wrong, right?

So here I am, contemplating separating from my wife, splitting time with my kids, and inviting my girlfriend to move across the country to be with me (which I know she'll accept, in a heartbeat, after accepting the fact that I'm finally making this change). I know I should be separating because of what **I** want, what's right for **ME**. And maybe a part of me is, but I know if I didn't have this other girl, I wouldn't even be contemplating it, I would just be enjoying my standard mid-life crisis and jerking off to random girls on the internet while being generically unhappy at home.

I'm open to any and all sorts of thoughts an opinions. Harsh, gentle, supportive, whatever you got.

Consider this scenario:

A guy fell in love with his female co-worker whom has a BF.

Both have things in common and like to talk to each other.

the female co-worker physically and mentally is attracted to the guy because he is very similar to her BF (take this as a fact).

The   guy accepted that nothing will ever happen between them as she is   already in a very long term relationship. (and she is loyal, as it   should be)

However, poor guy, has feelings for her which hurt him.

What is the guy suppose to do in this situation?

Tell her his feelings to let it out? (do you think she has to know about it?)

Ignore her to some extend? (as just continue talking and engaging with her will probably only make the feelings stronger)

A couple months ago, one of my closest friends (3 years old friendship) told me he had feelings for me (I?ll call him F). I was surprised, and kind of upset to be honest. F was one of my closest friends! And this was not respectful of me, my BF, or my relationship. It baffled me that he would ever do that. I rejected him. Told my boyfriend about what happened and F and I no longer speak because of the whole ordeal. Even though it hurt to lose a friend like that, and sometimes I miss talking to him like we used to, it was what had to be done. A few weeks ago I heard that F had started seeing a girl from our university, and I was genuinely happy, even felt relieved.

Now to the issue, last weekend a friend in common held a birthday party. I could not attend because I had another birthday party the same day, and I chose to attend to the latter. The next day, I was watching some Instagram stories and stumbled upon a lot of pictures and videos from the party I did not attend to. Everyone looked like they were having fun. Then, I came across a video of F talking to this girl, holding her from the waist, and being affectionate. I felt a pang of something (jealousy?) in my gut. I closed the app and haven?t stopped thinking about it since. It?s been a couple of days. What the hell? Why am I jealous? I don?t even know if it is jealousy, I just know that it made me feel really uncomfortable. I have never had any feelings for F, haven?t talked to him in months besides a ?hello? when we cross paths at UNI, and I love my BF very much.

So, what?s happening here? What can I do to stop this weird pang of whatever? I have no intentions whatsoever to start talking to F again. I want to nip this shit right from the bud. Any advice is welcome.

937,questions12344,Dating,3,c5t44d,2," This is sort of a rant of my thoughts because I'm feeling like absolute horse shit about myself, and my life in general.

The dude and I have been dating since mid-March for context after meeting on bumble. It's both of our serious first relationships also.

I think he doesn't invite me to these things because he knows I can't be out late but I still feel extremely excluded. And he's ALWAYS telling me, ""my friend and his gf went to X..."" or ""my friend brought his gf etc."" But yet never has thought about asking me if I want to meet his friends. The most recent time we hung out, he showed me some pictures of his friends with their gfs because they had been to the same spot we were at (an island). The thing is, I don't want to make myself look undignified or whatever by being like, ""hey why didn't you invite me?"" you know? I'm scared he'd be like, ""well can you be out late?"" and then I'd just end up feeling like absolute shit about myself. But then

Also, I'm starting to feel like he's just compromising by being with me. I stalked some of those gfs on insta and they're so beautiful and smart. They have amazing instagrams with their bfs in a lot of pictures looking carefree and happy. I, on the other hand, have like <200 followers and post rarely because it's so hard to do things under my parents' roof. I feel extremely inadequate and gross even though my friends say I'm also pretty and smart myself. How do you deal with feelings of extreme jealousy and envy of other people, especially women? I feel like a bad feminist for even having to ask this but it's so hard to be happy for other people when I feel like I have absolutely nothing going for myself, or at least nothing to show for like a full instagram/Facebook. Even if I wanted a better social media presence, it's so hard with my family and how controlling they are.

Lastly, I'm generally just feeling really shitty because I don't know where him and I stand as a couple. I asked him what his ""take"" on our relationship was and he was like, ""what do you mean?"" So I said, ""where do we stand?"" He replied by saying he loves spending time with me etc. But it didn't arrive at where I wanted it to, which was whether we were going to delete our dating apps. I'm supposed to see him tomorrow so I want to bring it up explicitly by saying, ""so, dating apps, are we still doing that?"" I'm extremely nervous that this won't go well though because of how close I've become to him. I'm also not sure if this is all in my head and that maybe we're moving slower than I would like us to. He has introduced me to his sister as I went over a few times to his place when his parents were on vacation and it sounded like he brought me up to his parents one day. We took our first pictures together at this island I mentioned before but I can't seem to feel happy. I struggle with major depression and OCD so that definitely must be playing a role. I just don't know anymore. I'm way too sad. I want to make changes to myself and to my life because these are just things I've wanted for a while but I know it won't happen nearly as fast as I want it to happen. Losing weight and getting nice pictures take time. Looking good in a mini skirt takes time because I have to shave, wax and deal with the look of my stubby knees rubbing against each other. These changes aren't going to happen overnight. Plus, I don't even know if I have the energy or time to work on them because I'm trying to get myself into prestigious graduate programs.

One last thing, I feel stressed because he seems kind of secretive. He doesn't seem to tell me what he's up to on days we aren't seeing each other unless it's related to his family. Also, he kind of turns his phone away from me when he's on it sometimes. I also have no idea what he's up to in life. He doesn't have a job as far as I can tell and he lives with his parents. On our first date he mentioned something about MIT but hasn't brought up anything remotely related to the future in forever. As for the days I don't see him, I always have to ask how his day was etc. but it's like I guess he could make the argument that I don't tell him what I'm up to either. The reason I don't say anything is because I'm either at home or on campus. I have helicopter parents and I live in the middle of nowhere which makes having a normal life for a 22-year old woman extremely difficult.

I'm just utterly mentally fatigued.

My dad has always wanted me to take over the family business when the time is right. But I have made it very clear to him on multiple occasions that I don't want to but it feels like he's just ignoring my pleas.

The restaurant has provided my family with a good life but it's just too stressful. I can tell my dad is getting tired too. He worked really hard to build up the place over the years therefore he doesnt want to let all that hardwork go to waste. He keeps telling me that it's hard to find a job out there and I can always count on the security of the restaurant.

But I just can't right now. I want my freedom. I want to work the jobs I want and do the things I want while I'm still young.

We?re working on it and if it comes down to it and starts creating issues, my husband and I are in full agreement that she will not have a relationship with any of the girls if she doesn?t make an effort to have a relationship with all of them. ?We still feel that we?re making progress on that front, so we haven?t really had to approach the nuclear option.

Last year, he and the kids went on vacation with my parents to go see my sister and nieces in South Carolina. ?He also uses my mother as his babysitter on days during the week that he has the kids. They all go to church together every Sunday. The point is, he and my mother have a close relationship.


I do not have a good relationship with my mother- mostly because of how she handled the whole divorce thing. ?She made it very clear that if there are sides, she was on my ex?s side. She has also, since I?ve been remarried, made it very clear that she doesn?t want to have anything to do with my family. ?She used to invite me and girls over for dinner, making it very clear that my husband and ?his kids? aren?t invited. I went once while we were dating and said never again, that we come as a package deal or not at all.


She?s had over a year to get on board with this, and frankly I?m getting a little fed up with it. ?I?ve been trying to work with her to fix our relationship, baby steps and all that. She has said that she?s not happy with our relationship and wishes that we could be closer. ?So in April, I invited her over to the house for #4?s birthday. I told her I would make cake and we could have ice cream, no pressure, casual event. I told her let me know one way or the other if she?s going to come.


Days go by and that morning I texted her and said, ?Hey, so I didn?t hear from you whether you wanted to come by tonight, so I guess we?ll just reschedule for another time.? ?She texted back and accused me of ?uninviting her.? I told her that wasn?t the case, just that if I had known she was coming, I would have had to make a cake the night before. ?I offered to still have her come over and suggested if she wanted, she could grab ice cream or something on the way and we could still all celebrate together, but since I was working all day, there wasn?t a whole lot I could provide for the celebration at this point. ?She said that we?ll just do it another time.


I found it pretty rude that she hadn?t bothered to get back to me at all and TBH kind of checked out a bit. ?To me, this was an olive branch. She hadn?t met the other two girls, it was low pressure, maybe an hour to an hour and a half of time to come over and see her grandkids for #4?s birthday. ?


So a couple of weeks ago, my sister had a baby and my mom posted about it on FB. ?She was so excited for grandbaby #12. Except, when you count my stepkids, it?s actually #14. ?She made a huge fuss about how the grandkids are evenly split- boys vs. girls- except that if she were counting *everyone*, not just her ?real? grandkids, there are 2 more girls.


I was kind of pissed and was ready to just call it and cut her off. ?I have no leverage- like, if you want to have a relationship with my kids, you have to have a relationship with all of my kids- because the ex gives her everything she needs as far as time with #2 and #4. ?I was really close to calling it quits.


Then she texted me last week when she got back from vacation and said she really missed the girls and asked if she could watch them on Friday, when I?m usually working. ?I said that since I was home that day (babysitter went on a mission trip) she?s more than welcome to come over and spend time with all of us. 


To my surprise, she actually did. ?She came over and met everyone, we all went to the park together and went out for Frosty?s. ?The other 2 were apprehensive at first, but #1 was excited to show off her sketchbook and #3 talked my mom?s ear off the entire time. ?They seemed to have a really good time and I texted my mom and told her that. She brushed it off saying that they only like her bc she bought Frosty?s and I said no, #3 especially had a really good time talking to her and really came out of her shell with her. ?She said that she was really funny and left it at that.


I had told my mom while we were hanging out that #1 was having surgery that coming Tuesday (yesterday) and it wasn?t a minor surgery. ?She and I talked about it and she was more than aware that it was coming up 4 days from then. 


Yesterday came and went (everything went fine, no surprises) and I guess I hoped that she would make some kind of effort, just a text to find out how everything went, if #1 is doing ok, whatever. ?Nothing. I know that it was my fault for getting my hopes up that she would think about the other 2 girls at all and not just her ?real? grandkids, but I shouldn?t have been surprised that she didn?t.


My problem now is that I?m having a baby in 3 months with my new husband. ?I don?t want her to be in this baby?s life if she can?t make an effort with the kids we already have. ?And maybe she doesn?t have any interest anyway, because she never asks how things are going, how I?m feeling, etc. ?So maybe it?s a non-issue, but I don?t know what to do at this point. My husband says that I?ve done what I can, that I should just ghost her and cut her off. ?I feel like it?s worth a conversation saying, hey if you have any interest in having a relationship with me or this baby, it?s time to piss or get off the pot. Accept us all or don?t, but it?s time to choose whether you?re on board or not. And then I wonder if I?m just using my new baby as leverage or bait to get what I want which is partly a relationship with my mom. ?On the other hand, I feel like my life would be a lot less complicated without her in it, so do I really want her around in the first place?

943,stupidmale997,[new],22,c5sua4,42,"I recently left a rocky and somewhat-toxic relationship with my fiancee. I loved her, and tried so hard to make it work, but it just wouldn't. She had a lot of emotional issues that she needed to work out on her own, and I just really wasn't able to be my own person. So I left. This was in April, and I've felt...fine. More relief than anything. I don't miss her, I don't think about her etc. I've been the happiest version of my self in years ,and multiple people have told me this.

So I decided to get on Bumble. Had a few matches, but nothing serious. Then one day I came across a profile that I felt an attraction to that I hadn't to others. So I matched and waited. From the second we matched we were talking nonstop all weekend, and even ended up calling each other on Sunday.

I had made a mental note of everything I wished my fiancee had, and I was finding it in this new girl. We had the same interests, she worked in the same field, she was far and away the most gorgeous girl I've dated, she lived close by (My fiancee's family lived across the country, which caused issues.) She essentially hit every check box.

She seemed *super* into me as well. She told me she felt pulled towards me in a way she hadn't felt in a long time, we made jokes that sort of lended themselves to long term relationships (""We can totally watch all those movies together, as long as you don't care if I fall asleep!"" kind of talk). While I admit that I got waaaaay too invested and way too quick, I was really only picking up what she was putting down.

We were both super busy so we set a date for two weeks from now. However, I cleared some plans on Monday and was able to meet that night - short notice but she agreed to it.

For whatever reason things felt off the second she sat down. She told me she was an introvert and got nervous even talking to me on the phone, so the whole night I just kept telling myself it was her nerves. However, it felt like she just talked about herself and didn't really ask me anything (which she also did on the phone, but it just felt a bit less offputting).

We took a walk and she was almost completely silent, so I just ended it and gave her a hug. I was straight up with her and texted her telling her I wasn't quite sure how she felt, but I really did want to see where this went. Not really alluding to the fact that the date didn't go so well, because at this point I was still thinking she was nervous.

That was a few days ago and I still haven't heard a peep. So I've definitely been ghosted, and this is the worst I've felt in probably years. I'm sure I wasn't quite ready to jump into the game, but I feel like my emotions between leaving my LTR and this new girl are completely separate. For whatever reason I'm just *incredibly* vulnerable, and it feels like I can't get back to my state I was in prior to this ghosting. I feel like I can never get back to that happiness I felt *just last week* because of a girl I knew for a fucking weekend.

Logically, none of this makes sense. Obviously she just didn't feel a connection, I barely knew her, move on. But for whatever reason it's sending my anxiety into a tailspin and I'm having a hard time regrouping. I'm skipping meals, not sleeping, etc. ***Over someone I knew for 4 fucking days***. It's driving me absolutely nuts. I even prepped myself for ghosting because I knew how common it was. But you don't expect someone who says things like: ""I miss you and yet I haven't even met you yet"" to fucking ghost you after a single date.

Not sure what to do. My biggest fear is that I can't regain my composure and the calm I felt. It's like when you're having a panic attack and your afraid that you'll never feel normal again. I tried to get right back onto Bumble but I'm just now comparing every fucking girl to the girl I just met. So please, don't lecture me on why I shouldn't get invested. I know! None of this makes sense to my rational mind.

It's insane, I'm insane. Not sure what to do.

I haven't seen my older cousin for many years and i don't really know her that well. This would have been a great opportunity to catch up.

This was the first time I've ever been outside the country so a lot of the international airport customs were new to me, yet the boys would get scolded for being lazy. We would reply with ""ok"" and ""sorry"" and rush our butts to make up for it. I tried explaining once why I did what I did starting with ""I agree with you and I will look out for that in the future, but explanation here"" and I got shot down hard. I never talked back again. This would happen repeatedly over the course of one week on things like ""why didn't you ask for towels for all of us"" even though asking for literally 16 towels while everyone else in line gets 2 per person is kind of ridiculous and ""why didn't you screenshot the gate tickets if you don't have international data"" and other scoldings. I assume they want to prepare us for the real world in their own way, but the way the older cousin does it is completely abrasive while her mom is more understanding.

A few months into the relationship, he mentioned there was a girl from a different city who was interested in him, and had even drove out to hang out with him one night (during the time that he & I were starting to see eachother), but he swore nothing happened. He told me that she had continued to hit on him and even suggested that she drive out to spend the night at his place, but he told her no, since he was in a relationship. Since we were still in the early stages of the relationship, I didn't make a big deal of this and decided to take his word for it, since I knew we both felt serious about eachother and wanted to build trust. I assumed that he would cut off contact with her, considering we were in an exclusive monogamous relationship.

&#x200B;

Anyway, skip to many months later, and we're cuddling on the couch, scrolling through dumb facebook videos together - and he gets a DM notification from Instagram. I jokingly asked ""who's that"", not thinking anything of it, and he replied ""oh, just a friend from \[other city\]."" Slightly alarmed, I asked if it was this girl he had mentioned, and he weakly responded ""uhhhhh no"", but then immediately after, he said that yes, it was her.

I don't care if he talks to exes or female friends, we have a really loving & trusting relationship in general & jealousy is not an issue... He insists that they're just ""friends"" and that he only talks to her because she's ""nice"" and ""easy to talk to"".

949,SonoftheMorning,[new],5,c5sjo2,0,"I?m very close with my grandmother, who lived with us while I grew up. She?s been battling multiple health serious issues for the last few years. I?ve spent a huge amount of time with her in the hospital, in rehabilitation facilities, and at her home during that time. A couple of months ago, I had to cancel my grad school graduation party and my birthday party because she was in the hospital, along with five or six other weekend trips(I take road trips ~2 times per month). I was totally ok with cancelling these because they are logistically easy to reschedule and to be honest, I would much rather be there with her than celebrate myself or enjoy a road trip.

Recently, she?s been admitted to the hospital and is battling renal failure and an infection. She has chosen not to do dialysis, so unless her kidneys kick in again (sounds crazy, but her kidneys have done this before), she will pass away in the next few weeks. I have been at the hospital every day since she?s been there for at least two hours, sometimes as many as 6 or 7 while working full-time. It?s difficult but I want to be there for her as much as I can.

I have been planning a three-week trip to pursue a passion of mine, which starts in two days. This trip would take me to the other side of the planet. I believe that the trip insurance on my credit card will reimburse me for my non-refundable expenses if I were to cancel. Due to the nature of the trip, I would be unable to reschedule in the near future and would have to hope for 2020 or 2021. Additionally, two of my friends who are coming with me on this trip are relying on my knowledge and language skills, as I am the ?mastermind? of the trip. I believe they would still be able to go without me, but likely would have to spend extra money for local logistical support.

Two nights ago, I spoke with my grandmother about it. In her typical, selfless fashion, she told me that I should go on my trip, and she doesn?t want me to change my plans. 

Today, I must make a decision. Do I stay, or do I go? I?m so painfully torn over this, it really feels like the hardest decision I?ve ever had to make. On one hand, I want to be here for my grandma as well as my other immediate family members. On the other hand, this trip is a chance to pursue my dreams - I might only do a trip like this once. Could I still enjoy my trip knowing that she is suffering? Could I live with my decision if she passes while I?m gone?

We flew out to Los Angeles for a getaway and the plan was to just get a nice hotel and do all sorts of things like go to the beach, sight-see, eat at fancy restaurants and all of the typical L.A. stuff. But this past weekend in the middle of the trip, we were walking back to our hotel from a restaurant and we stopped at this nearby dessert place that sells Italian ice. We both got a little cup and when I asked her what flavor she got, she said ""Wild cherry."" I responded with ""That's the most wild we've been all trip.""

I honestly didn't mean anything by that comment. It was just a little quip and that's just how I am. But she apparently took offense to that comment and she starts asking me ""What's that suppose to mean?"" I told her that it didn't mean anything, but she kept asking me ""What? Am I not wild enough for you? Are you unhappy with the trip so far?"" She then starts asking me what she has to do to prove that she's ""wild enough"" for the trip. She starts screaming at me about how she's going to strip naked and streak through the hotel lobby to prove that our trip is ""wild"" and I kept telling her to calm down. She ends up throwing her ice at me, says ""We're suppose to be having a fun trip, not a wild one!"" We didn't talk for the rest of the night.

 The next day, she woke up without me to go get breakfast and by the time I had gotten to the buffet, she was already finishing up her food and she just walked by me without saying a word to me. Later that day, she was lying out by the pool and I went to join her. I sat in the chair next to her, she saw me, and said that she wants alone time. I told her to stop ignoring me and to talk to me about our fight, but she responded with ""Why? I'm not wild enough for you, remember?"" She gets up to walk away, but my anger got the best of me and I shoved her in the pool. She was screaming about how much of I jerk I am and people were staring at us fight.

951,ReasonableSorbet,Relationships,3,c5si7g,3,"Hello r/relationships. I would like to share my thoughts and feelings about my current relationship with my lovely partner.

I think some people might enjoy to believe, that there isn't anything more chivalrous about someone who ""steps down"" to ""the people"" and ""saves"" one out of poverty.

Even though I manage my image well, I can't say that I don't feel insecure about my upbringing. I feel intimidated by people who had a ""normal"" life, especially with some of those who are ignorant.

This vulnerability is a part of me and my partner witnessed it, but he can't quite grasp it.

There are a few things that bother me a lot.

1. I wish my partner would take some time and immerse himself in my culture. It's mostly me who compromises with my insecurities and hangs out with his circle of friends, who are great and sensitive people, but I can't lie and say I didn't feel intimidated, and I could be myself around them. I feel ashamed of my poor vocabulary (in comparison to them. Some I feel may be outright condescending, when they love to have long intellectual debates).

I wish I could say things in my native language and be natural. They don't like my russian music, and I did get a racist thing said from one of his friends. My partner stepped up for me and I feel very thankful.

I wish he could learn some words, which I think isn't a big task if only he would care enough. I set up duolingo for him and guided him through some lessons. I also wrote him some nice words which are easy to remember and could be helpful for his everyday life (He does work with russians). And another thing that I feel bitter about- Most people I know who aren't russian still know some words, and like to throw them around when we hang out. There I don't feel like an outsider, and I love it that we are all connected through our cultures (All of my friends are also ""not native"", and we share all our languages).

2. He has mood swings sometimes, where he is gets emotional, like all human beings. He says he thinks he is a bad person, that he hurts me, and is not good enough for anything. I feel him and love to assure and tell him just how much of an amazing human being he is. (I really hope that he will believe in it a little too sometimes). He appreciates it.

Anyway Those mood swings always get to a point that he says he wants us to break up. We both know they never mean that he doesn't love me or really wants us to part. It's a great opportunity to share our fears, even if some words come out as extreme and some thoughts aren't so rational, we are still human and should be able to vent some of our deep feelings.

But there are a few things that he said that hurt me deeply.

* One was that he said he doesn't want to stay with me because I probably have ""bad genetics""- as both my parents were depressed and I suffer with depression too. He doesn't want our child to suffer.
* The second was that he said he is scared that if we were to break up, I would get with a guy who will be bad for me and hurt me.

&#x200B;

I told him (after the storm of course) that those things hurt me, he understood me and apologized. Yet, I think we should work on this in another way- make him understand he is not responsible for me or my actions. To understand that even though I share my vulnerability, I am not a weak person. I wish he could treat me more equally.

&#x200B;

Do you have any ideas to approach this?  How to maybe create a safe place for him to explore my world without intimidating him, offending him, or making him feel unwanted?

954,thrwythrwy123123,Relationships,1,c5scn9,2,"A little bit of background about my family and my parents to understand who they are and how they act: I grew up in an East Asian household -- my parents weren't always strict, they were loving, and always wanted the best for me, my younger brother (M18) and my older sister (M25). However, throughout the years, it was apparent that my parents' communication to us, their children, was not always the best. They both are very passive (mainly my father), and it is hard for them to express themselves. Whenever we have problems, my parents usually sweep things under the rug, let tensions rise, until one of them (90% of the time is my dad) explodes. My dad has never been the best at sharing his thoughts. He claims that he doesn't want to tell my siblings and I certain things/share his opinion because he's afraid it will hurt our feelings. My dad has a temper, and when he goes off, he just starts saying hurtful things. I think the way he reacts comes from how he was raised by my grandparents, who are also passive and never speak about their problems. In my family, we have always catered to my dad's wants/feelings. If we go out to eat, it always has to be a place that my dad likes otherwise he won't eat or have a good time. And if he doesn't have a good time, my mom worries. My mom also accommodates to him. For as long as I can remember, my mom like watching Asian movies, but my dad doesn't. Since he has verbally told her that he thinks those movies are pointless/dumb, she does not watch them around him. Sometimes I'll come home, and she'll turn off the computer, realize I'm not my dad, and say, ""I thought you were your father."" Then she turns back on the computer and continues watching. I've asked her multiple times why she doesn't watch freely around him and she just shrugs it off. I have a good relationship with my mother, and I spend time with her more than I spend time with my dad. Often at home, I'll come downstairs and greet  my dad, but he ignores. A lot of times when I ask him questions, he'll ignore me or shrug it off. So there's barely conversation between us except for the usual ""how's college?"" Since I graduated, he recently asked if I wanted to start learning about finances with him. I agreed eagerly since I thought it would be a great way for us to bond (important).

&#x200B;

My parents don't have the best relationship with my brother. For the last couple of years of his high school experience, they've been really on him for good grades, getting a good SAT score, getting into a good college. Even though that's done now, the way they approached him about it was never good. My dad expresses his frustrations by telling my brother how he thinks he's a know-it-all and acts like he's better than them. Admittedly, my brother does have attitude problems sometimes, but he's been trying to work on it. After years of tension and not directly talking to my brother about how my Dad wants him to be the best he can be, my brother is just stoic around them, which makes them upset (because he doesn't show empathy or shows that he cares about anything). During those times, I was away at college, and my older sister was at home. She would usually serve as the mediator even though it was emotionally draining for her. My parents would ask her to tell my brother something for them. She finally moved out a couple of months ago to be closer to her work, but also because she couldn't stand being at home anymore.

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago (relevant to my situation), I woke up at 1:00 AM to hear my dad yelling at my brother in his room. After texting my sister, asking her what to do, I decided to intervene. When I came into the room and asked what was happening, my dad flipped on me, telling me, in an aggressive manner, that him and my brother were just talking. By brother was just seated, looking straight ahead and his eyes looked dead. I think by now, since he's been yelled at like this so many times, he just accepts it, and just let's my dad yell it out until it's over. Anyways, I told my dad he woke me up, and he yelled at me saying, ""We're just talking. Why don't you go back to sleep if we're bothering you?!"" And I responded calmly, ""I can't because you're yelling."" Then I tried to mediate the situation, asking what was happening. My dad just spewed out how he thinks my brother acts like he's better than the family, how he has a bad attitude. He just kept yelling, and my brother was just nodding. My mom came over and was agreeing with my dad (she usually does). Finally, I wanted to hear my brother's side, so I managed to get my dad out of his room, locking the door. My brother finally blew up, saying  how he has tried to change for them but nothing works, he doesn't talk with them because they're always upset, and that when he goes to college, he's done with talking to them. After my dad tried to knock on the door repeatedly and me asking my mom to take him back to bed, he was gone. For about a half an hour, my brother just vented to me, and I suggested therapy and writing in a journal to process these emotions and he reluctantly agreed. I emphasized to him that he should not let this go, and try to talk to our parents, since we both knew that the next day, they would act like nothing happened. And that's exactly what happened. I was pissed because my dad didn't even apologize to me for yelling at me when all I did was try to help. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, I came home from hanging out with some friends. My parents were out in our deck talking and relaxing. I came out to say hello, and my dad (apparently a little buzzed/drunk?) started talking to me about finances. He can go on, and on when he's really passionate about something. I was too exhausted to listen to a lecture, because he was trying to discuss some financial terminology.  So I cut him off, and said, ""Dad, can we talk about this at another time? I'm kind of tired."" And he was like, ""Alright. Just go to sleep."" Before I left, I wanted to ask my mom what was up with her because I hadn't seen her the whole day. While I was asking her, my dad was muttering ""go to sleep."" Near the end of her talking about her day, he cut her off and start talking about finances. I stopped him short, and said, ""Dad, you just cut mom off? She was talking."" My mom was like, ""No it's fine, I was done anyway."" And he was like ""Alright, alright."" He was obviously upset, and I just said that I was going to go to bed. As I was leaving, I asked if he was okay, and I told him I hoped I didn't hurt his feelings. His response: ""It just seems like you're not interested in this, and more interested about your mom."" And I told him I wasn't in the mood to talk about finances, and I didn't see mom all day, so I wanted to see what was up with her. Then things got messy. He just started saying how ""In general, I don't want to get people to get interested in things, and then waste their time to only realize they're not interested."" And in my mind, I knew he was being passive about me. So I responded, I am interested in learning with you about finances, or ""Do you think I'm not interested? If I'm not I will tell you I'm not."" And he immediately said, ""I'm not talking about you -- I'm saying in general."" Obviously he was meaning me? Because then he tried to give me an example, saying how my brother is currently interested in playing an instrument, but he knows he's going to lose interest within the next week or two. And he doesn't like it when things like that happen. The context of that situation is clearly related to the situation that was currently happening. I asked him why he couldn't flat out just tell me that he doesn't want me to think I'm disinterested about learning finances with him. He got mean, turned to my mom while pointing at me, ""Why is she so stubborn? I'm not talking about her.""

It just got really messy, and pretty much I was telling him that he's being passive, he's obviously talking about me, and that if he has a problem, he can just directly say it, without referencing a separate situation.  Things escalated because he wouldn't listen to me, and then I snapped. Generally, when talking with him about problems, I end up crying because it's so frustrating to talk to him. So I'm crying, and gradually raising my voice, explaining how all this could have been avoided if he just directly said that he was hurt that I didn't want to talk about finances tonight. He just dismissed me, and I told him this is the same thing he was doing with my brother during that one night, and how he's always so passive. In that moment, I started ranting about how he doesn't communicate in a healthy way, he always just yells or walks away in hard situations. At a point, he pretty much said he had to take out the trash, and then I pointed out how he was walking away again. He said he couldn't talk to me because I was too upset, and that when he's upset, he says things that are too mean or things he doesn't mean. He also said I'd always been too sensitive or I get hurt too easily, and that he knows when I am upset based on my body language (example: apparently I turn around a certain way when I'm upset?) I didn't know that, and even if I did, why didn't they ever talk to me about it? There's no communication with my parents. 

&#x200B;

My mom kept saying that we were having a nice conversation, and then I made this whole problem up. She said I should have just left when my dad told me to go to sleep. I told her that he was obviously upset, so I wanted to talk to him about it. And also, if I had left, it would just mean that I am sweeping things under the rug, just like them.

&#x200B;

I had some more back-and-forth conversations with my dad, with me saying he has no healthy communication except for being passive, and him saying that I'm too upset, and that he cannot talk because I keep cutting him off (even when he would do the same). I tried to stay calm by sitting down, speaking slowly. When I would let him finish, I would respond, but by trying to tell him why I think what he's saying is false, he would throw his hand up in the air, look to my mom, and say, ""Do you see this? She's not listening."" I began texting my sister, asking if I could stay over at her place because I didn't want to be at home. My dad points at the phone and says, ""I hate when people do that. Your brother does that and it bothers me."" I put the phone down, and said, ""This is the perfect example of what I'm talking about. Instead of being passive, why don't you ask me to put the phone down because it bothers you? Instead of bringing in a different situation?"" I know I was wrong to text while we were talking and I admitted that.  His response was that because it's just his personality and he's not good at talking.

&#x200B;

He proceeded to tell me that when he gets in fights with my mom, he won't talk to her the next day, and then through his body language, he'll ""send a message"" that everything's all good and he's not mad anymore, when she apparently understands. I told him that I'm not mom, my brother isn't like my mom, and my sister isn't like my mom -- and that he can't expect us to assume that we know what he means if he doesn't verbally communicate that. My mom agreed, but he kept brushing it off. I think he knew he was wrong. After awhile, he just left, and I asked why he keeps leaving, and he said that he won't talk to me until I'm calm. 

&#x200B;

My mom kept emphasizing that everything was fine until I stirred up trouble, and my dad kept saying I was too sensitive. I feel like they were gaslighting me. I told my mom I was going to leave. At first she wasn't going to let me but she knew that since I'm not a minor, she couldn't stop me. So I left with my car keys, wallet, phone, and charger. I drove off, calling my partner, friends, and sister for support. My best friend (F22), T, answered, and I picked her up. I vented to her and she told me I was in the right and was valid for feeling like this. I dropped her back to her place.  

Then I decided to go to my partner's (M22) house. My parents tried texting and calling me. I declined their calls and texted that I was staying at my partner's place, and that I needed space. My mom was more concerned about how her and my dad would come off to my partner and his family. Texts pretty much went like this:

Me: I'm safe. At \[partner\]'s.

Mom: Did you tell him about our fight?

Me: Please, I need space right now. Right now I'm safe.

Mom: I hope you didn't tell his parents too. I don't want to see \[partner\] anymore because I'm so embarrassed for our family. I don't want him to think us as bad parents because I know I am now. Whatever you think of us, we love you very much.

Me: I love you both but I need space right now please.

Mom: What is \[partner\]'s address? Please

&#x200B;

They then called me 3 times. The last time, I picked up and my mom and dad tried to guilt me into coming back home (""If you love us, you'll come home.""; ""\[Partner\] has no respect for us if you stay.""; ""You're going to disrespect your mom like that?""). I just repeatedly told them that I was safe, and that I needed space. They said that I could have as much space as long as I was at home. I told them I wasn't going to come home. They threatened to call the police, and I told them not to, and that they and the police wouldn't be able to since I'm not a minor. They told me they would keep driving around until they found my partner's house. After the millionth time of asking them to respect my decision, and emphasizing that I'm safe and I need space, they hung up.

&#x200B;

Now it's the next day. I haven't come home yet, and I'm sitting at the public library writing this. They tried to text me again to come out for lunch with them but I didn't reply. My sister texted me, saying that she told my parents that I should sleep over at my partner's last night since she lived far away (45 minute drive). She said they're mad that I didn't come home, but she was happy to take the blame for that. She also told them that she thought it was good for me to get space outside of home. 

&#x200B;

I need advice on how I should talk to them when I come home. I don't want to brush this to the side like how my parents usually do. These communication issues have been deeply rooted within our family for years. I think they knew I was right but didn't want to change or admit it. How can I express to them that while I love them, I want them to communicate in a healthier way?

I'm working in software development and all my work friends are guys, I've grown apart from my college friend group as we all graduated and moved to different places. and I really don't do a lot of activities that help me make friends, I like reading and hiking, and backpacking with my boyfriend Alex. Most of my social life is going out to happy hours or parties with my guy friends from work.

Plus Alex and I do so much together and in my opinion it's harder to make new friends when you're with someone you already know. It's too easy to just stick with each other instead of putting yourself out there.

One of my work friends, Jacob, has a friend Ellen who I met and got along with well, and she invited me to come to this meetup she does, an all girl hiking/ backpacking / outdoors adventure club. 

It sounded perfect for me, I love hiking and camping, the group sounds really fun and positive, and I've been missing having girl friends for a while.

So I made plans to go on a weekend camping and rafting trip with the group. We'd be camping out for two nights and spending a day hiking, and another day Whitewater rafting. The only person I will know is Ellen, and I hardly know her since we only meet twice. But she seems nice and she promised me that the group is really welcoming to newcomers.

I told Alex about how I was going camping with the group, and he didn't like how I was going to the woods for 2 days with a bunch of strangers and an acquaintance. Especially because there might not be cell reception. He wanted to come with me if I went.

I said that I probably couldn't bring him, it's a girl's group. Maybe if I was a member for a while and I found out that plus ones are ok occasionally, I could bring them. But I didn't want to be that girl who shows up for a girl's trip with her boyfriend in tow, and ruin the vibe. Especially not as my first impression.

So I said no, and we're kind of at a standstill. Alex thinks I'm being reckless, and I think the trip is worth going to, there's no way to make friends without putting yourself out there a little

I really liked him and we had our issues but I thought we could work them out. He broke up with me abruptly after going MIA for 3 days saying that he has other goals and being in a relationship takes time away from it. He also doesn't know how to manage it all. I believe him because he had a terrible sleeping schedule and would often crash and knock out for 10-12 hours on a couch accidentally. Adding to his ambitious nature, his extra-circular actives, work, extra courses and his family and friends, a girlfriend just wasn't something he could manage on top.

We have James, the forever eccentric guy, Connor, the good-looking guy, and Daniel, the tall and jolly guy. This is our freshmen year in an institute of higher education and i got along with them quite well for the majority of half the year. All of a sudden, during the June holidays, which is why Im posting this towards the end of the month to confirm my suspicions they're avoiding me, they just seem to have ghosted me completely. I asked if they wanted to hang out or study together as we usually did at out local hang-out spot but all I got in return was unread messages and the occasional blue ticks. 

Sometimes I like to think that perhaps they've forgotten about me to stop myself from thinking negatively about them but I knew something was not right. Lately, they have been hanging out with this girl, same age as all of us, let's call her Jane, who happens to be quite close to the 3 guys who i've listed above. By the way, these people, both the guys and the girl occupy a leadership position in our school, went to a leadership camp together, and possibly got closer. I, did not attend the camp as I had some family event to attend during the holidays and I always prioritised my family first before anything. Now that weeks have passed after the camp, they were studying at our hang-out spot, and if i ever get a message from them, they're telling me that there is no longer any space available for me to sit.

This has been on my mind for the past few weeks and has severly affected my mental state and my motivation to do any work. Never have i been left out this severely, which has got me thinking what have i done to them, sure, maybe I'm a bit boisterous at times here and there, but i have never went overboard with my behaviour as i know my boundaries. I thought about confronting them but i feel like that would make matters worse. There's the possibility of them taking it in a way which portrays them as the bad people, and I know they're nice people at heart, even though we've met for only 6 months, but at the same time, I have my doubts and I try to not let scepticism take the better of me.

I was two months pregnant when I found out my bf of 7 years had a secret kik account. I made a fake account and messaged him, wanting to make sure it was really was him. 

30 min of simple chatting before he sent a nude picture, which I never asked for. He is doing this while at work. 

Once he sent me the picture I stopped messaging him on the fake account. 

When he got home from work I asked him about kik and why he had an account on there. He became angry and said he did not. I told him I know he does and to please just tell the truth and he continued to tell me he didnt have a kik. 
I told him I was the one messaging him earlier that day and he didnt have much to say after that. 
He told me he was just under a lot of stress and I was the only one hes talked to on there and he had already felt guilty and deleted the app earlier after sending the picture. 

None of this I believe. One reason being that after he sent the picture and I didnt reply he messaged the account again asking if I liked the picture. Another reason being that I've had my suspicions of him having accounts on other sites before, such as tinder. 

Fast forward to now. Our son is now 2 months old and I cannot stop thinking about him cheating everyday. 
I even looked up ways to deal with it and one of the suggestions was to talk to him about it and ask him for the truth about everything he did. 

I think knowing the truth would help me start to move past this since I wont be wondering all day. 

Because of this I asked him one day if he could sign into his kik account and I could look at it. He refused. Told me he had forgotten the login information and told me he wasnt going to talk about it anymore. 

I doubt he forgot his login information because I went back to our messages and realized it tells you how long a person has been on kik. His account was made almost 4 years ago, in 2015. 

He refuses to talk about it but I can't stop thinking about how long he's been cheating, if anything has ever happened in person, etc.

964,HermesTr1smegistus,[new],10,c5ru77,2,"Okay so this girl and I have had a long history together, and quite a unique one, so please bear with me. 

&#x200B;

I met this girl at a con when I was 14 and she was 18, granted, a much more prohibitive age gap at the time, but I've had a crush on her on and off ever since. I've dated plenty of other girls in that time, and I've also been open to her about how I felt. In fact, its been a running joke between us, that we keep trying to seek each other when we're single, but whenever one of us is out of a relationship, the other one is in one.

&#x200B;

Despite all of that, we have amazing chemistry, mainly due to the fact that we share alot of personal interests and passions, and have stayed good friends ever since, occasionally jokingly flirting with one another here and there. Recently however, over the past 3 years or so, I've been a little out of luck. Due to a number of personal unforeseen factors, university life has treated me like shit, and as much as I'd like to have been more outgoing, I was mostly reclusive and as a result, single. However, having left university about 4 months ago after finishing my coursework early and thus leaving the negative experiences I've had there behind, I've happily began to open up more, work out, and generally enjoy life. 

&#x200B;

At the same time, while she was with a long time boyfriend at the time, I've noticed her giving me subtle hints. She's always going on about how much hotter I am since I started working out even getting kinda physical with me, touching me or feeling me up or stuff along those lines. She's also been gushing about me since I got my tattoo (since she really likes them) and admittedly, her boyfriend has been sorta slacking as well in the visual department. I remember when they first met, he was quite into fitness himself, but now he's got a beer gut the size of a cannonball. Besides that, he seems to have been somewhat neglectful of her for the past 6 months and as a result, I guess me and her grew ALOT more closer. She's been sharing all these details with me about how they used to have a good sex life and she wishes he had more diverse sexual interests like me, which she's also been very curious about. She's been telling me how if she wasn't with her current boyfriend at the time she'd love to be my girlfriend etc etc. Obviously, there's alot of things that I don't know about their relationship, but it seems that both of them have been growing distant from each other for quite a while now.

&#x200B;

And thus we reach the first time in our history of knowing each other where both me and her are single. Now, I know the girl in question is also a huge people pleaser, so I'm sort of worried that all the compliments she's paid me were just to make me feel better after the hell I've been through for the past 3 years. Essentially something along the lines of 'Im in a stable relationship, whats the harm in telling this poor soul I'd date him if I was single to help him rebuild his confidence?'

&#x200B;

Obviously, I don't feel entitled to her affections, that isnt the case at all, but at the same time, I'm worried that if I try to pursue something with her I'll just look like an idiot and worse case scenario it'll damage our friendship, which I still value anyway. This is probably a really immature thing to ask, but I've honestly been out of the game for MUCH longer than I would've liked to be, and I'm a little behind on things. Obviously the age is a factor, but I wouldn't take it into account too much, she's dated guys younger than her before, so let's not mull over that too much.

I have to beg him to get out of bed so we can do things like go to a pond, or grocery shopping, or just have a nice day together. Sometimes he?s great!

I met Abby on OKC 4 weeks ago or so. We chatted, switched to text, and then went on a date, which turned into more dates and eventually us deciding to date. It was a bit of a bad idea from the start, since she had just graduated and was applying to internships about 100 miles away, but I was really into her and was considering trying long distance if she had to leave.

I thought things were going really well, up until this Sunday. We were hanging out at her place, and she started making jokes about being out of my league and me being easy, which I shrugged off, partly because both of those felt true, if mean. After she joked about me being her rebound, though, I called her out on it, and that's where the wheels came off.

She admitted to only having messaged me in the first place because she thought I would be ""an easy get"", and that she had meant this to just be a fling before leaving. I asked her if she actually liked me at all, and she said she didn't know, I was cute and funny at times. I left that night hurt and confused. The next day, she texted me to confess that two or so weeks in she realized she had to come clean about why she messaged me, but didn't want to deal with the consequences. So instead, she did what any normal person would do and started insulting me to try to get me to realize she was bad for me. She admitted her behavior was manipulative and told me that I shouldn't take her back.

I'm not going to take her back - that ship sailed and sank like the Titanic. But I keep thinking ""why?"" Why suggest dating (she was the one to first float the idea when I asked her what she wanted) if she didn't like me? Why say things like ""you'll meet \[insert friend here\] if we continue dating""? Why did she talk to my housemates when she came over if she just wanted a fling? Hell, why not just be honest and tell me she wanted something quick and uninvested, instead of making me feel like an idiot calling us girlfriends?

I don't want answers to these questions from you all. My question is, should I just try to put it all out of mind? One part of me desperately wants to know all the answers, but the rest of me says that any answers I could even get from her or figure out myself are going to be wrong at best and outright based on lies at worst. Should I just content myself with ""I got used and treated bad and it doesn't matter the justifications she could have?""

As for him, he has been in and out of jobs due to many reasons for the past 6 years, hasn?t gotten a proper job that could last him more than 6 months. The last one was a real dealbreaker for him due to workplace bullying. I fully support his decision to leave because of workplace bullying. The previous ones however, were due to people issues which I felt could be resolved. 

He was out of job for the past a year and half.

So basically we?ve talked and I told him that he cannot keep going like this because if that?s the case, no job will ever fit your criteria and you?ll just end up quitting thinking that it would resolve the problem.

My father was always described as a kind, sincere, empathetic and genuine man. A bit shy. I don't disagree with them, but the man they know and the one I know are not the same.


Our relationship hasn't ever been more than him ordering me what to do and forcing me to enroll in classes and programs I never asked for. I was always to be available and willing to obey. No exceptions besides illness. All the activities he allowed were for my education, and further from that he didn't seem to care. It was hard for me to understand this, even now.


We barely touched ever, not to mention hugged or kissed, only when my mom forced us, maybe three times in my life. The most awkward memories of my life...

Truth is that, my father was someone who went through intense spiritual enlightenment and he sees things a lot differently than most people. He may had never showed or told me he loved me but how devoted he was to my education clearly is an indicator he did (even though my wishes were barely a concern to him).


He is 58 now, very frail and every little worry makes him very sick and paralized. When I came out to him as gay, he could barely think straight and spent much of the week paralyzed. How can a man that can yell like an ape for not doing my daily math crumble at the fact that I am sure I will marry a woman one day? And he wasn't disappointed just genuinely concerned. But he didn't show any emotion.


It is clear to me now that I'd be lucky if he bypassed year 70... And honestly I just wish I could hug him once. I always had to be tough and disciplined in his eyes and the more time passes the more I feel I would think I didn't do enough with him. I am a cold and calculated person with little patience and sympathy, unlike him, but very much like he treated me. At every tear he looks at me really strange like he wants to tell me to man up.

How do I make this a bit more enjoyable for the both of us until it's too late? In the end I really do want to think I did him right.

We've been dating a couple months now and all was going well at the beginning. We felt a real connection, we both said ""I love you"" to eachother within a couple days of going out. 

But a couple days ago, I was using her laptop and I saw something I wish I hadn't seen. She had her Facebook Messenger open in a separate tab and I didn't know what it was so I snooped without thinking. Revealing 2 different conversations, one with someone she renamed ""My World ??"" and another renamed ""My Everything"". Right after I had noticed them she walks in and I immediately close the tab with hesitation.

That's when it all kicked off when I questioned her about them, she tried saying they were both ex's and she just didn't delete the conversations whilst snatching the laptop from my hands making sure I wouldn't go back on there. She promised there was nothing going on and that she ""deeply loved me"" and ""wouldn't mess around with anyone else behind my back."". She says the last message was sent last year but these lt messages I think were from this year. These were sent 3 months into the relationship.

I have history with paranoia and anxiety so that's when stuff really hit me hard because I just didn't believe her, at all. 

I think I knew she was lying because of how the dates were presented on the side bar next to the conversations, they both said ""February 12"" and ""February 14"" on them which is really weird because we had been dating a couple months prior to that. She said they were from the year before, which would've been 2018 but the date format was wrong. It would've been 12/02/2018 and 14/02/2018 if it was last year but they weren't. I know this because I checked on my conversations from February 2018 on my Messenger. 

I just really need some advice because my paranoia and anxiety really mess with me sometimes, she knows I've had bad experiences in relationships in the past. When we're out in public, she wants to hold hands and most of the time we do hold but more recently I've been keeping to myself and she doesn't understand why because I won't tell her about what's bothering me.

Any advice to greatly appreciated.

We've been dating 4.5 years. We live together. We've had a mostly decent relationship, but recently rocky. He'd been acting weird for a few weeks in May then told me he ""thought"" he wanted to break up with me about \~1 month ago, then took it back the next day and asked to go to counseling. This was quite literally out of nowhere, we just moved to a new apartment together (from the old apartment we'd been living in together for almost 3 years.) Originally he said his reason was that he wasn't sure if he ever wanted a committed relationship, that it was all to do with him and his confusion about his place in the world and not about me. Since then, he's acted like that never happened. I asked him about it this past weekend and he said he knows he can't pretend it never happened, and that maybe we should still do counseling, but he wants to be with me still.

He didn't go out much in May. The ""acting weird"" was him being on his computer playing video games more and not interacting with me.

In the past couple weeks he has gone out more with friends, never out too late and always lets me know he is on his way back at a fairly reasonable time. I've also been away memorial day and another weekend after that.

Yesterday I got a notice that we were at 50% of our data allowance (we share a phone plan) and....I got tempted. Previously he had barely used data (like <500 MB per month) so I snooped. I accidentally saw that he had sent 300+ texts this month compared to my 30. After that I took it another step too far?I went to the call/chat logs and he has been texting the same number 1 state away (we live in a very large city/don't have cars - the state is somewhat accessible by public transit, but the area the number is from is remote almost every single day since June 8th. The first texts on the 8th were sent while I was out of the apartment one morning. They text again the following day in the morning. He went out to hang out with a friend of his who I know and didn't text the number while he was out. He texts the number again 3 days later and it's more consistent after that.

There is a single call made, Saturday night while I was away on the 15th, for 2 minutes, preceded by a couple texts. The ""destination"" on the log shows the call as having come from the next state over, but I don't know if that means he made the call while in another state or the other person in another state called him. He had been answering texts from me around the time of the call, but didn't answer texts I sent him 2 hours later until the following day. He didn't text that number again until the following afternoon. The following Monday (I got back Sunday), he spent the night in our guest room hanging out on his computer (door was open but I didn't see what he was doing.) He texted that number nonstop from 8pm-11pm while he was in there.

There's no clear pattern since then that makes me think he was out with this person last week instead of his friends (that is, he texts the number intermittently while he said he was out.) It's possible some of the gaps in texting would be them meeting up. I have no idea. He's just been texting them every single day, whenever I'm not in the room or whenever he is at work. Yesterday we were hanging out all night and he was showing me texts from his friends, but whenever he walked away the text log shows he was contacting that other number. This morning we took the train together to work....2 minutes after I got off, I texted him about something. He didn't reply for 15 minutes, but the text log shows he texted the other number as I was walking off the train, while I was texting him (responding to the messages they sent before we went to bed.)

There's no concrete history of infidelity, but there have always been trust issues in our relationship. He once lied to me about quitting his job so I know he is capable of lying (he admitted to it 2 days later and said he lied because he was embarrassed about not having a job.)

He used to be bad about communication, and I would freak out about it (first 1-2 years of the relationship.) Sometimes there wasn't anything to worry about, but sometimes he would go out with someone I was jealous of without saying anything until afterwards. I've never had evidence that he outright lied about where he went, though. 2.5 years ago, a friend said she saw his Bumble profile while I was traveling for a week. At the time, he was using a shitty phone that could barely run apps. He said he didn't realize it, that he must have never signed out of the app (and had used it for Bumble BFF as I had) and that if I wanted he would show me his phone. I stupidly said I trusted him.

He would often question what I was doing too as though I was lying. He asked me to stop hanging out with one of my male friends a year ago because we were getting dinners alone and he was jealous. After that, he questioned me every time I had plans at night for a few weeks.

I don't know what I'm even trying to convince myself of at this point. Even if he isn't cheating, even if there's an explanation for this, I feel like our relationship is done right? I can't even ask him what this is all about because he's hid it so well in person (I think he might even have their text thread muted so notifications don't show up on the lock screen?) that the only way I can admit to knowing about it is by telling him I checked the call logs.

TL;DR: I snooped and found out my boyfriend has been texting a new number frequently in the past 2 weeks. He hides it well and I only found out because we share a phone plan. He also said he thought he wanted to break up with me 1 month ago before quickly taking it back.

Even for completely normal things that all kids do.

I was honestly pretty easy to handle, but through the years she undermined my self confidence, often told me everything that?s ?wrong? with me and that I?m basically a shitty, weird person.

When my father died, in a weird way it pushed us closer together, since she then started treating me more like an adult, and relying on me for company. She was still negative and angry tho.

Since I became an adult, it?s been a slow war but I managed to become independent and not allow her to meddle with my life anymore, though she never stopped trying and never will. Our relationship for a while was mostly ok, and we were on ?friendly? terms for 90% of the year. HOWEVER there are still instances where she will insult and nag me. Last time she visited me she became incredibly shitty and basically told me a few extremely things she thinks about me. She?s now trying to play it off as ?I was just frustrated? but I cannot forget what she said, nor do I want to.

The thing is that I feel like I suffer either way. If I have her in my life, I?m more stressed and anxious. If I have no contact with her for a while I feel free, but sad. I still think about her often and she sends me messages and though I never reply it feels like either way, she?ll always occupy my mind somehow no matter what I do.

Current Situation:

I am going into my 4th year of university. It's summer break and I am currently working as an intern. I've been living with my parents while I work. During the school year, I live alone because of how far school is from home.

I am currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (20F). We've been dating for about a year now. However the issue arises with my parents. They disapprove of her because of her socioeconomic status and difference of upbringing. My family would be classified as upper-middle while her's would be classified as lower. She also comes from a family with an abusive father. They feel like this difference will affect my relationship with her in the long term. I agree it could happen. So far no big issues. Regardless, I think it's up to my discretion to continue dating or break up.

Also I should mention, My girlfriend is moving back to her home country in about a week. She will be there temporarily but the duration is unknown yet. The earliest I would see here is after my graduation. We've talked and decided we would like to continue dating and make long distance work.

&#x200B;

Main Issue:

Often times I feel like my parents cross the line between being good/caring parents and overbearing/no boundaries parents, especially when it comes to my romantic relationships. It's not only affecting me, but often time the romantic relationships and my SO.

&#x200B;

Example Scenarios:

\- My parents get upset I come home late from dates with my girlfriend. Dates happen about 3-4 times a week. I usually see her right after work (so about 6) and I get home any time between 11:00pm - 1:00 am. Is this something myparents should be upset about?

\- My girlfriend and I would like to spend a weekend before she goes away. My parents are saying no. Do I even need their permission?

\- My parents have tried to talk me into breaking up with her by saying things like: ""Oh she's too different, life will be hard with her"", ""There are so many more fish in the sea"", ""You could do better"". Things like that.

979,odelaros,[new],20,c5reya,0,"I had met my girlfriends parents a few weeks ago and we both were eager for her to meet mine. After work, I picked her up and as I pulled into the drive way, I started to feel an enormous amount of stress and nerves hit me all at once. I felt suffocated and my head was heavy. As I saw my girlfriend, she was wearing a dress and the length of it bothered me and that added to the emotions I was feeling. I had thoughts running through my head of how this meeting would go, if my parents would get along with her, what would we talk about etc. My girlfriend gets in the care and we start driving, we're having conversation but my responses were short. I felt these feelings overwhelming me and taking over which I did not know how to communicate them to her.

We arrive at the restaurant, my parents show up a little after me and I didn't even get up to introduce them to her. I froze, my girlfriend was doing the majority of the talking as I sat there, feeling helpless and not knowing what to say or how to make conversation as if i had never been to a dinner party before. A little background on my parents, they're Hispanic but their English is good. We usually converse in Spanish so navigating in English felt foreign to me. I didn't know how to do it. So we make it through dinner and they really hit it off, she is only the second person I have ever introduce to them which also added to my nerves. We leave and I'm not responsive, I usually hold her hand and we chat and are lovey to one another, always smiling but not this time. I had barely looked at her or smiled.

Fast forward to the end of the evening and I'm finally feeling a bit of relief but it was too late, I had been too cold the entire evening which brought confusion to her, she had thought she did something to upset me. On the drive to drop her off, I tried talking to her and expressing how I felt during the moment but she was already in her own mind at that point. I brought up the dress (which I know I shouldn't, as soon as it left my mouth, I knew I had screwed myself) and there was silence the rest of the ride. I had never seen her this upset, it was our first real argument and fight. I drop her off and my mind is racing. I don't text to give her space cause I know she needed time to process everything so I get home and discuss with my parents of what happened at dinner.

About half an hour after I dropped her off, I get a text telling me how humiliated and embarrassed she felt. She believes my parents think I don't like her and that I'm not fully committed to our relationship. At this point, I feel horrible and try to reiterate what I felt but it was too late. All my girlfriend could think about was that I brought up the dress. I knew that I had messed up and apologized and acknowledged my actions were uncalled for. Especially after she welcomed me into her home with open arms when I met her parents. I feel devastated and just don't know what to do. I wasn't able to be there for her how she wanted me and it is killing me. I love her so much and fear that my mistake will throw all of it away.


tl;dr: I was cold and unresponsive to my girlfriend and was not there for her. I made her feel like she was alone during the evening. I know I need to give her space. At the same time I'm fearing that this will be our breaking point and she will not want to continue our relationship and work on it. I know it only takes one bad time to oversee all the good times we've had. I'm stressing and just anticipating her response. I wish I could speak to her in person but with our schedules it makes it difficult.

980,sabrinathewitch2511,Non-Romantic,8,c5revv,2,"  I've been friends with this girl for over 10 years. From elementary school, to high school, and now as roommates at university, we have been best friends for as long as I can remember. But lately, I cannot help but notice that she gets very jealous of me, or maybe just does not like me anymore. Whatever it is, I can barely speak to my best friend anymore without getting frustrated and insecure, and I really need help on what to do.

It started when we got to university. We are in the same program, so she would constantly be asking my marks and, when she could, would try to one-up me, telling me how much better she did. She would also beg me to not study or do work if I was doing better than her in a course, saying ""you're already doing better than me, why do you need to study?"". I also have a pretty interesting research job in the city, and she does not want to hear anything about it. If I try to tell her a funny story from work, she'll immediately change the subject. She does not want to hear about my plans for the future, after graduation, saying it ""stresses her out that I know what I want to do"". When I would come home from the gym, she'd ask me what exercises I did and would then proceed to tell me how she ran more, lifted heavier, or did more reps. I am constantly complimenting her clothes, hair, makeup, etc.; you know, just small things that girl best friends say to each other to lift each other up. She probably has not complimented me or given me anything but a side-look when I walk in the door for over a year. I truly feel like I'm being judged whenever I speak. 

I know these things may seem small, but I truly do not recognize my best friend anymore. Its gotten to the point where we cannot have a normal conversation without her proving her jealousy/insecurity in some way. It is really exhausting to feel like you are constantly competing or being observed by someone who is supposed to always be there for you. Has anyone had any similar experience, and know what I should do?

981,shinyfreckles,Breakups,2,c5rej3,1,"I'm 19 and I've moved around a lot in my life. I don't really have a best friend that I could go to right away if I had a problem, or someone to constantly keep in contact with. This is mostly because of the move. I had a bunch of close friends in my old country, but it's hard to be invested in each other's lives if you're so far apart. I also have friends from college now, but they have their own best friends that they've grown up with. It's also hard to hang out with them often because we live very far apart from each other and traffic is horrible in the city.

I was with my S/O for almost two years when I broke things off with him. He turned into a different person in the last few months of our relationship (cheating, lying) and I've cut him out of my life. He used to be my best friend, someone I could tell my insecurities and shameful  secrets to. He was the person I'd tell the most useless shit to, but I still did because he cared. He would always ask how my day was and care about everything big I do (like going overseas or a final project).

I don't want him back because I know nothing good will come from it. But I feel really sad that I lost a best friend. Nobody cared about me as much as he did and now I  don't have someone to talk to all the time. 

It also hurts that he doesn't seem as hurt about the relationship ending, even though I'm the one who proposed breaking it off in the first place. The same person who would do the sweetest things is now telling his friends ""that's why I broke up with her"" when I was bugging him to return my stuff.

I know I still have friends who deeply care about me, but losing someone that I was so invested in, and was so invested in me really hurts. Realistically, I think that I don't need someone to always talk to or always check up on me or always ask about my day. Please help me look on the bright side.

982,kendraduchamp,Relationships,16,c5rcgy,2,"There?s this guy (M,21) that I?ve worked with since March of this year. 

Not too long ago, I (F, 18) told him I was attracted to him, and he basically said that wasn?t his intention with me. I was totally fine with that, and instead we became really close friends. Our friendship is really playful, which before I guessed I was mistaking for flirty ness. 

The other night, went out to the movies together and got really drunk. We came back to my apartment and he asked if he could stay over, and if he could sleep with me in my bed. And i guessed if we were just friends, it was fine. That it wouldn?t be weird. 

He stripped down into only his boxers, and started to cuddle with me. I tried to convince myself our actions were totally platonic. He started to pet my back, and then he pulled up my shirt, and took off my bra and continued to pet my back,  I did the same to his, he held me from behind for a long time, and would caress my hands, arms, thighs and ass. And it didn?t feel weird. It felt totally and completely loving and genuine. And there were some points where things were almost sexual. Like he got on top of me and started tickling me and grabbing my hips. And tried to hold my boobs like his hands were my bra, as a joke? I enticed him back, even getting on top of him at one point.

We fell asleep holding hands and kind of playing with each others fingers. Everything was just really intimate in a way you?d see lovers treat each other in some romance movie. I?ve never really been with anyone like that before.
It felt good too because he made me feel so comfortable about my body. I wasn?t ashamed about my figure at all, because he was just being so loving with me. 

We didn?t have sex. And I think it was partly because I kept some boundaries.

In the morning I was scared to show him I was awake, thinking he would tell me he regretted it, that we were both drunk and not thinking right. But he didn?t. 

We went out and walked around the city, and ate breakfast and even talked about some of the things we talked about when we were in bed. Making it clear that he remembered what happened, but never mentioning the intimate parts. I decided I was just gonna let this go. If he wants something with me he?ll need to say something because I already have. 

He did say at one point that he ?didn?t want to make things complicated.? So I guess that means that he doesn?t think of our relationship as sexual or romantic? 

I?m just confused because I totally thought we would just be friends and that would be fine. But then that happened. And I?ve never really been that intimate like that with someone who was ?a friend.? And it?s hard for me to be like ?Oh yeah that?s just something friends do.?

TL;DR : A close friend of mine and I spent a drunk night together cuddling and being very intimate with each other.

983,Friendstr,Relationships,6,c5r8qf,2,"Some background, me and my gf met 2.5 years ago and got along right away.  We started out as really good friends and it progressed in to a relationship 15 months later.  I?m used to more toxic relationships and she is far from it.  We have very good chemistry.  She is very mature and values communication as do I, yet we rarely argue and things have gone smoothly.  The only issue is that I live 4 hours away and we can?t see each other as often as we?d like.  We?ve both had mostly crappy relationships and this is marriage material.  

Throughout our relationship, I?ve never really felt insecure about us, she?s been very affectionate and present and looking towards the future.  This is not something I?m used to in a relationship. In the past month or so she changed jobs and things started to change.  She works later than before.  She finishes work at 10 and is sleeping by midnight so we don?t have as much time to talk each night. She used to finish work around 4-5 and had time to unwind and then talk to me.  Now she hardly has any time to unwind and is tired anyway so our convos aren?t as long.

The past ten days I?ve noticed a shift in her behavior.  She used to say very affectionate and flirtatious things to me, and that has stopped.  It?s felt like a friendship almost.  This is the first time since we?ve started dating that I?ve felt insecure about things, and lonely.  I?ve felt single almost.  The frequency of our communication isn?t too different, just the tone.  She hasn?t said she?s missed me like she used to do all the time. She hasn?t said anything remotely sexual and when I hint at it she avoids it. 

 She has a guy friend (that she met on Tinder before we met) who she hung out with two nights ago, they went to dinner, a sporting event, and then a bar afterwards.  She had hung out with him a couple of times before in the past year and it was no big deal, but this was the first time she explicitly asked me if it was okay, which I thought was odd since she didn?t ask me for permission to hang out with him before, and the first time she actually went out and spent an evening with a guy instead of just hanging out at their house nonchalantly.  It bothered me, I didn?t realize they were going out to dinner and a bar, I just thought they were going to just a sporting event.  Inappropriate or fine?

I told her that things have felt distant recently and she said she did feel distant because of her new schedule and everything and insisted it had nothing to do with our relationship specifically.  Also, the distance (living in another state) is hard on her too.  I?m not so sure what to think.  Part of me feels like maybe she?s on the way out and there?s more to the story here.  I don?t see myself cooling off just because my work hours changed and I have less time to communicate (even though that sucks).  Maybe it?s just a blip in the road since it?s only been a little over a week since I?ve really started noticing a change and that?s a small sample size.  I am more sensitive of a person and I pick up subtle things, maybe I?m looking too much in to it.  What do you guys think?

985,throwawayacc18666,[new],1,c5r56p,1,"What is her problem? Why is that happening?  
Hello! First of all, English is not my first language.  
It might be quite long.  
We?ve been with this girl (let?s call her Jenny) for the past 7 months and she moved in to my place about 3 months ago. I?m 24 years old, she is 23 years old.  
What should be noted is that she?s been seeing a psychotherapist for the past two years because of depression, social anxiety etc. and from what she tells me it?s much better since her first visit. Her father is an alcoholic and has been since she was a child, her mother is rather a simple woman. After years of struggling, she convinced her father to go to an AA meeting. From what I know he attends meetings but he still drinks (I was a witness of this act a few times since). Generally Jenny dislikes her mother a lot (it probably started since her mother could not understand what depression is and why Jenny spent whole days in bed - again her mother is a simple woman) but likes her father (I personally hate alcoholic behavior but never made a comment about it to her). Her parents dislike each other and they probably don?t really talk more that it?s needed.  
Besides that Jenny also has some blood circulation issues and it also started about two years ago. Generally she hates walking anywhere (which I love) mostly because when she reaches like 1 kilometer she already has to stop for a while and after that she stops after 500m and later even after every 100m and she describes this feeling as ?tearing her legs?. Her humor is often also the state of our relationship. If her legs hurt it?s going to be a bad day for us.

I don?t want to bore you so I?ll just give you specifics.

Whenever we have an argument I try to be as calm as I can be. I believe everything can be talked about and we can resume our normal life. It isn?t the case here. If there?s any problem and I want to talk about it, she either leaves the room without a word or is very passive-aggressive. If I don?t give up and continue trying to talk about the problem, she will cry or shout or both. She then tells me how unhappy she is with me. I try to calm her down and tell that I only want to talk about the problem.

She is often very rude towards me (especially if she?s tired or had a tough day at work). The best example I can think of is this situation:  
I tend to speak to people using their first names (very often) so whenever I wrote to her I wrote it in the following manner: ?Jenny, what would you like for dinner today?? or ?Jenny, what time do you finish work today?? and recently she got mad about it. Like seriously she was mildly furious. I drove for her after she finished and confronted her about it. I like to have things settled and talked about. She was furious that I even mention it, talked something and I said that this is the way I address people and I don?t see any reason to change it. Her response was ?So maybe you should consider if you?re ready to be in a relationship?. We were already driving home and I said ?You?re telling me that maybe I?m not ready to be in a relationship because I address you by your name and you?re impolite towards me whenever you have a bad day or you?re tired.? She had no answer for me so I continued with ?Can you see your hypocrisy?? to which she cried ?Maybe I can?t fucking see it?. I was shocked. She also told me that ?maybe you should accept me as I am? and I asked if she would accept my rudeness whenever I was tired or had a bad day and she responded that she wouldn?t. So I asked why then she wants me to accept such behavior and her reply with an aggressive voice - ?Maybe I do it fucking unconsciously?. No sorry from her. Really.  
Later at home I asked her if she calmed down and I hoped she thought a bit about her behavior and she only started sobbing and said how unhappy she was with me.

I asked her why she behaves like that. She said her parents always argued and never talked to each other. I said ?So you saw this situation at home and you hated it. Why do you repeat it in our relationship?? She said ?I can?t really change it that easily? and I said ?Do you not have free will? Does someone perform actions for you?? to which she replied ?I cannot answer you this question?.  
She then went home for the weekend and when she returned she was very nice to me and wanted to be together. Again no words that she was sorry. She told me that ?it was also my fault? and that ?I see myself as flawless?. I forgave her, I don?t keep grudge for too long.

It was okay for like two weeks and last Saturday similar things happened. She can never say ?sorry?. At least through her tears she admitted that I was right and the problem is in her.  
After most arguments she tells me that she?ll move out from me as soon as possible. I don?t care any longer.  
Once she also told me that she?s afraid I?d throw her out if we argue. I told her a million times that it?s not gonna happen and I?m not like that. If we break up (or already did it) I?ll give her a lot of time to find a place and can even help her move her stuff.

I often take her to various places for dates or we spend a lot of free time together watching movies or (to an extents) walks.  
Oh and she doesn?t like to talk a lot (even with me) because ?she has to talk all day in her job with people and when she gets home, she wants some quiet time? and I have a problem with that - I love to talk to people.  
Yet I know that even when can?t say she?s sorry, she knows she fucked up because she?d eventually write to me, come to me etc.  
She is almost always tired. Many times she finishes her job, gets home, eats something, maybe we watch some episode and she goes straight to bed to wake up the next day.

Maybe I should also note that I hate her emotional eating. She isn?t fat (normal BMI) but she is quite chubby around her belly and constantly eats sweets. When I met her, I was shocked when she ate a whole bar of chocolate in three minutes. I kept saying that I didn?t like her eating habits (sweets every day, additionally cakes on the weekends?). After my nth attempt of saying her that she started crying like it?s not my business what she eats and she?ll do whatever she wants. True. I just don?t like it.  
I would like to ask you what do you think about this behavior? Do you think that apart from these past depression and anxiety issues there might be something more?

For the first six months, my GF and I did it twice a week consistently, so there weren't too many issues there. However, in the past 6 months things have dwindled to only once a week (nowadays twice a week is a busy week for us). I've started to get really sexually frustrated lately, and have brought it up with her how I'm feeling unsatisfied and undesirable due to our sex life. These talks (unsurprisingly) didn't make any difference, and things are still the way they are. 

What makes things worse is that we see each other 3-4 times a week, and she wants to cuddle a lot, so it's INCREDIBLY sexually frustrating for me. Weeknights are completely out of the picture because she always falls asleep by 10pm, so the only time we really ever have sex is Saturday mornings. So there's no excitement at all, only routine. 

It's not like I'm not pulling my weight either -- I take her on dates very often, am overall a caring boyfriend, I'm in great shape thanks to working out 5x a week, and I take good care of myself. I feel like I've done EVERYTHING in my power to help improve things, but nothing seems to work. 

My GF has started noticing that I've become distant. She's often asking me if there's anything wrong, why I don't want to cuddle as much, etc which is funny because SHE SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER! I've told her so many times how I need sex more than once a week to be happy, yet it feels like she just buries her head in the sand and ignores the elephant in the room. 

Honestly don't know what to do at this point, I feel like I'm going to end up getting too fed up and break it off eventually.

We met a few months before then (both in college), ""talked"" or whatever you want to call it for 3 or so months and then started dating. Everything has gone really well. We get along, she treats me great, I really do love her. At about at the 3 month point, the school year ended. I had an internship lined for the summer about 8 hours away from where she would be. I was nervous that she wouldn't want to stay together, but she assured me that we were going to be fine, and we had visits planned. I've seen her twice since the school year ended, and it hasn't been easy but we've tried to make the distance work as best as possible (phone calls, facetime, etc.). We had another visit planned upcoming in a few weeks, but pretty much out of the blue the other day she told me she wasn't happy with how things are going and she doesn't feel like the relationship is progressing due to us not seeing each other. She told me she thinks its best if we don't talk right now and take a break. I told her over and over we have made it a long time without seeing each other and we don't have that much longer to go. She said that ""something is missing"" and doesn't know if its the distance or something else, and we won't know until we are back in the same city fulltime again.

I don't want to kid myself. Is this over? I don't think I should wait around for someone who doesn't feel the same way about me as I feel about  them. I almost feel like the distance is an excuse, idk. I'm just devastated. I want to reach out to her so bad, but I don't think I should contact her until she contacts me first.

990,_tanner999_,Relationships,14,c5qvrv,2,"So this is a longer post that requires some back story. My girlfriend and I met on Bumble, which is not too terribly unusual in a college relationship. We both come from battered past relationships. Her last long-term relationship was relatively hard for her, as was mine, but we have both been in love before. We each coincidentally took about the same time off from dating (\~1.5 years) to correct ourselves and look at our own mistakes that we made in our past relationships. 

&#x200B;

On our first date (we had never met, but I had briefly seen her on campus once) it felt as if we had been catching up after being apart for a long time. We talked at a coffee shop in Dallas for 5 hours. Turns out we have the same ethical and political beliefs, and while our religious beliefs are different, we are both open minded and accepting, and it doesn't bother us at all. We started dating on our after our 3rd date.

&#x200B;

We have the same stance on relationships and have talked for hours about how we wont be a modern-day couple that gives just to receive something in return. She's done extremely nice things for me in return for essentially nothing (i.e. making a 6 hour drive just to return a car to my mom \[long story\]) and I have done stuff to the same degree. It has never been for the benefit of ourselves. Our views are perfectly aligned on what we want from a relationship.

&#x200B;

We also have always been extremely open and had full communication from day 1. I know her past sexual partners, her kinks, her emotional triggers, how to help calm her down, what frustrates her, you name it. Vice versa. We talk about any issues that arise, and about our own character flaws and what we've fixed about ourselves. We're aware of each other's seemingly gross habits and bathroom trips. There has genuinely been nothing that we haven't talked about, though we still learn more about each other everyday and teach each other lessons. She comes from a very wealthy family, while mine is very poor, so we have contending perspectives all the time. 

&#x200B;

We have plans in place for various issues that could arise, (pregnancy plan, argument mitigation, college graduation plans, etc.) you name it. Not to mention we are extremely supportive of each other in every endeavor. 

&#x200B;

I know about the honeymoon phase, but I haven't felt this mature and secure in a relationship ever, and that's including my ex whom I dated for almost 3 years, and I thought that was serious. To me, at least, it seems as if we have been dating for much longer than we have (only 3 months) and I was wondering what I should make of this. Is it moving too fast? Granted it doesn't feel too fast at all, and we are still head over heels in love with each other and things are still so exciting and it's honestly quite amazing and refreshing and comfortable to feel so secure.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months, and things are pretty much flawless and feel very secure, yet we've completely let ourselves go around each other in terms of physically, emotionally, and conversationally. are we moving too fast, or did we skip the honeymoon phase?",1561561342.0,"Is it normal to not go through a honeymoon phase, but to instead skip straight to a real relationship?

991,TerraNikata,Non-Romantic,4,c5qua5,0,"tl;dr: Roommate invited coworker who is quite awful to our vacation. I?m realizing this conversation is an eyeopener to worse behavior I didn?t want to acknowledge. 


Hey y?all. Writing this out just to clear the space in my head and figure out the right steps to take from here. Just to warn, it?s a lot, and if anything is unclear, let me know. 

My roommate, who we shall call Carl, kinda overstepped a boundary, and I feel that because of his actions since we moved in in March, I reacted with a lot more vitriol than I expected to have.


A band I love has a show in my hometown in August. My roommates and I love this band. So, we were going to plan a roommate weekend getaway to see the band and enjoy the beach there. I?ve been planning everything because I still have connections who can help us get cheap rooms. Yesterday, Carl told me that he invited a coworker of his to stay with us because ?she introduced me to the band, so it?s only right.? 


That angered me because this girl has body shamed me in front of guests at a house party a few months ago, as well as disrespected my home by going into my other roommates room and going through his stuff. Roommate didn?t have curtains yet so we saw her doing it right through the window. Carl defends her actions that night because he claimed she was very drunk on wine and that she?s a blunt person because she?s from the MidWest(sure, Jan). 


When I tried to explain this to him, he tried to bring up how I invited people over and didn?t let them know. That threw me for a loop because Carl apparently had an issue with that fact that my friend came over three months ago because friend got dumpedand I was in the neighborhood. I mentioned it to my roommates via WhatsApp, who were concerned and supportive of him staying until he calmed down. I didn?t realize Carl had a problem with it because he never brought it up until now.


I?ve known Carl for three years, but this behavior has only started since we moved in. While the whole ?inviting his bully of a coworker thing? has become the reason why I am posting, his behavior has also been plaguing my roommates and I. Carl has become very passive aggressive, bitter, and just very angry. He won?t communicate what upsets him until someone calls him out on his behavior, which he will use to deflect anger off of him. He complains about how he is single but will come up with excuses for why every girl he meets on dating apps and IRL are not good enough. The dating thing has been a sore spot since he broke up with his girlfriend two years ago, but honestly she was so mean and demanding of his time our entire friend group was relieved. 

It?s dampening the environment of the apartment and the idea that he could just invite someone who disrespected us in our very home hurts. I don?t know what has happened to my friend. My roommates and I walk on eggshells around him and it?s even leading to my other roommate, a fairly levelheaded individual, to start experiencing anxiety.

992,kjm1036,[new],16,c5qpx3,0,"I?ve been suspecting that one of my best friends for years (22) F has a drinking issue and it has become more obvious the past few weeks. I have been on holiday with my friend for the past month in Europe and every time we go out to bars and clubs she almost blacks out every time. It?s just us two on holiday, however as someone who doesn?t drink much at all I have to babysit her every time we are out. When she drinks she doesn?t know when to stop although she claims she knows what she?s doing. She will average 6 men a night that she?ll hook up with at the club, about 10-12 drinks over a few hours (hard to calculate with pitchers) and she puts herself into danger by climbing on surfaces and falling over all the time. 

For instance last night it took me 3 hours to have her go back to the hotel so we can sleep. I had to tell bartenders not to pour her anymore drinks as people were staring at her embarrassing herself. When I told her we have to go because it was very late in the morning and we are in a foreign country with phones that don?t work (Damn SIM cards) she says ?you can go home, I?ll stay here, I?m not done having fun?. Despite grabbing her arm she would say ?f*** off I?m having fun? while I stand by myself in the club borderline anxiety attack as she is doing much more than kissing in the corner of the club. Eventually she came back to the hotel with the man she was with because I asked if he wanted to go back with her. The receptionist kicked both of them out for drunkenness and no guest policy while I was getting ready for bed upstairs. One panic attack later, her location noted that she was across the island at this man?s hotel. 

My friends outside of my friend group ask me how we are even friends to begin with. We?ve known each other since we were 4 yrs old. She?s very much about partying and her image on social media while I like to stay in with my boyfriend or watch movies, wine nights with my other friends. My bf and friends believe our friendship is becoming toxic and actually dangerous because she is inconsiderate of my feelings. She does only care about herself. I just find it so scary because we aren?t even in our home country. 

My worry is that I am not doing enough as a friend to help her in the clubs and bars when she is plastered. No matter what I do to help she screams at me and condones me the next day when she?s sober saying to not tell her when to do when she drinks. This makes me upset as she always puts the both of us in danger. I can?t even describe how scary our walk home was last night. Being approached my strangers and her wanting to make out with random men as we pass them on the street. No matter what I say she turns the conversation around and points to my insecurities saying things like ?oh you?re ruining my fun bc you don?t drink? or ?you should break up with your bf and learn to have fun. What should I do?

993,breatheart,[new],4,c5qk4l,1,"We started joking about fighting whenever we disagreed like ""hey want to fight about this?"" We might have had 2 larger disputes before, but it was never more than one conversation and when we were done talking both of us never really defended ourselves again. If we ever talk about it again we say things like ""that situation sucked"" and don't rehash anything. Even those 2 times it was because of other people. First time was my friend said a bunch of rude stuff to him and acted poorly while drunk and he said how she wasn't a good friend (turns out he was right). The second time it was because I felt like his ex was trying to get back together with him and it was making me feel insecure because he was complacent (I was right but they work together so it's complicated but overall resolved). 

I don't like arguing, in fact I think it's awesome that we haven't really fought in over a year. But I am moving 1,000 miles away and we are discussing moving to be together in the future when the time is right and now it's starting to worry me. For the time being we aren't going to do long distance because he has to finish school (graduates December) and I have to adjust to a new city and we don't want to make any false promises if our lives continue to diverge. I've just read a million articles about arguing and when to know it's the right time to move for a relationship. The biggest red flag is that we haven't argued yet and so if we move and then can't overcome an argument it could just end things. I want to be with him and I'm certain if we both put in the effort and decide to move to be with each other, we will be together until we are old. At the same time, I also keep doubting myself because it's too perfect and healthy of a relationship.

We slept in a room together and so we get to know each other.
She has some really big issues (so do I), but I like those kind of girls.
She had a boyfriend at this time. We grow close. I think we fell in love(maybe I don't know) and we keep texting and visiting each other for some times. (We lived 500km apart)
I were there for her when she needed me.
We began sexting, despite she had a boyfriend. She felt awful after that.
At that time we said the L-word to one another. I was happy. But then she said it couldn't go on like this because of her boyfriend. I nearly broke in this Rollercoaster of emotion. 
But somehow we managed to stay friends.
Several Rollercoaster later she finally broke up with him. And I thought my time has come.
She want to study medicine. So I convinced her to move to my town where she can study and move together. 
She was very happy and so. And yea she visited me last month. So I can show her her new town. And we finally spent a night together. (we cuddled multiple times before tho). And Yea she took my virginity too???.
But Yea she told me that she didn't felt anything as we kissed. And long ago as we told us that we love each other (she had her boyfriend at this time) she told me that this was not exactly a lie but she tried to love me and be perfect for me (she was and still is).
And I still love her. But I too felt nothing much as we did it.
No firework. No nothing.

I've hence set the pattern of isolating from others. People in my class tend to sit away from me. I later regret doing that and I tried to bridge the pattern but I don't seem to have any chemistry with them and can't move past small talk.

I will soon begin a new internship and I really want to bridge this gap and make new friends. How can I do that? When I approach others, I tend to feel very awkward and stressed as I already feel like they labelled me as weird.

I was very insecure, had low self-confidence, and anxiety that would make me think the worst. I wasn't a crazy girlfriend, but I was still overly possessive and jealous. He has anger issues, and when my issues would get triggered, it would trigger his. I don't blame him, no one likes being assumed they're being unfaithful.


We broke up beginning of April. We sat down to discuss moving in together, and that became an argument that was the last straw. He broke up with me. Things hadn't been going very well, and I think the added stress/pressure from moving day coming up pushed him to it.

In the last 3 months, I've worked on myself. I started working out and got in great shape, picked up hobbies, even hung out with new people and doing new things. I will admit, part of that was to become a better person in hopes of us getting back together. I was also hoping he would reach out in that time, which he has not. 

We have a few mutual friends, and most of them say they have seen a huge improvement on my composure, attitude and overall well being. They also say that he seems to be just distracting himself, basically he seems miserable. I feel like he's waiting for me to reach out to him. This isn't the first time we broke up, and the other couple times I was the one who reached out to him. I think he's waiting for that again.

I just don't know what to do. People tell me I should wait for him to make a first move, since he was the one who broke up with me. But given our history, I feel like he's waiting for me. I've gone on a couple dates, trying to ""move on"", but I just keep thinking of him.

**Context:** 

We have been together for 2.5 years. The first 1\~1.5 years of our relationship were awesome, and we were both very happy. After that happy period I started struggling financially (debt) and I've been experiencing alot of stress from that. I handled the situation poorly and tried to ignore my debt. This resulted in me becoming more and more distant. My girlfriend noticed this, obviously, and tried to help me handle the situation. I ignored the help. I did not tell any of my friends or family about my problems, mainly out of embarrasment and partly because I did not want to confront the debt, because I saw no way out. This frustrated her because she felt like I needed to discuss this with my mother to get to a solution. This has been going on for the past year. During this time we saw each other less and less frequently because I refused to. I was afraid to meet up with her because I did not want the financial situation to be brought up. We still saw each other a few times a week though. 

&#x200B;

Looking back I was feeling more miserable by the week and this resulted in several things, all of which had a negative impact on our relationship. For example: I started eating really unhealthy and didn't take care of myself. I stopped working out completely because I couldn't get out of the house and my motivation was gone. As a result of this I gained alot of weight (70 -> 90 kg).  She didn't really care about me gaining weight but it made me feel really bad about myself and therefore I felt less desire to have sex with her. Our sex life before this was good. She took this the wrong way and felt like I wasn't attracted to her anymore and this harshly affected her confidence. I've tried to convince her that it had nothing to do with her, I do find her very attractive, but my libido just disappeared. I promised to work on my self-image by working out again and eating healthy but I didn't.

&#x200B;

There were a lot of other things that were going increasingly worse, but it all came down to me becoming more distant and emotionally unavailable. In discussions we've had about the relationship I had convinced myself and her that this was just who I was, and that she had to accept the fact that I like to be alone alot. 

&#x200B;

**The break-up:**

All of the above led to her breaking up with me. This somehow came as a surprise to me because I was living in my own bubble. She was extremely emotional and expressed that she still loved me alot and want the best for me, but did not see a future this way and needs time for herself. I accepted this pretty easily and I let her go. 

&#x200B;

Pretty soon after she broke up with me I realised what I had caused. I destroyed a perfectly fine relationship by ignoring my problems and letting it get the best of me. I decided to change all this and worked on finding a solution for my financial situation and I did. This opened up so much headspace and all my emotions that I had suppressed hit me hard. I was missing my ex, who was also my best friend, alot. I realise now that I have failed to give her the attention and affection that she needs. I took some time for myself to think things over. Can I offer her these things or is she looking for someone with other qualities? 

&#x200B;

After a month I came to the conclusion that I indeed can give her what she needs, like I did for the first 1.5 years of the relationship, and that the feelings that I still have for her are true. It was a long, heartfelt message and she immediatly wanted to come over to my place to discuss it. She came over and we had a long talk. I tried to explain to her that I feel like I can give her what she needs and that I need to better deal with problems in the future to avoid similar situations. She confirmed that she was very content with our relationship when things were good, but too much has happened and she can't get back together right now. But here come the mixed signals as the title suggests. While she says she feels like we can't get back together, during our talk she kept saying she still loves me deeply, misses me as a lover and as a friend, and wants to make me happy. We ended the talk telling each other that we would let things sink in and discuss it further on a later moment. 

&#x200B;

One week later I sent her another message asking how she felt about us after we've talked. She says she *can't make up her mind right now* and needs time for herself. While saying this she still expresses the fact that she loves me still and is very confused, but can't deal with it right now and *needs to find out for herself what she wants in life.*  I am absolutely devastated by this because I love her so deeply still. I am frustrated because I feel like this is the woman I should be marrying and I did not invest because I was incapable of doing so. 

&#x200B;

**My actual question:**

First of all thank you if you've come this far, I realise it's a lot of information but I felt like it was important to understand the situation. 

So what I've been wondering is if I should still seek contact with her or not. She said she needs time for herself and I am giving her that right now. But my feelings for her will not go away and I am increasingly missing her day by day. I legit feel like I want to grow old with this woman. Do I let her go and let her have the time to figure things out or should I let her know at some point in time that I still miss her and want to see her? 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

My girlfriend broke up with me because I was distant for a long time due to personal issues that I would not confront. I got my shit back together and reached out to her. She needs time for herself. This is potentially the woman of my life: Do I chase her or let her go?
