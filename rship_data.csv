0,,4,c76zii,2,"I don?t have the guts to tell him I?m questioning things right now so I wanna ask reddit if this sounds like a good/average relationship. Here?s what I?d say to him if I could: 

Positives: 

- I want to take care of you my whole life. Not in a need way, but a want way. I don?t trust anyone else to do it right/in the way you need it. I know no one else could take my place... not that I want anyone to take my place anyways. I?d be hurt and jealous. 

- I couldn?t imagine my life without you in it somehow. We?ve been friends for 6 years and even if we broke up I couldn?t stand not hearing from you. You?re my closest friend regardless of relationship status and I feel this... connection with you that I know is going to last a long time no matter how things end up. I?ll always take care of you and make sure you?re okay for the rest of my life (unless something happens to one of us) because seeing you happy is one of my favorite things in the world. It?s not even for my benefit, it?s just a pure thing... I love when you?re happy for once. You deserve the best that life has to offer and I hate seeing you suffer. If I can help it, I would do everything in my power to make you feel peace in your life. 

- I?d love to see your smile and hear your laugh every day. It fills me with a deep sense of calm-happiness to see you joyous. 

- I?d love to talk to you everyday. I?d be happy to listen to you complain about politics, work, whatever. 

- I love your hugs and kisses and feel safe in your arms. I?m attracted to you and you can turn me on quickly. 

- Our sex life is ?okay? at worst and ?WOW? at best. There?s things I wish we could work on but it?s overall not bad. Sometimes a little average, but like, whose isn?t eventually?

- You make me so proud when you accomplish the things you set out to do. I love watching you grow and I like being a part of that when possible. 

- We?re a team. I know you have my back through everything and I have yours. We could go anywhere, go through anything, and I know we?d be okay as long as we have each other. 

- You bring me up and I calm you down. We balance each other out and challenge each other to grow. 

- You annoy/embarrass me every single day, but somehow it?s charming. You force me to confront myself and how uptight I am. You teach me to let loose and be okay with myself being silly. 

- You always take care of me when I?m down/sick. You care for me like nobody has before and I feel a sense of security/peace/calmness/steadiness with you that I?ve never felt before with anyone. 

- My feelings for you have grown stronger and more secure in the time we?ve known each other. It?s been a slow burn but I respect and appreciate you more as times goes on. I care about you deeply and purely. 

- If it weren?t for my doubt and disconnect right now, I can 100% see marrying you and having a family. It feels more like a when than an if. More like a ?ok how do we improve our relationship so we?re the best us we can be? than a straight up ?this isn?t going to work.?

Negatives: 

- I don?t feel ?in-love? butterflies/passion with you most of the time. There are moments where I really feel it and they come pretty regularly, but they?re not constant like I?ve felt before in other relationships. Then again, those were terrible/unhealthy relationships. With you I feel peace, like a nice cup of tea (unless I?m busy being anxious about the conversation thing). 

- We have terrible conversation sometimes. I am a natural conversationalist and will talk about anything and everything with anybody, but you seem to lack this skill unless it?s in regard to your very specific hobbies or interests. I worry I don?t love you because I can?t emotionally/intellectually connect with you in this way. It feels hollow and missing, unfulfilling ? like there?s something wrong with our relationship. I wonder if this is an issue that can be worked on (social skills) or if it?s a trait that I need to accept. You seem to be able to hold a conversation with your family and my parents but not peers (or me sometimes), so like, maybe it?s just a anxiety thing... or my parents don?t really know you yet so you can talk more about yourself. I?ve known you for 6 years. 

- We don?t have the same sense of humor most of the time. There?s some stuff that sends us both reeling hard and I love those moments, but I wish I could make you laugh more often when I show you stuff I find funny/vice-versa. 

- You?re very socially awkward/unaware and while it?s endearing one on one, it gets embarrassing when we?re with friends or out in public. I see them judge you and I feel bad but I don?t want to pick at your flaws and make you feel worse. I try to bring it up gently when we?re alone but sometimes I get scared that I?ll hurt you. I?m very socially adept and this bothers me. But sometimes you surprise me, like when you talk to my parents. That always seems to go well. 

- I can?t fix your anxiety for you. I will support you the best I can but it?s not my job or within my ability to do it for you. Sometimes your anxiety stresses me out, but I promise to do my best to hold myself together/reassure you and tell you when I just can?t. I can?t promise you I will always do it well, but you?ll never have to go through it alone. The one time I abandoned you to deal with it alone is one of the biggest regrets of my life.

1,,4,c774c1,2,"My bf (17) is going out today with our mutual best friend (16), and that is totally fine by me, however before I started dating my boyfriend she was deciding between dating her current boyfriend (16)  and my current boyfriend. 5 months into her current relationship she realised she still has feelings for my boyfriend (whom I was not yet dating), when I started dating him she thanked me because now she could finally let those feelings go. I am unsure if she has and I want to explain the situation to my man but she swore me to secrecy. Another reason I'm upset is that I'm going to PNG tomorrow and won't be able to contact either of them for 2 weeks, my boyfriend is leaving for Japan in 5 days and will then be away for 10 days (again no contact) and he chose seeing her over seeing me and that's fine because he should hang out with his friends but it hurt my feelings.

2,,13,c74ng9,5,"So I've been seeing this girl for a few weeks now, and texting a lot every day for about a month. It feels like something pretty deep, we have a lot of chemistry, personality and otherwise, and have admitted we like each other a lot. But we also haven't really talked about this being exclusive yet and I still have a few fwb who I wouldn't mind sleeping with before this gets more serious. I'm asking because I feel like strictly speaking it's obviously not really wrong as we haven't established boundaries yet, but also it could be shitty to do this since I do like her more than anyone else I've dated and would like to be in a monogamous relationship with her. Oh and also we're both Finnish, but I lived most of my life in America and just moved back. This is adding to the problem for me because I feel like in the US this would've already been established as an actual relationship, but she mentioned that here it's usually slower or not talked about or whatever so idk if I'd be crossing an unspoken boundary, and I don't want to ask outright because of that.

4,,69,c6rvr6,178,"Another poster with a similar situation inspired me to post as well.

My wife has her own business she started when our daughter was born. She makes teething stuff, bibs, blankets, etc. This started in 2017 and was originally supposed to be a small thing she did in her spare time. 

Her mother got involved and it?s morphed into a monster. We are hugely in debt (I didn?t know how bad until recently) due to it. She has a card that is carrying as much debt in it as I make in a year! So we had a big blow up about that and I thought it was settled she would only work with what she has already. That didn?t hold true and I found out she has spent more on the business. Now she keeps investing even though her sales have been minimal. No more than $1000.00 each year. 

Now on top of the financial issues, she also spends every spare minute I?m not at work or sleeping working on the business or on social media for it. This leaves me to handle 90% of the household chores along with watching our daughter anytime I?m awake and not at work. I?ve expressed my concerned about this several times, including indicating that it was making our marriage suffer. Her retort is that because of my work and having to watch our daughter while I?m gone that she can?t get anything done for her business. I point out I?m only gone about 9 hours a day, so if I come home at 4pm and she works 4 that?s 8 pm. Which is pretty fair considering she does indeed get some work done during the day. Also I said if she wants to have 8 hours Saturday and Sunday I don?t mind. Instead of taking this reasonable schedule. She works until 11-1 at night  EVERY DAY! And then gets upset when I point out that she hasn?t spent time with our daughter or me, Hell most times I have to nag at her to take a shower etc because she begrudges the 20 minutes that that takes. 

Also the stress her mom and the business puts on her makes her constantly have breakdowns or outbursts. 

It came to a head when I went to pay our electric bill and I saw that our checking was down $200.00 more than it should have been and I was almost short of being able to pay the bill because she had bought something for her business.

She says I don?t support her in her endeavour either. Which isn?t true, in the beginning I always helped in any way I could. That?s how this whole routine started. Now I regret even that.

It?s not that she doesn?t make nice things, it just seems to not be working, it?s eating all her time and energy and quite honestly at this point I?m resentful. 

I even offered that we should go to counseling but she refused. Now at this point I?ve kind of started talking to different people online and I feel guilty but not that guilty honestly. Which scares me, I never ever wanted to be that guy. So I?m coming to the point of feeling like I have to set an ultimatum, but I have no idea if that will work and I just sit her wondering if anyone has a suggestion that can pull my marriage away from the cliff. Because she has to either cut back or just close this business and focus on us as a family or it will collapse.

5,,6,c75ijn,3,"There?s 7 of them: gf?s mom and stepdad, sister, cousin, niece and her 2 toddlers. Our apartment is 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom, 700sq ft. In our living room we have seating for only 5 people comfortably. We have an queen size air bed to accommodate 3 people and I guess one of them can take the couch.

I made an issue about the whole thing because I?m not accustomed to people imposing like that (I know my family wouldn?t do that given the size of our apartment), and we really don?t have enough room for everybody to be comfortable. And I need my own space, I?m an introvert who feels drained every after I?m around people for too long, I need a lot of alone time in peace.

So me and my Ex gf dated for about 4 years and earlier this year she moved away and broke off our relationship.

I can?t begin to describe how painful all of this is. 
I?d say this started about a month and some change ago. 
We were just going about our routine and then out of nowhere, I looked at her sweet, innocent face, and felt nothing. 
I didn?t feel disgusted or dissatisfied, I didn?t feel excited or loving, I felt nothing. 
I was so confused and distraught. It ruined the whole day. 
I got home that night and bawled my eyes out, racking my brain for what could make me feel this way. Scouring google for any hint of the problem. 
Flash forward a few weeks, and its too much to bear. So, I break up with her. 
She was utterly devastated, and so was I. 
I couldn?t even go the whole day without talking to her. 
We kept texting and agreed to give it another shot. I couldn?t picture my life without her, it hurt far too bad. 
After all, we have so many things in common, we agree on just about everything, and things just *click*. 

Everything was better for a while! Things started to go back to normal. I didn?t feel that emptiness from before. I grabbed hold of that spark again. 
But just a few days ago, I could feel it creeping back in, and I have the terrible omen that it?s here to stay. 
It?s not consistent, however. It can be from moment to moment. One moment, I?ll feel so much love and look in her eyes with immense passion, the next, I feel absolutely nothing. 
My girlfriend and I have some differences, and we?ve had some fights, but we?ve always worked through it. We never go to bed angry, and we?re relatively mature about handling argumentative affairs. 
I really did feel like this was someone I wanted to have children with. 
My family loves her, her family loves me. It feels like I?m the only one out of sync. 
I just so BADLY want to get this out of my head. I want to know if there?s any way this goes away, or do I have to face what it feels like this is pointing to. 
I really pray that it doesn?t have to end like this, but if it comes down to it, I need to make the decision that will let us both be happy in the long run.

10,,4,c75qxo,1,"About a month ago I met my current girlfriend. We hit it from the start and made it official two weeks back.

We've spent a lot of time together since and for someone so scared of attachment, I felt incredibly comfortable around here. She is in the same situation as me.

I haven't been in a relationship since highschool, when I dated someone who treated me like crap, cheated on me for months and lied to my face about it even though I knew she was. It fucked up my trust in people and ever since I've been fighting my anxiety, constantly trying to be rational and not let it take over.

Fast forwards to today and it is eating me up again. I've been having delusions that my current girlfriend is doing something behind my back.

She's a completely different person than my ex. When we meet up, she always asks me how I'm feeling, what I did that day, she treats me with respect, appreciates my every little gesture and overall trully cares about me, even though we've not known each other for so long.

Since I've spent so much time with a manipulative bitch, I'm well trained to smell crap a mile away and I really haven't sensed anything fishy.

I've told her about my history and warned her that I have trust issues and that she should consider being with me. She barely flinched, hugged me and told me to tell her when I'm troubled or I fear something is wrong.

After divorcing the mother of my children, I briefly dated a woman and broke up. After the break-up, she informed me that she was pregnant.  I told her that I had a lot on my plate and had no intention of being involved with this child's upbringing. We didn't talk until she informed me that she had given birth to a son, we'll cal him A. I was already moved on from her and had a lot on my plate and told her that. She was quite angry and threatened to take me to court, so we agreed that I would pay child support for him until he was 18. A kept his mothers last name. 

&#x200B;

we met at my house once about 9 months later with her, A, and her friend. This was the only time that I met A. I held him and looked at this baby and honestly felt no emotional connection to him. This was not my son. I was not his father. Her friend took a photo of me holding A and I assume she still has this. During the visit, my son (8) and daughter (10) were upstairs and came down after hearing us all talking and became infatuated with this baby and were holding him, playing with him, etc. They had no idea that he was their biological brother. 

&#x200B;

A's mother called me once when he was about 3/4  years old and told me that A wanted to meet me and was asking questions about me. I explained to her that I was not willing to do this and had moved on. This was 19 years ago and I haven't thought of them really since and have not told anyone in my family of this.

About 3 weeks ago, A called me. I don't know how he got my number but he explained that he didn't feel animosity towards me but wanted to meet me. Curious, and a little sympathetic, I hesitantly obliged and agreed to meet him the next week for lunch. 

&#x200B;

Last week I drove 2 towns over and met A at a restaurant. The second he walked in I recognized him immediately, he looked just like his bother and just like me; tall, slim, short blonde hair, well dressed. I stood up and shook his hand for the first time and looked him in the eye. I was astonished. This was my son. Although I was meeting him for the first time it felt I already knew him. After greeting each other and making small talk, I started asking about him and was quite impressed.he was 22 years old, an air force pilot who had spent a year travelling north Africa and southeast Asia after high school. I asked about his mother and he asked about me and my side of his bloodline. When the conversation got to my children it became quite tense. He already knew that I had a son (29) and a daughter (32) but asked if they knew about him. I explained that they had no idea that he existed as did the rest of my family. I could see he was disappointed on hearing this, as if he was hoping to have a relationship with the brother and sister he never knew. We finished our lunch and agreed to keep in touch. We shook hands and he called me by my first name.  During the drive home, I couldn't help but feeling a bit sad that I had missed out on this boys life.

Throughout the past week I've been really thinking and decided that I want to tell my son and daughter about their brother.

The friend that she cheated on me with still has a massive crush on her and she is actually quite open about it to her closer.

My girlfriend insists that she would never do it again and that she deeply regrets hooking up with her in the first place.I don?t know if I believe her or not.
I understand that me having a problem with her being bisexual is slightly homophobic(or biphobic??is that a thing?) but I am genuinely worried about the prospect of her cheating on me again.

18,,3,c76jj1,2,"Throwaway account. Tldr at bottom. 


My husband has been talking about buying a motorcycle forever but we?ve never been financially able to do it. 


Right now, he?s been in school for the past year and I?ve been working nonstop to support us, and our child. We even had to move in with my parents because there was no way we could pay all our bills, plus full time childcare, and make rent, on only one income in our area. 


I don?t have the best relationship with my mother, but she also needed help with paying her mortgage and splitting it with her was cheaper than renting on our own, and we have more space in the house than we would in an apartment. It?s actually caused a lot of stress and anxiety on us (my parents, my husband, and myself.) My mom recently started working again, and doesn?t really need us around to help with bills anymore so even more incentive to move out. 


He?s almost done with school and was offered a job (thank god) with the start date a month away. We are very excited and happy, and we were waiting for this so that we could move out and be in our own.  I?m very proud of him, because I know he?s felt shitty for not being able to provide financially for this past year. 


He wants to buy a motorcycle this weekend. I told him we should wait until he actually has a job. He said the guy at the dealership told him that all he needed to see was the offer letter from his new job to be able to put in an application to finance. 


I said, ok cool but we live paycheck to paycheck, don?t you need to come up with a down payment? His idea is that we cash in my life insurance and use that for a down payment. He only knows about it because we were struggling for money so bad a few months ago that I actually looked into it, and the most we could even get is like $1500 so I decided it wasn?t worth it. His other idea is that we ask my parents, which is think is insane considering we already live with them. 


He also wants me to co-sign for this bike, and thinks I?m being a jerk for telling him to at least wait until he?s actually getting paid. 


I?ve also asked him to price out what the monthly payments, insurance, maintenance, gear, etc would look like, and so far he hasn?t delivered anything. He just keeps saying ?it?ll be around $100/mo? but I have friends and co-workers who have motorcycles and said this isn?t the case. Keep in mind, both of us have horribly shitty credit (now) and he has multiple points on his license. 


This whole time, our plan was for him to graduate from school and get a job so that we could pay off a good sum of our debts, and move into our own place. But now he?s saying he?d rather get a motorcycle first, and figure the rest out after. He made decent money before school, but would be able to make more with a certification to put in his resume, and this was a plan that we had agreed to before he stopped working and went back to school, so it?s troubling that now that it?s actually happening, he wants to sway from the plan. 


To make it worse, there?s a specific bike that he wants and in his words ?if we don?t get it now it will be gone.? He?s being so irrational about the whole thing that it?s honestly making me rethink our whole marriage. 


It?s cheaper for me to take public transit to work, so he takes the car everyday, and drops out daughter off at preschool before school, which is the same as it will be when he starts working. The motorcycle will be his ?weekend toy.? 


I?m not opposed to him having a bike. But I am opposed to making a big purchase on something when we have other, more pressing, financial obligations to think about, and I think it?s stupid that he would want to get a bike this very second when he won?t even get his first pay check for another five weeks. 


People around me are telling me I?m being a party pooper or whatever, because I know how much he wants the bike. But I just think there?s a smarter way to go about this. 


Any advice on this would be great because I feel like I?m losing my mind. We?ve been arguing nonstop and I just want to stop arguing, but I also don?t want to financially screw myself over by just giving in.

So I have recently found out that my girlfriend of 2 years and 9 months is cheating on me, or at least plans to be cheating on me very soon.

[Some light background on us: As stated we have been together for almost 3 years, we are sharing a flat, no kids or pets or any long term commitments to each other, the most significant thing we have together is that she helped to contribute to buying our car (50/50 split) but is unable to drive it as she has no full drivers licence.]

We began to drift apart around 6 months ago. Sex became less frequent and our general attitude became slightly more agitated with each other, however, we did both try to stay positive and keep things going as we loved each other.

Around 2 weeks ago she became more and more distant, and would strongly suggest I stay in the living room after we had finished eating to stay and play games or watch a film while she would go to our room and browse on her phone. That was fine for a day or two but when it became a constant, it became slightly more suspicious. After I came to bed, she would immediately lock her phone if I glanced over at her, otherwise would pull the duvet over her to browse her phone in peace.

Yesterday while she was in the shower I decided to unlock her phone and check her WhatsApp messages. I know, I know it?s not a very trusting thing to do to your partner and I am in no way perfect in this story, but I had a hunch that something was amiss. I was right to do so as her top contact was from ?Charlotte2? and containing very explicit messages between my girlfriend and ?Darren? as well as plans to meet up this upcoming Wednesday and how she ?wished she was there right now?. 

Her cover to me, was that she would be heading out after work with some workmates and they would all jump in one car tomorrow morning to save on petrol. I had no reason to doubt this (at the time) but it is now clear that that was a lie to meet up with Darren. I was filled with frustration, jealousy, depression and a whole other mix of emotions that I couldn?t quite pin down. I took some pictures of the conversation on my phone for future evidence and tried as hard as I could to gather my thoughts through the rest of the day while maintaining ignorance.

Currently, she is away at a friend?s house this evening and won?t be back until tomorrow (and I know she is there and not with Darren) while I pace up and down our flat figuring things out.

22,,7,c74bo9,3,"Reddit, I need guidance.

My boyfriend (30M) and I (30F) have been together for seven years. I genuinely love the guy, but there is a significant pattern of him not pulling his weight in our relationship. 

We have known each other for almost 18 years and have a lot of history. I moved to Texas to finish college when we reconnected seven years ago, so we did the long distance thing for a year before he moved to be with me. My parents helped him with rent while he got on his feet and found a job. Eventually, he became unhappy and quit that job. I don't remember how long he was out of work that time, but eventually he got another job until he became unhappy and decided to quit again. This has been a pattern in our relationship, and I am left to pick up the financial pieces each time. At one point he wasn't working for over a year. Turns out there were some circumstances out of his control, but it was still a big struggle financially. Sometimes he picks up the slack at home.. Doing laundry, dishes, and light cleaning. But he doesn't seem to see that I am still doing more while also hustling to pay our rent and bills. I have been in a teacher certification program and will start student teaching in August. This is essentially an internship where I will be working full-time with no pay for 3 months. Boyfriend and I have been discussing this for about a year, and he said he would cover us during that time. He said he owes it to me based on how I've carried us in the past. However, in April he started getting down and depressed and ended up quitting yet another job. He keeps ensuring me everything will work out, but I'm really starting to stress as it gets closer to August and he has nothing lined up. I have been harsh in the past, so I've really tried to just be supportive this time but it doesn't seem to make a difference. He had mentioned delivering for postmates if things got too tough, but when I asked if he would start he straight up said, ?no.?

The real kicker is that he's started to give me a hard time for taking extra jobs or going to hang out with my friends. Saying he misses me when I'm gone and wants to spend more time with me. He's also been getting upset when I'm not down for sex (I typically take REALLY GOOD care of him in this department), saying I don't love him or don't care. I am truly at a loss. I do love him and want to support him, but I am struggling. He doesn't seem to understand my side of it, and the discussion is now just turning into a big fight every time because I'm so stressed. I honestly don't know what kind of advice can even be offered, but I'm ready to hear it. Thank you for reading, and allowing me to get this off my chest!

He blames me for a lot of things in his therapy sessions (says I'm causing him more stress, make his dissociation worse, etc.). I feel so horrible every time he says I'm overwhelming him, and I try to take his feelings very seriously. It's gotten to the point that I don't even feel comfortable telling him when I'm upset because he makes me feel like I'm just placing another burden on him.

&#x200B;

The other night, the two of us smoked a little weed. I smoke several nights a week before bed because it helps with my anxiety and PTSD (I can go into detail about my mental health if necessary to answer a question, but I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to make my mental/emotional struggles the focus of this situation). He berates me for smoking so frequently and I've heard him talk to his therapist about me using marijuana in a very belittling manner. But, he smokes weed, too, just not as often. We got high, did a few minor house chores, and watched TV. Then, I fell asleep next to him while he was playing video games.

&#x200B;

A couple hours later, he wakes me up and he's standing over me. He's staring at me really intently and his voice is both aggressive and dismissive, like when I try to discuss something with him and it turns into an argument. He demands that I come outside and talk to him, even though it's almost 2 am. I'm still groggy but I follow him upstairs and outside because he seems really upset and I'm nervous that something happened while I was asleep.

&#x200B;

Outside, I notice he smells like cigarettes, which means that he went through my bag and took them (I keep the cigarettes in my bag because we're trying to stop smoking and so we only smoke 1 a day. We had already smoked once that day). He starts yelling at me about cheating on him or talking to some guy on Whisper (an app) about a hookup or something. I'm confused because even though people do message me on Whisper asking for nudes or hookups or whatever, I never answer them and I certainly don't flirt back. I'm also confused because this means he went through my phone while I was asleep. I keep telling him that I wasn't cheating or talking to anyone about anything, but he won't listen. It takes a long time for him to stop yelling at me. He tells me to delete the app, so I did. We eventually just go inside and the next morning, he tried to act like nothing happened. I was really hurt by what he had said the previous night, and I tried to talk with him about it, but he just got that mean tone again.

&#x200B;

This incident came right after a big argument we had a couple days prior. I was upset because I told him it felt like there was a big double standard between him and myself. He doesn't want me to smoke weed, but he can. He doesn't want me to tell him my problems, but he wants me to always be there for him. It just feels unfair and blah blah blah. There was a lot more to it, obviously. But, he basically retorted that I put him in a bad place mentally because I'm so fucked up and he doesn't want to have to deal with me. During this argument he also implied I was disgusting him because I asked him to just stop fighting and come eat (it was around dinner time) and he said I had made him ""lose his appetite"".

There are several more incidents like this, including times we've had arguments while away at college and he's thrown things at me and/or thrown around and made a mess of my possessions, or the time he took off his engagement ring and threw it at the wall before storming out of my dorm room.

26,,10,c766jx,1,"This is a very long story in the making, so I hope I can explain it in a way that makes sense. 

My sister and I grew up very close, we were best friends our entire childhood and majority of our 20?s. 
She started dating, let?s call him josh when she was 16. I started dating my now husband, let?s call him dan when I was 17. We would often go on double dates together. We were like 4 peas in a pod. Well, my sister (cheated on josh several times) and he found out and they broke up after 6 years of dating. Josh was well liked within our family and treated my sister very well. 

My sister moved out of state after they broke up. I let her live in my apartment on the couch for months after josh asked her to move out. Her personality had changed during this time. I felt like I barely knew her. She was very spiteful. I heard from her friends that she was doing cocaine. Her mood was labile during this time. She started stripping and working as a cam girl. She has grown out of this since, and has a career and master?s degree now... and she is now married herself.

Well, my husband dan and josh are best friends. They have been for over decade, prior to my sister and him breaking off their relationship. My sister never had a problem with this... until josh started seriously dating another girl 4 years ago. 

And I can?t even begin to explain the amount of harassing and berating I have endured from her since then. She demands that my husband and myself are not friends with josh and his now wife. (My husband was josh?s best man and josh was his ). She texted me once and told me to push joshs wife off a cliff. She will see things on social media and send screen shots to me, my mom and other sister (with penises drawn on my face). I know it sounds so immature typing this out. She calls me all sorts of names. She tells me I?m a horrible sister for being friends with her ex boyfriend. They literally broke up 8 years ago and this was never a big issue until josh started dating someone 4 years ago. She goes out of her way to hurt my feelings, leave me out of things. She won?t ever come to an agreement with me. For years i empathized with her, I reassured her that I loved her, she was my family, that I can?t ask my husband to stop being friends with his best friend. 

Last year, after josh got married, I had to block her from my phone for a few months - bc she would text me 100 times a day. She felt that I shouldn?t have gone to his wedding (my hubby was the best man and I?m not going to miss that) . She was even saying that she was going to get married on his wedding day so I?d have to choose. She didn?t end up doing that. Josh and his wife have even tried to talk to my sister to assure her that we can all be friends and civil. After that my sister left a fake negative google review on josh?s business he had just started. 

She also has no long time friends. All of them have had some falling out that resulted in giant text arguments and petty social media posts. So many of my friends Unfriended her on social media because of the way she treats me. My best friends tell me they wish I would cut her out because she is toxic. 

She starts group chats with my mom and other siblings to get them involved too- which they are totally worn out over too. And I?m talking hundreds of extremely mean hearted texts. 

She once posted a picture of me (she claims on accident) and one of my friends that slept with josh on a local gossip website and the description did not decipher which girl it was about and it was like ?this is a dirty whore has herpes?. My coworker pointed it out to me... 

She made a scene at my wedding after drinking a bottle of wine in 20 minutes... then cried hysterically out in the parking lot. She was my maid of honor and never even made her speech. On my wedding night She had my out of town friend ?take her home? and she gave him directions to Josh?s house instead... and  kicked and broke the antenna off his car. 

After I unblocked her Earlier this year, i told her that I cannot tolerate fighting with her about this anymore. And that we should just not talk about it anymore because it?s ruining our relationship. She agreed. 

This past weekend... she started up with the fighting again after being silent for 6 months. She bought hats for a trip that my other sister and her went on,  that I was excluded from, making fun of a trip that my husband and I went on with a big group of friends (her ex was there). She posted a picture to my other sisters social media story, without her knowledge. She admittedly did this ?so now you can feel the pain I feel? and ?yeah I was making fun of you, that?s how I process things that hurt me, is to laugh about it? She says things like ? I just want you to be friends with me more than you?re friends with them?. And ?yeah I did it on purpose because you?re a shitty sister? (these things make me not want to put effort into our relationship or be around her) I?ll admit- I reacted poorly to this. I called her some names and this time I was not apologetic for going on that trip with a group of close friends. I was very angry and hurt. In the past I would have empathized with her. 


She accuses me of not showing up for things and being flakey, which is genuinely not true. She got married this year in Vegas and gave us very little notice. I want to say we got a 6 weeks notice. She picked the most expensive weekend to go (first Friday) and we still went even though it costed us thousands of dollars we didn?t really have on hand. I also threw her a last minute engagement party. 

I just finished my masters program so I?ve been really busy for the past two years doing that and working full time. She is upset I don?t come to see her out of state. I actually just couldn?t afford to take the time off. I am the bread winner and worked as floor nurse and would often get low work load and had to use my pto to fill in for it. I?ve told her that. Well now that I?m done with school (and doubled my income), I bought plane tickets last month to go see her. But now, after this past weekend, I really do not want to go. She goes out of her way (and admits it) to hurt me. I cried a lot yesterday. But I feel like I don?t deserve to be treated the way she treats me and don?t want to subject myself to it either. My husband does not care for her and doesn?t want to go now either. I don?t know what I can do to fix this, if anything.

Lately, he?s been distant and only gives me attention if it?s sexual (he grabs my thighs or jokes about how we should have sex). I told him the other night if he wants to go back to being fwb to let me know, because I?m not interested in that.

I got transferred somewhere else, I met somebody, we were together for 4 years and never thought about A as we were only work friends, we would bump in to each other and have a brief chat at meetings or whatever.

Fast forward to 8 months ago, I get transferred again, now I'm working with A again. She had recently broke up with her ex. We get on very well.

My feelings grew for her, it isn't often a meet people I get on with in general. Anywho, we went out for a work party, we got drunk, we kissed, spoke about it a few days later and laughed.

We are getting quite friendly. Then she found out she was pregnant with her ex as they were still sleeping together. Which I'm sure we've all been guilty off, I have.

Anyway, ex isn't interested in the kid. She wants to keep friendly with him as she wants her kid to have a dad figure. She has told me she has no interest in being in a relationship with the baby's father.

Now for where I need advice. The more time I spend with her outside of work, cinema, at her place etc. the more my feelings grow for her, she's now six months pregnant (this doesn't bother me in the slightest) but I'm scared the longer I wait to tell her the more of a friend I become and less of a potential partner.

I'm scared of what will happen if she rejects me as we work together. (Least of my worry) My worst fear is that everything goes well, we grow close then the baby comes along and they fall in love again.

Maybe I'm over thinking things too much, maybe I should just go for it? We haven't done anything since the drunk night out, I think she knows I like her and I think she maybe likes me but I don't actually know.

Boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months.

I?ve  been working for two and a half years in a contract job and had to go  through a lengthy internal competition process to get a permanent  position. It was a lot of hard work. He knows this.

I  told him and my friends that I got the permanent position. Several  different work acquaintances  have offered to take me out for  celebratory drinks or dinner. My boyfriend said we should get wine and  celebrate, but he never followed through.

He  has a pattern of doing this. Said he would take me for dinner for my  birthday but he never did. I took him out for dinner for his birthday.  Said we would visit his hometown this summer. The opportunity arose and  he took his brother. Now he?s hearing about others congratulating and  taking me out but not doing anything himself. I thought he might do  something this weekend, but indirectly found out that he made plans with  other friends instead. And no, he?s not planning some elaborate  surprise dinner or something.

Our relationship is pretty one-sided. I make the effort to go to his house, we hang out there all the time. I give more sexually than he does. We do what is convenient for him. He would rather stay in and play video games every single time we hang out than make the effort to go out and celebrate with me.

It?s not  that I am expecting anything from anyone but I cannot help but feel that  were the roles reversed, I know I would have taken him out or at least  brought home a bottle of bubbly. I would have celebrated his  achievements. I thought that people in relationships should do that for  one another, celebrate the good times, be there for each other in the  tough times and all that.

How do I tell him I feel hurt by this? I mean he technically hasn?t done anything wrong but his lack of caring makes me sad. It makes me feel like the real underlying issue is that he does not value me or think I am worth it, which makes me question the relationship.",How do I (29f) talk to my bf (29m) about the fact that he doesn't celebrate my accomplishments?,1.0
38,,6,c768un,6,"So I had been dating this one girl for around 7 months before this shitstorm happened. I?m not referring to her as my girlfriend or ex because I?m simply so confused have an idea of what to do, but I don?t know exactly how to do it. Anyways, I?ll explain.

During our relationship, around April, we got into a big argument. This was regarding a party she was going to. The party was a celebration of summer and a ton of people were going. I, however, was unable to go since I would be out of the country on a week long vacation on the day it fell. Once I returned, I was to join her and her family on a trip to different state for another week. I expressed that I wouldn?t be comfortable with her going to the party, given that I?d be gone and the party was going to have tons of people and tons of alcohol, and was worried that she might do something or get taken advantage of. I mentioned that her going would make me super worried and would put me in a bad mood for our subsequent trip. Upon me saying this, I got called an asshole, a controlling boyfriend, and told I didn?t want her to have friends. She even made a reddit post on r/amitheasshole and I got slandered for this. Eventually I fell through and got guilted into believing that I was wrong and had to just let it slide. I figured if she hasn?t done it before, she wouldn?t do it (I?m not saying I was right to do it, I?m just adding that little information). She reassured me over and over that nothing would happen and to not worry as well as promising me repeatedly.

In the last month, she started acting differently. Doing little things, like talking to me less, being less affectionate, and then asking for a break, then immediately changing her mind. I would notice certain things, and she?d dismiss me and call me annoying and paranoid, so that?s what I chalk it up to. Eventually the days before I leave, we hang out and everything is great, we?re super affectionate towards each other, and all of my worries vanish. We say our goodbyes and that?s that. All seemed great.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I get to the country I?m currently in and I?m having a great time. The party is still in the back of my mind, and by that time is forced myself to make myself believe that nothing is going to happen. The next morning rolls around, and I wake up to a text saying ?I?m sorry? and another saying ?I love you so much?. This trips me out so I ask her what she means and if she?s saying sorry because something happened. She tells me initially that no, nothing did, lying to me. 

Hours later she tells me that in fact, she made out with some other guy there. I?m devastated at this news. Not only was this a relationship for me, but I genuinely cared for her so much. It was the one person I felt most comfortable with and opened up to so much with, and told her about my battles with depression and past scars in my life. I felt so betrayed, lied to and let down. I got told that she?s so sorry over and over and that she regrets it, but nothing she did helped. I cried to myself all night and didn?t sleep. Ever since then I?ve been sporadically crying to myself over and over just thinking about it, and she currently is and hasn?t been doing anything to help me at all in the slightest.

After the day I found out, I forgave her. It was only making out, I figured. I told her that she wasn?t going to get my trust back for a while, that I was right about the party and was essentially guilted into feeling like an asshole and that my worried were now justified, that she hurt me so badly, and that I didn?t know if I was sure about going on the trip with her family or not. She told me she wanted me to go still, so I figured fine, we?ll go together, forget about it there, have fun, and then have a whole summer together. 


However I asked if she could not talk to the guy she made out with, as if I was to hesitantly let it slide, I wouldn?t be comfortable with it at all. Initially, she agreed and that was that. But later I found out via her sister that she was constantly talking to him behind my back, while I was out doing activities and trying my hardest to enjoy the time I had here thanks to the constant weight of sadness I now had. I confronted her on it and asked if she was talking to him, and she denied it. I then showed her the proof of her talking to him that her sister showed me, and she snapped at me. She told me that I should have noticed her being distant with me the past month, which I had the whole time, and that me kissing someone else is a sign. I ask why she even is having me go on the trip with her, to which I get no definite answer. Eventually she tells me she wants me to go and she?s sorry.

Hours later we start talking and further along the way, I ask, ?are you still talking to so-and-so?? I know I shouldn?t have asked I just couldn?t help it that it was on my mind 24/7 and enraged me. This causes her to snap and tell me we?re done, and to leave her alone. This puts me in a dilemma because I have the trip with her and her family coming up and I?d have to deal with the issue of talking to her family, my family, and cancelling the flight. I was also really looking forward to it since it was a place I?d never been before. I just don?t know what to do. I feel so conflicted. I love her and hate her at the same time. I want to see her so badly and I know vice versa, but she?s being weird since I?m currently away. Every time we?re together we get along and have argued only a couple of times, it just whenever I?m gone is when we?ve had bad arguments. I feel like seeing her would be better, but at the same time I feel like I shouldn?t since she just makes me feel bad and like I?m responsible for everything bad that happened. This whole trip has that I?m just trying to enjoy has been ruined and I feel like seeing her would help, but I also am unsure. Do I go? Her whole family likes me and has sided with me, so I figure regardless I can have a good time and enjoy a new experience, regardless of if we make up again.

39,,9,c76eoh,2,"So to keep the reason we went on a break simple, he felt as if he needed time alone to work on himself personally, so I suggested we go on a no contact break for three weeks (cause he?s going on holidays for 2 weeks and a bit).

He is exactly everything I want in a man and when i am with him he treats me like he has never wanted anybody more (physically but mostly emotionally). 

We don't live in the same state so I see him every 2 - 3 weeks cause we both travel a lot. He is 30 I am 25. I have been with a lot of men, relationships and just sex and he is the best of them all. No one has ever understood me like he does or been as sweet as he is. 

BUT. We talk every day, except right after we have seen each other where he disappears for 4-5 days. Obviously, being the proud person I am I will not text him, usually. But then we somehow start talking every day again and it just never really gets boring for me.

42,,58,c73i4o,148,"I?m a mess and on mobile so I?m sorry if this makes no sense. My boyfriend of almost 2 years has essentially been living a double life. I?m baffled as to how he pulled this off. When we met, he told me he was on the tail end of a nasty lengthy divorce, but that he had moved on and it would never pose an issue, and until now he was right, it never has. Last week I took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning I had a OBGYN visit to confirm. I was honestly ecstatic, I?ve always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven?t been together for the longest time. I was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. His face went pale and he looked confused, not what I expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn?t know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. Not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he?s been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. I have no idea how I never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. That being said, it?s not like he hardly spent any time with me. I?m heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. I?m still pregnant, with his third child, and he?s still very much married. He left right after that conversation, and I?ve called and texted but the only response I?ve gotten is that he?ll speak to me tomorrow night after work. His demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that I?m terrified he?s going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. Another part of me doesn?t want him anymore. If he?s this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? What else COULD he lie about? I also would hate to break up a family like this. I feel disgusted in this whole situation, I?ve never felt more alone and confused. Should I be preemptive and leave him or are there other ways I could go about this?

Update: I think it?s clear that I need to leave him, but that?s about all that?s clear for me right now. I want to be a mom, but these are the worst circumstances for that that I can imagine. I?m trying to think of ways to contact his wife and can?t think of any. I do believe I was at the house where they once lived at one point, but he has moved since then (allegedly) so I have no idea what the new address is. I can?t seem to piece this together at all. I don?t understand how I was fooled for so long, I think I?m still in shock. To recap, I am leaving, I?m not sure if I want to abort, and as much as I want to tell his wife I have no way of doing that. I guess I?ll wait until he speaks with me tomorrow.

43,,11,c74oyz,1,"Is my husband gaslighting me, or am I truly unreasonable? can we fix this or make it work?

TLDR: I have a high conflict relationship with my husband and I don?t know what to do. 

I don?t have time to make this look pretty. I love lists and I tried not to ramble. You do ask for as much info as possible in the rules so here you go:


I am at the absolute end of my rope with my husband. I feel like I have spent four years repeating myself over and over and over and I just can?t do it anymore. I need to know if these scenarios are gaslighting or if it?s me. And I really do want honesty, if I am wrong then I would like to work on these things. I?ll give some background that might be relevant and some true interactions (from my point of view and also what he expressed to me as his point of view). I can?t go to any of my friends about this because it?s so embarrassing that I?m in this awful relationship. My therapist and I are working on something completely different right now and I don?t have the capacity to work on both. 

We have been together for four years married for two. We are 8 years apart, I?m 32 and he is 40. He was two children who are teenagers from a previous marriage and an extremely problematic and greedy ex wife. We have one child together who is almost a year old. We did move quickly and when we met he acted very differently than what I am going to describe. He was self-described as ?easy going? (important when you?re fiesty like me), he is handsome, he?s funny, he was interested in me, he listened, he made me feel safe and loved, and these are very important things to me because I never received love and I never felt safe as a child. I was abused physically, emotionally, mentally, and sexually. I am very open about my trauma, I know when I am triggered, what triggered it, and I am able to communicate what the problem is, how it affects me, and a solution that would have worked better for me. I have an upper leadership job and communication is always one of my strengths. I?m in therapy working on my triggers and my CPTSD, and I also am seeing a psychiatrist and have gotten medication to treat it. The medication has stopped my nightly night terrors/nightmares, have relieved a lot of my anxiety and fear, and I?m working on not only expressing that I?ve been triggered but actually learning how to work through my triggers. All of the things that I loved about him, all went away after we got married. 

Because of my past I have a hard time determining what is ok and what isn?t. I know have some codependent tendencies and I?m working on that. I also am able to let things go pretty easily. All I?m looking for is that he validate my feelings, acknowledge me, apologize when I feel him I don?t like something, and that?s it. I?m happy with that. I don?t nag, I don?t keep going, that?s literally all I need. I have actively and consistently demonstrated this in our relationship. I mean it when I say it. I?m not looking for much. 

I always try to make amends for any wrongs I?ve committed. I admit head on what I?ve done, I apologize, and I make a genuine effort not to repeat the behaviors. When he expresses himself to me, and tells me that I?ve made him fe el a certain type of way the FIRST thing I do is apologize and ask how I can make him feel better. When I notice that I?ve *actually* said something with an attitude I IMMEDIATELY apologize and fix it. When he apologizes and acknowledges my feelings I?m fine. 

I recognize that I am not perfect. I can be a bit of a control freak due to my anxiety (again, my background, again, something I?m currently working through), I have a hard time containing my initial reaction which can be bigger than I how I actually feel about the situation but it takes me 5 seconds to come to terms. 

 I am however, reasonable. I mean it when I say I communicate, I really do put in the effort, I know my shortcomings and I am actively making an effort to improve myself. I know that I had a rough start but I also believe that we can grow and learn and not be held back by our pasts. I don?t want to pass dysfunction down to my son and I?m afraid as long as his dad and I continue like this it?s all he will know.


My husband also experienced trauma. His mother was an addict who would sleep for days on end. He had no supervision, no one taking care of him, he was neglected. Then at a young age he met his ex wife who is a real life jekyl and Hyde and will turn on a dime and contradict herself in the same sentence. She is manipulative, lies, cant keep her lies straight- for example she says she loves fish and then 10 minutes later she never touches the stuff- but like with every single thing all the time. It?s exhausting. So I get it. I know he?s been through stuff. But he also will not go get help for it. I mean, of course he says he will, but he doesn?t. We did go to three sessions of couples therapy but I couldn?t go anymore because instead of seeing it as a place to seek ways to communicate, build trust, learn what the other needs, he saw it as having a referee and just wanted to talk about all the things I do wrong. I told him he had to go to individual therapy and work out his issues and then we can do couples. I?m still in individual, he of course isn?t. And he won?t communicate to me what his issues are or how we can work through them. He can?t take any kind of feedback, he takes it as a personal criticism and it?s game over. And he has an excuse for everything too. He?s constantly defensive but it?s my fault he?s like that. He flips everything on me but he says that I?m doing that to him. I?ll explain in more detail below. 

I don?t know what to do anymore. I lived with conflict my whole life and I just don?t understand why it?s so hard for us. What makes it more frustrating is he will commit to making an effort to listen to my needs and communicate and for awhile he actually does make an effort. And I notice it, and I TELL HIM I notice it and I THANK HIM! And it?s always only a matter of time before I say something wrong and we are back to square one. I am exhausted. 

I also can?t leave. I pay 3/4 of our bills and I know he can?t survive on his own and pay child support for three kids. It makes more sense for us to stay living under the same roof. I have three ideal scenarios:

1. the most ideal is that he gets some therapy and starts acting like the mature, emotionally intelligent person that I know he can figure out how to be and we have a happy marriage. 

2. We remain married and still generally function the same, but we have an ?open? marriage. I feel like if I can get what I need from someone else emotionally then there will be less pressure on him to meet my needs and we can stay surface level and we can both date outside of our marriage and also be married to each other. 

3. We end our relationship but remain living together and work our a schedule wit our son that will allow us to both see him and both have time to away. 

Also relevant these are my triggers/my asks/common issues/misc information: 

1. My main Trigger: Ignoring me, walking away from me, not making eye contact with me, generally giving the cold shoulder/silent treatment 
       
Why: This is because my mother did this to me. She would pretend that I wasn?t there. She would turn music up loudly in the car so she couldn?t hear me talking or crying or whatever I was doing. She would give attention to everyone in the room except me, she wouldn?t even look at me. She would tell me she can?t look at me because it makes her sick. I?ve told this a thousand times to him, yet it is still his go to any time he is upset with me, which is often. I never felt loved, I was told I wasn?t loved, that I am unworthy of love. My husband makes me feel these exact feelings almost daily with actions that he can control and he choose not to. When I do something he doesn?t like I have no idea what I?ve done and he just shuts down, won?t make eye contact, won?t speak to me, and then refuses to tell me why he?s acting like that and will just say ?I?m fine? 

My compromise/what I communicate with him: it?s ok to need a break. It?s not ok to just walk away and ignore me. This was even discussed in therapy. That he can say ?I need an hour/10 minutes/some time, but I will be back and we can discuss it.? We discussed in therapy that it shouldn?t be more than an hour. He has never once done this. Eye contact to me isn?t negotiable. It?s so dehumanizing that he won?t even look at me.  I just want him to commit to memory things about me, realize how I talk and what I?m saying are not attacks and just relax, and actually care enough about me to want to hear what I?m feeling, who I am, what I need to be fulfilled in a relationship, how he can make me feel safe and loved. And I want him to tell me the same for him. Instead he does the same things over and over and over and I don?t get it. 

2. Trigger: things disappearing/moving
Why: nothing I owned was ever mine growing up. I had no privacy. I had no possessions. My mother bought everything so she owned everything, this included me, and she often threw away or gave away (so I could still see it you know) my things to prove that point. I get major anxiety if I know I?ve put something somewhere and now it?s gone.

 All I ask is that he mention to me ?hey I?m putting this with the ___? or ?is there somewhere you want to put this?? He agrees he will do this but literally never does and then gets upset with me when I ask about something and he never mentioned he moved it and he can?t remember where he put it which happens 3-5 times a week and no I?m not kidding. 


3. His biggest issue with me is every word that comes out of my mouth (not  hyperbole) I apparently say with an attitude, and/or I?m attacking him, and/or I?m implying something that I?m not saying, etc. this is never true. I am an excitable person and I talk loud but it?s charisma. It?s what the people who like me, like about me. And it feels like he hates that about me. I have told him I don?t hear what he?s hearing so when it happens if he can point it out to me so I can become aware and stop doing it that would be amazing. He has never once done that. He says I?m constantly attacking him, judging him, criticizing him. 

4. Every time we fight (constantly) he?s so defensive about everything that he immediately says he wants to divorce or insists that I want to.  I don?t get it. Why can?t we have a conflict without him trying to leave?

5. Also every time we fight we waits until I?m literally to the point where I?m bawling my eyes out, repeatedly trying to get him to communicate with me, and repeatedly communicating my exact same needs (that have literally never changed) every time over and over, and I?m at the point of just devastation and then he says I?m right and he?s sorry. Sometimes it?s not until the next day because he likes me to really suffer. And he ALWAYS says I?m right and he?s sorry, but it?s not until first I?m at my breaking point. 

6. When we argue he focuses on one thing, and it?s literally never the actual issue. And even when I say very explicitly the issue is this, he will saw that it?s actually that because I said that before so he knows that?s what the real problem is and then he will broken record it over that one thing that is completely irrelevant. 

7. He used to have a legit drinking problem and these issues were a lot more volatile when he did. He was drinking the huge bottles of whiskey and going through at least one a week as well as a 12 pack (at least) of beer completely on his own. I never told him to stop but we did talk about how I feel like it?s a lot and he has almost completely stopped. He drinks very occasionally and we don?t even keep hard liquor anymore. He has an addictive personality but he also is able to just drop things too. He?s done the same with cigarettes. 

8. We have never been physical and I have never been afraid of that 


Here are some of the things that I carry with me from our relationship:

1. Our wedding day. On our wedding day I was pretty badly injured.  Two years later and I have a permanent disfigurement from the fall I took the day before my wedding. I was in a lot of pain, and I had the swelling and severe bruising to prove it. After our ceremony and wedding day (which was all really great) we got in the car to drive to the hotel that we were staying in that night. We stopped at a drive through to buy food and I have no idea what I said to him that set him off (this is true 90% of the time) but he was really mad at me when we got there. He refused to speak to me and I had to beg him to help me get my dress off and had to beg him to be gentle because it?s my wedding dress and I was very badly hurt. He refused to speak to me, said some mean things to me while I cried and begged him to just take care of me, asked him why he made vows to me that day if he was going to treat me like this, that I didn?t understand why he was mad, can we talk, and he just refused and passed out on the couch. I could barely walk at this point and I was in excruciating pain. I still get upset thinking about this day, he ruined it. One time I brought up (I think in therapy) that he acted like that on our wedding day and he just lost it. I?m not allowed to say he was hurtful bc it was actually me who was hurtful. So I carry that with me and I never even got an apology. 

2. Recently, I was having sharp pain right above my ear and it was killing me. He was rubbing my head and around my ear and it was helping and it was really sweet. Then he put his finger in my ear (my ears are extremely sensitive, this is something I expect him to know about me). It created a seal in my ear and it hurt. I told him that it hurt me and he started laughing. I said this isn?t funny to me I didn?t like it. He acted like he was going to do it again and kept laughing and I moved away from him and told him it hurt me and I?m not laughing, I didn?t like it. He told me he ?didn?t? stick his finger in my ear and I?m just blowing it out of proportion and suddenly he has to go to bed so he gets up, turns off the light, and leaves. I am sitting there in shock like what? You hurt me, I told you it hurt, you laughed at me and then got mad and me and left me alone in the dark because I said you couldn?t do that more? Really? Then he came back out to tell me again that he didn?t put his finger in his ear and it wasn?t rude of him to turn off the light, walk away, and ignore me and my boundaries and I?m overreacting. Then he texts me hours later that he?s sorry, he should have just said sorry for putting his finger in my ear. Ok. Then a couple weeks later he?s touching my arm and he says ?is that ok? I know I have to be careful now how I touch you because apparently you don?t like the way I touch you? and I?m just fucking flabbergasted. Really? I don?t want your FINGER IN MY EAR and it?s too much to ask you to respect my boundaries that now you just can?t touch me? He then goes on to explain how he massages my feet and my hands and all of that goes down the drain because he put his finger in my ear. I don?t even know what that means. But we fought again because he actually wasn?t sorry about sticking his finger in my ear and it doesn?t matter that it hurt me, it hurt his feelings more that I told him not to do it. 

3. He never asks me about my past or is interested when I talk about things. A show that brought up a ton of childhood (good) memories made me want to show him a scrapbook I made as a teenager. This is also one of the only things from my past that I have because I lost everything in a fire and I am no contact with my family. He literally said to me that he doesn?t care and he doesn?t know why I want to talk about the past. He genuinely does not give a fuck to learn about me in depth as a person, what I like and want and need. It doesn?t matter to him. Cool cool cool. I tell him this is how I feel he tells me I?m ?gaslighting him? ( a term he learned from me when u point out him gaslighting me) or that I?m abusive because I am not respecting his needs (also what he learned from me) super fun. 

4. I had a fever of over 103 and I said something he didn?t like I guess and he again ignored me and refused to acknowledge me. I ended up having pneumonia but that night with the high fever I didn?t know what to do because I couldn?t think straight. He abandoned me when I was majorly sick and refused to help me at all. I couldn?t move from my bed so I didn?t really eat or drink for the two days he was mad at me. I barely had strength to brush my teeth. In hindsight I should have gone straight to ER but the one time he took me (after the major fall before our wedding)  he made me feel so uncomfortable by complaining the whole time and acting like I was overreacting and didn?t need to be there wasting his time. He acted similarly while waiting in the hospital to have our baby, and after the baby was born. It makes me feel like my health isn?t important to him at all, his time and his ego are more important. 

5. He went to go get lunch while our son naps. He came in and I said ?hi? and he ignored me and walked past me. I said ?here I?m moving the table you can put it here? and he puts the food across the room and walks away. Then he comes back in (I?ve already stood up and gotten the food) and I said ?are you ok? and he was snappy like wtf why am I asking him that and he said no and he doesn?t know why I?m asking him that when he obviously fine. And I said well you?re not obviously fine, I told you I was moving the table and you put the food over there and walked away. And he FLIPPED OUT and said that the table had a blanket on it (I was moving it and cleaning up so he can put the food there) so he put it across the room and went to change and now I?m attacking him. Then he grabbed his food and left with it and said ?I guess there is a problem now? um.... ok? 

6. In a nutshell he just can?t commit to learn what I need, and stop doing the things that hurt me. He acts like I?m asking too much and i know I?m not. I think he?s gaslighting me but I don?t get his agenda. I?m a catch. I have a high level of education (a MA, he has a HS diploma), a good career, I don?t play games, I?m straight forward, I?m honest, I communicate, I?m reflective.... I?m also attractive and funny and witty and he makes me feel like I am none of these things. He makes me feel like I?m a horrible person who just nags him all the time and doesn?t appreciate anything and most importantly (and most loudly) that he doesn?t love me and I?m not worthy of love. I tell him EXACTLY what would make me feel the things I need to feel and he actively refuses to do those things or even remember what the things are I need. 
I don?t know what to do. Yes, when I read this all (and this isn?t even everything) I think ?if my friend said all of this to me I would say LEAVE? and here I am like waaaaa what do I do?! I know that he doesn?t have the emotional maturity to do any of the options that I think will work. He?s going to want to leave the house OR he will stay and just be a horror to be around. Whatever we plan to do I want life at home to be as normal as possible for my son. I don?t hate him, I just can?t get what I need from him. I?m happy to keep our surface level relationship if I can get what I need from someone else. I honestly think it would take the pressure off our relationship bc I won?t be pinning all of my needs on him. All I know is I am unhappy and I can?t maintain this forever. I don?t want to go get what I need behind his back either. 

These are just a few scenarios to highlight the above issues. These kinds of things happen every day and it?s so petty and I?m so over. And I?m especially over being told that it?s me who is the problem. 

I do want to say that he is great in every other way. He is helpful around the house and with the baby, he takes care of our house, he cooks and cleans, etc. he is a good guy. He?s just emotionally stunted.

44,,10,c76wos,1,"After being recently married, I've found out some things about my SO past that I'm not sure I can forgive after being together for 15 years. I wish she wouldve have told me long ago to have prevented so much pain but it's too late. We dont have kids but we had our lives planned together and I thought we were soulmates. 

After some time I've struggled to feel the same toward her as I used to, and even though that breaks me it breaks me to know my life and relationships isnt what I thought it always was. 

Recently a person came into my life in the midst of the avalanche and although feeling guilty. I started feeling something toward. She makes me feel warm..but shes also a friend that I respect greatly. I wouldnt want to ruin that.

It's too early to decide what I feel but I cant help but realize she makes me feel something. Now I'm just confused and wonder if things will ever be the same with my SO. At this point have I emotionally cheated? Maybe, maybe not.

Either way..this person that has made me feel just a bit of butterflies recently and also happens to be attracted to me. Not to say she wants me like cdazy..but theres some tension there.

Dont know what I should do in my position but..maybe one of you has found yourself in this position before. What do you think?

Edit: I guess Its important to mention this new person is also extremely compatible to me. We have similar sense of humor, similar energy, same mindset in some key things in life, and altogether I feel guilty saying but I would totally see myself with her if I were single without a doubt.

We dated before and things got toxic very quickly. We were both younger and not sober so we split on bad terms and spent three years without even speaking to one another. We both grew up and found our way back and I couldn't be happier with my decision to try again. He is my best friend and truly my other half. But, every adult in my life has been disloyal to one another to the point that it has been the norm from the time I was a small child. I fervently hate cheaters. My mother cheated and left my adopted father and me. He subsequently shot himself in front of me at age 14 so I really mean it when I say I hate cheaters. I have access to his phone and all his social media as he does mine. I trust him. I know he is not doing anything and I know he would not do anything to hurt me. But due to our past and my family history I have an intense fear of infidelity to the point that other women on his social media make me ridiculously uncomfortable. I feel like a crazy person and I dont want to tell him my fears and insecurities in this regard for fear he would think i dont trust him. Really, I do.

46,,5,c76mdk,1,"My wife and I got married about a year ago, in October 2018. We've moved since then and we are still very much in love. The problem is that I've noticed that we don't seem to do much together anymore. Be it something mundane like watch TV, play a game, or something sexual in nature.

&#x200B;

Plans usually get made when I bring something up but they never seem to fall in line. She doesn't really recommend to do anything usually but we go over to a friends house and watch something there. That's about all we do it seems. I've talked to her about how I feel like we don't seem to spend much time together anymore and it causes the moment of: ""Well let's do a thing. What do you want to do?"" Plans get made to play something and we kinda get setup to play a game and we just don't. Neither of us are super social people but it only seems that we hang out when other people are involved. Be it family or mutual friends.

&#x200B;

Same thing happens for something sexual. There are things that aren't good that have happened in our past that do affect how things of a sexual nature occur. Oral sex happens from time to time before bed. 1-3 times a week usually. I'm a gentleman, it's not just me getting blown. However anything more than that hasn't happened since we got married. It's one of the things that made me want to type this up in the first place. It's another thing that gets talked about but doesn't really seem to change things, mostly just makes her upset and that's not fun.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I love my wife to death, but being alone together is starting to get boring. It almost feels like we're friends that just happen to share a bed and house. Things weren't like this until recently and they are getting worse.

52,,6,c75ddz,3,"I am feeling so confused, sad, just lost...

My husband and I have been together for 12 years, married for 10. We have an 8 year old. 

We have had many ups and downs just like any marriage but the past year has felt like one big ?down? period. 

To start my husband has (in my opinion) issues controlling his anger. He gets upset about what I think is the smallest things and at times feels like I am walking on eggshells just trying not to set him off. He frequently gets upset with our son and as a result they don?t have the best relationship. He is on medication for depression and anxiety and checks up regularly with his psychiatrist. I have considered leaving in the past due to these periods just being unbearable. I have told him this. 

We have fought before and considered splitting up when our son was younger but always managed to work through our issues. I am not sure if we can do it this time around. 

Last year I discovered that my husband had several different online accounts that he used for sexting other men and women. He had been doing this for about 2 years and possibly longer. 

I confronted him and told him I was done. I was so upset - I spent so much time being rejected sexually because he was ?too tired? or whatever excuse he would give at the time ..but not too tired to hop online and have phone sex with a stranger. 

I had kicked him out of the house (The house, cars, etc are all in my name. I had been the primary breadwinner for years.) and he begged to reconcile. Although now that I think back it feels like he was more concerned about seeing our son less and the idea of paying child support than wanting to be with me. 

A few days into our split my grandpa passed away unexpectedly and my husband was there for me which started our reconciliation. I think at the time I just wasn?t ready to let go. He is the only person I have ever been with. We started dating just before I turned 19. 

Since the discovery of his cheating we have had total transparency since then - he used to be so secretive with his phone - but it has still been so hard to regain that trust back. I still have periods when I sit and wonder if he is just sneakier about it now. Anytime he suggests me and my son go do an activity and he stays home my mind just wonders. I have tried talking to him about how I feel before but was always met with ?If you don?t trust me don?t be with me.? I didn?t do anything wrong. I wasn?t the one going behind his back with other people. 

I just feel like I never got answers.  When I asked him why he did it last year all he could tell me was that he did it because he was ?bored?. He is the type to want to just brush problems under the rug and not deal with it. I don?t think I will ever get the reason why behind it all. 

Within the past few months our issue has now become about my job. I am a night-shift nurse who used to work at a horrible hospital and dreaded going to work everyday. My stress levels were 20/10 and I never felt like I could relax even on my days off. After two years of hell I got hired at a new hospital and I LOVE my job. I never leave in a bad mood and don?t dread going into work. The problem is that we are over staffed so once a week we are all getting called off and put on call for the shift. Financially it has been a $400/month pay cut. However my husband was just promoted at work and is now bringing home an additional $600-$800 a month depending on his hours. 

From what he is telling me it all boils down to him wanting me to work equal hours. If I work two shifts a week I am getting 24 hrs/week. He works 40-50. So I have made an effort since I am working less to do more domestic duties around the house - cooking each night, trying to keep the house clean. He comes home each night (and really this hasn?t changed since I was working full time.) takes a 2 hour nap and then plays video games until 10-11pm. I feel like why should our working hours be equal if I am still expected to be the one who managed the house also? As far as household duties all I have ever asked from him is to take out the trash and cut the grass. I will say too that even when I worked full time he would make little comments like ?Must be nice to only work 3 days a week.? Not in a supportive way but sarcastically. 

The work issue has become a once a week fight. I have tried explaining to him that I can?t demand to come in to work if we are over staffed. I have even tried asking my boss to let me come in as support but that was a no-go. 

He wants me to quit. I don?t want to give up this job. It is SO HARD to find a nursing job in this area that doesn?t suck. He wants me to get a second job and I could understand if we were really hurting for money or couldn?t pay our bills but our bills are paid, we have food in the fridge, and an extra $500 left over until he gets paid again this Friday. I have created a budget. I feel like I am trying to make this work. 

I feel like we can?t compromise on this. He said yesterday if we continue to fight over this issue he will consider divorce. What I hear is ?money is more important to me than your happiness and if you don?t do what I want I am leaving.?

I feel like I am in a lose-lose situation here. I give up the job I love to find another job which could be the same or worse or pick up a second job and lose out on family time or my husband leaves me. Last night he said he is finally in a place financially where he could leave if he wanted and be OK. Before this he was working 30 hours a week bringing home maybe $1200/month. Now he?s bringing home around $2000-$2500 monthly. Now I wonder did he stick around out of financial insecurity? 

I have suggested counseling but he doesn?t seem open to the idea. He came home from work and would barely talk or look at me. He said he is ?irritated? with me regarding everything. I don?t know what to do. 
I guess this was the final straw.

I live in Georgia she lives in Arizona, we're basically friends with benefits I have strong feelings for her & she has had strong feelings for me. Today she told wants to be just wants to be friends and her feelings right now are just friends. She also said she doesn't want to be anyone 7 years or younger or her age that she could grow with. She did say she cares about me. I told her my feelings & I also told her I hope our friendship is still the same meaning (sex) even though I didn't say the sex word, but that would mean our friendship is still the same as far as friends with benefits & she said she cherish our friendship & cares about me after I said that. I've also told her I would like to move to AZ next year, I don't want to move all because of her but she's a big part of it, I just love AZ in general.

I have some questions:

54,,1,c75ie1,2,"My boyfriend is trying to quit vaping. I think that the last time he vaped was one week ago. Right now he?s working on using gums to get over it.

I notice he?s become very passive aggressive with me, and sometimes snaps too when I say things that normally wouldn?t make someone angry (like we were at the store looking for ingredients, and he pointed somewhere on the shelf and asked me what something was?I asked him what item he was pointing to just to make sure and he gave me a heavy sigh, whipped in front of me and grabbed it aggressively). He told me yesterday, ?If I snap at you, it?s just because I?m getting off of nicotine.? But he never apologized. It makes me really sad.

I have experience with an abusive relationship that lasted for 2 years and his behavior is mirroring the same of my ex boyfriend and it really hurts my feelings?it?s not a feeling I want to experience ever again, which is why it?s so important to me.

63,,1,c74hf6,1,"My ex and I were living in different states when we started talking and decided to get back together. We missed each other and he told me he was single and wanted to be my boyfriend. He said was uncertain how things could be between us but that he wanted to try again. I know he had a girlfriend before this but he told me they were broken up. I was suspicious but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he seemed sincerely sorry about his past behavior (lots of lying ...).

After a month of taking only online and doing webcam stuff (no in person contact)  he moved over to be with me. I noticed his ex blowing up his phone with texts with inane info about her life it just seemed too close for comfort. Because he had been a liar the past I took her number from the phone and called her

Turns out he hadn?t stopped being with her the entire month we were talking and she didn?t know about me. She was hurt. I was in an intense rage. I checked in with him hundreds of times to make sure he was single and each time he acted like I was insane and paranoid and was like ?yeah of course... I told you we are just friends... I need you to be chill and no drama...?

On the other hand he DID move to be with me... and said he wants to marry me and be in a serious relationship with me. Said he was just trying not to alienate the girl & he wasn?t sure if stuff with me would work out so he didn?t break up with her until he was physically leaving 

His justification is that we were not physically together when it happened and he wasn?t sure about me until we actually met up. In my mind this is almost kind of legit? I don?t know... I?m still super hurt and angry because during that month we agreed to be monogamous with each other... he said he didn?t realize what he was doing at the time....said it was hard cause he was already with that girl and they had the same friend circle & she was basically his best friend at that point, but he was in love with me 

He seems legitimately remorseful & not meaning ill but I don?t know if that counts for anything

65,,20,c778r9,3,"So, I caught him cheating about 8-9 months ago and I didn?t forgive him. I clearly didn?t forget it either because I always bring it up to him. I stayed around in hopes that he would show extreme remorse and try to win my trust back and he hasn?t even tried. He blames me for him cheating. He said I left him alone and he was lonely (we had a fight where I wouldn?t talk to him for like 2 days). 

I truly feel he isn?t even attracted to me. As mentioned in a previous post, he won?t even post a single picture of me on his IG or FB even though he?s posted past female friends and girlfriends and KEPT those photos up even when he got into a relationship with me.  I?ve caught him looking at other women on his phone (not porn) but just women posing all sultry in sexy clothes. One time on our way to my parents home for the holidays this past Christmas, he pulled out his phone to input something into his gps app and as soon as he unlocked his phone, a picture of a woman was on his phone. It wasn?t IG. He quickly closed his phone when he saw I saw it and he refused to show me. But I believe he received the pic from someone via text or he was looking at it from Telegram or WhatsApp. 

Another time way before the above incident, we were FaceTiming and I asked him to show me his room. So he flipped the camera. As he did this, he forgot his laptop was open in front of him. And I saw a picture of a woman in underwear and a bra. He quickly brought it down and said it was instagram. Who the fuck scrolls through Instagram on their desktop?

I bring these things up because I don?t look like those women. I don?t have long thick black hair. I don?t have big breasts. And I certainly don?t dress like a girl from jersey shore circa 2005. I?m 5?3? and am about 145lbs. I have brown hair. I have my lips done. I have a decent butt. It?s not huge, but it?s certainly not little. I dress decent. I don?t wear coochie shorts and 5 inch heels. I?m in law school. I wear leggings most of the time and laid back clothes. But on occasion, I?ll dress up in a cute outfit and heels. 

I already brought it up to him and he?s saying he?s doing it to punish me. He said that I fight with him a lot, and as a result, he?s unable to achieve the things he wants to achieve like going out of the country to see his cousin who has cancer. Also, he said he can?t even visit his friend in LA because I fight a lot with him. He said he?s afraid I?ll fight with him while he?s away. 

Maybe I wouldn?t fight if he took accountability for cheating on me and apologized and actually made an effort to win my trust back. Also, he?s NEVER taken me anywhere. He goes with his friends to bars and to restaurants all the time and he?s taken me out maybe twice.


I am very insecure. I truly believe he intentionally used his narcissistic tactics to build me up and win me over when we first started dating, then he intentionally used his emotional power over me to destroy my self-esteem just so he could maintain control while he gets to do what he wants (whilst controlling me from doing what I want) 

I am so insecure right now. I feel ugly as fuck. I feel unhappy and depressed.

66,,14,c736y1,6,"TL;DR: After my friend came out to me, we 've been fooling around and making out together and now I begin to have doubts about my sexuality.

He's my best friend and I've known him for 4 years. We've been doing what normal teenagers would do: Drinking beers together, talking about girls and how some girls look attractive...

Three weeks ago, he came out to me and I was quite surprised because I hadn't a shade of doubt about him being gay. Right after that he kissed me and things escalated quickly, we started making out (I've always had a desire to experiment with guys) and we kept fooling around without penetration nor B.J until the day when we had a fight. He asked if we were a couple and I told him that he's my best friend. He got mad and hurled at me by being coward and not brave enough to accept myself as a gay person. The thing is I've never felt an extreme desire for him nor for gay sex. I've always preferred girls and I had a fantastic pleasure making love to my GF when we were still together, but I was totally okay making out with my male friend.

After that fight, I've been always thinking about the things he said. I've always been into girls and never had a sexual attraction to a male. But I can't deny that I enjoyed making out with him, but I can't imagine myself getting penetrated or penetrate someone else's ass.",My friend (20M) came out to me (20M).

67,,5,c75ike,1,"We are 15 months into our relationship. On the 1 year day we got engaged, and planning to get married next May. We love each other and we are a great match.

Since the beginning we have had an intense relationship. I'm more analytical, and she is more emotional and chaotic. She is also very religious and proper, so I've had to go along with a lot in that department coming from a more scientific background. We, and in particular she has had a very tough year. She has had to go many times to her home country to take care of her mother who is mentally ill and also has a heart disease, together with her grandfather dying.

We've also had tremendous problems with her ex, who . she when we got together had not let go off in some strange way. They still had a house together, a dog together, she still had a room there, and this was 2 years after they broke up. For a while I insisted on them having no contact, something I gave up because I don't really have the moral high ground here since I am cofounders with my own ex, which is very upsetting to my fiance.

So a tough backdrop, but here starts the very unusual activities of late.

Lately their contact has been going up a lot, she she has been sending him many things and talk to him more than before, like multiple times per week. That's kind of in line with previous, but an uptick nonetheless.

She also arranged this very important conference, and took to inviting like every guy she had previously dated. This is sort of her personality to just go all-out when something needs to be done for other people, but I found this out of line. She also set this one guy who she had sort of dated right before me as the conferencier.

Yesterday we had a big blowup as she was showing me some guys at work who had sent her flirty emails. And out of the blue she replies to one of them while we're sitting there with a flirty email. I first took a long time to clarify what just happened or whether it was a joke, as she was in a very goofy mood at that point. But she really blew me off. So eventually I blew off and said that then she can leave the house. She eventually gave an apology that was acceptable. But at this point she is so angry that I got angry and told her to leave that she leaves the house.

I try my best to reconcile and she does come back the same night.

Anyhow, today a friend of hers visits. And they go out to a guy my fiance wanted to intro her to. Later we talk about it and it comes up, this isn't really a friend of hers. But a guy she had dated 5 years ago who had then dumped her, but now reached back out to say he was single. She had said she was not engaged, but arranged to meet him to supposedly talk about some work stuff and brought her friend.

I am once again quite flabbergasted. Up until a month ago, she had been the kind of person you just \*know\* she could never even do something slightly borderline in the unfaithful department. And not there has been a barrage of things that I find borderline in less than a month.

I understand she is very distressed these days. We just bought a house, we postpone the marriage (due to mothers illness) and mothers illness is not sorted yet. And all of that has also caused many more upsets in our relationship.

So, I don't quite know how to read this. And I don't quite know how ""charitable"" to read it. She is obviously in perhaps the most difficult time of her life. But I don't understand her motivation.

Later, since it was the last night, the older girls and guys were allowed to hang out in the grassy area between the girls and guys lodges. We laid in the grass, looked at the stars (rural WV), and talked from 12:45 to 4:30am. At this camp, once you graduate high school, you can't be a camper anymore. I just graduated, so this was my last night ever as a camper. Before we went in, this exchange happened:

Me: Is it obvious that I like you? (One of her friends told me they were talking about some stuff that I did for her. I thought I was being sneaky about it haha)

Her: Yeah. It really is haha

Me: Seriously? Is the feeling mutual at all? 

Her: I mean, yeah, duh

We didn't kiss or anything because we were both cold and really tired. We just hugged and went to sleep in our separate lodges. 

It's a tradition at the camp to go the the local Dairy Queen right after leaving camp, so we decided to meet there. We hung out, and I got her Snapchat. When I was getting ready to leave, she gave me this massive (well, as massive as a 4'11"" girl can manage) bear hug, looked up at me and said:

72,,71,c70w2n,37,"My husband is now almost 30. We have been happily married for 3 years. He is very kind, loving, and extremely conscientious. I have never had cause to regret our marriage or question his love and faithfulness. I love him so much!

But recently my husband confessed the horrible act he did to his brother and step brother when he was in middle school. I don't know how to feel about this, and my husband wants answers to what he should do.

A bit of a backstory - from the age of five, my husband was raised by his grandparents as an only child. His mother was 17 or 18 and unmarried. Furthermore, she was a neglectful parent, to say the least. I understand his grandparents took him out of a very bad situation. I don't know particulars, and my husband says he doesn't remember much from that time.

However, my husband has a brother and a step brother, several years younger. His mother raised his siblings, and my husband said that his relationship with them growing up was more like distant cousins than actual siblings.

When the act happened, his brothers were 10 and 6, and my husband was 13. He was very sexually confused. His grandparents never talked about the subject. Friends at school introduced him to pornography. He was curious and looking for an outlet. He would spend a weekend occasionally with his brothers and that's when this happened.

My husband will not go into graphic detail, but it seems to be that he masturbated with his brothers and showed them how. He says he did touch them \*there\*. He recalls that he knew it was wrong and sinful, but his brothers seemed curious as well. He says they looked guilty afterwards, just as he felt guilty.

This was the only time he did such an act. He still sees his brothers about once or twice or year, and nothing is ever brought up. They talk with him like they talk with all their relatives. They aren't close, but I have never viewed any tension.

My husband has never told anyone. As far as he knows, neither have his brothers. But I husband's deep worry is that he hurt them. Their lives have been so unstable. He wonders if he should talk with them, and ask their forgiveness. But also, he does not want to rip open an old wound or bring up something that they have repressed. What should he do?

Also, we both worry that there may be legal consequences if this is ever brought to light. *Is my husband a sex offender?* He has absolutely no predatory tendencies or urges, pedophiliac or otherwise. He looks back on this single instance from years ago with shame and disgust, and does not want to make excuses for it. But he also doesn't want to be put on a registry or go to prison. This would bring us financial ruin (we struggle as it is), to say nothing of reputation and hurt to others we love.

73,,2,c76q2k,3,"Here I am, it?s now been 33 days since I last spoke to my ex-girlfriend and 52 days since the break-up. I have made all the steps towards recovery (continuing with school, going back to the gym consistently, spending time with friends) but my mind keeps going over my situation day in and day out. I tried therapy, but my schedule right now is too hectic to match up with any days for more than one appointment.

I am having a really hard time comprehending what happened and I need advice/help. We had been together for the past two years and known each other since about November of 2016. She initially pursued me first and we hit it off really quick. I became a part of her family (spending days at a time over there, and holidays) and spent a lot of my time with her despite living an hour away. I worked, went to school and balanced her well. I know that I did mean a lot to her, and we were very attached. She didn?t have too many friends, and neither did I. Plenty of friends came and went with her, and I felt like I really helped her through a lot of things that went on in her life. I do believe I was a super positive addition to her life, and she was with mine. In many ways, we both grew together and closer to each other since the very beginning after being physically and emotionally intimate for so long.

It changed this year when I faced the hardest semester of my life, after getting into a medical program. She asked for a break, because she knew this program would consume my life and wanted to avoid getting into issues over it. I never was okay with the decision, and so I refused for a long time. Eventually, we broke up in April because she told me I was too distant and too busy for a girlfriend. She claimed she ?love me, but was not in love with me.? It stung, but after our two hour phone call I let her go and moved on. Within a week, she was calling me drunk, calling me after a minor fender bender she had, texting me angrily because she was mad that I wasn?t reaching out. Eventually we made up, and she explained that she had been stalking me every day and crying because she missed me so much. She wrote little poems about how much she missed me, and I definitely missed her too. After some talking, we got back together but I did warn her that finals were only four weeks away.

A month later, I became more distant and it began hard to balance her with everything else even more. For the duration of the semester I was working 24 hours a week, going to class for 30 and then trying to see her for at least 1-2 days a week in between studying so much. I was getting 6 hours of sleep and I was very busy. I could feel the space between us, because I would often forget to call her back, or forget to message back. Eventually she broke up with me again, over the phone. She told me nothing I would say could fix the situation, and she couldn?t handle it anymore. I was really mad at her and acted a bit cold on the phone, but I needed to stay centered because my most important finals were the very next day. I removed her off social media, like I did with the first break up and moved on with studying.

Two weeks later, into NC a friend showed me screenshots of her social media. I figured out I was actually blocked from her Twitter and Instagram. In the screenshot, I saw her getting kissed on the cheek by another guy and she tagged him in the photo. In another one, she took a picture of him in a hotel room (something we used to do a lot) and printed it with her sprocket she had bought with me three weeks before. I was devastated and tried calling her. She never answered. Instead, hours later she left a cold voicemail in a voice I had never heard from her asking why I was calling because she felt ?done with me? and wasn?t sure why I needed to call her. I waited another two weeks to let the dust settle, and then tried calling one last time. She picked up, and I apologized for how I treated her towards the end of the relationship. She told me she could only see us as friends at this point on and that we would never date again. I reminded her that I was not down for friendship, and she began crying. She reminded me how I helped her with so much, and I let her know that I saw the photos through a friend. She didn?t confirm nor deny anything. I told her I needed space to move on and told her I wouldn?t be contacting her again for any reason. I told her if she ever changed her mind, that she knew where to find me. I still loved her. I hung up the phone after 20 minutes of talking to her.

Later on, I made the mistake of checking her social media again and saw that she already brought him to her house and was posting about him a lot. On his instagram, he had a picture of her with 13 like saying they're ""OFFICIALLY getting married, because the fireworks went off when we first kissed. Forever with my babe from here to eternity."" This was posted two weeks after our break up. Their relationship is moving super fast. She went from still tweeting about me before the breakup, to posting pictures of him playing our old battleship game and seemingly having the time of her life with this guy. She had posted me in the past, but never like this. It made me feel like she never really cared about me at this point. I stopped checking her social media.

Here I am, 33 days into no contact and I miss her brutally. I won?t be breaking no contact, but I still deeply want her back. I?m starting to lose hope that she will reach out to me, but I really want her to. I just don?t understand how I could go from being so important to her to meaning nothing. I never cheated, lied or abused her. I never was controlling, jealous or needy. I felt like a lot of what I was doing was right up until the end. I really loved her and I don?t want to let go subconsciously. I still dream about her and think about her day in and day out.","Will I ever hear from her again? [M21, F26]",0.81
74,,15,c74hns,0,"I've been with Girl A for 8 years. Not as attractive as she used to be, I don't want to have sex with her very often anymore and haven't for a while. But she is a great girlfriend/companion, does the little and big things for me. That said, she was no angel before I met her, she had an affair while she was married and got pregnant during that affair, etc. She does not have a child though. This was a concern for me in the beginning of the relationship but she has been a great companion/girlfriend and after the first 2 years of the relationship no trust issues.

&#x200B;

I'm sad to say I tried to split up a few times but she refused to leave and we just settled back into the routine. I eventually stepped out on her a few years into the relationship but never long term and nothing serious...until I met Girl B. Girl B has been divorced about 3-4 times and her work history isn't great. Has a teenage daughter from a deadbeat dad that her parents take care of now. We've been together 8 months and she knows about Girl A. She was recently out of state visiting her parents but came back to see me recently so we could talk face to face about what we want moving forward and spend time together. We've been through the stage of learning each others boundaries and we talked about some of my concerns for her like holding down a job which she has had trouble with in the past and house work, etc. We are on the same page there now.

&#x200B;

That said trust is a big issue with me. She is worried about me too, especially the way we met and what we are doing, but she is just weird and flakey sometimes. Her story has always checked out 100% legit no matter how bizarre. I had similar worries with Girl A in the first couple years too but they faded over time, she was always where she said she was, etc. With Girl B she acts weird and suspicious sometimes but when I check into it it turns out her story is legit even though she responds weird when I ask her and makes things even more suspicious. The distance hasn't helped since she's been gone for a few months and just recently came to visit.

&#x200B;

Girl B gave me 4-6 weeks to decide what I wanted to do and said if I want to just be friends for now until I know what I want that's fine too as she is not going anywhere or looking for anyone else. She said that she thinks I'm going to choose to stay with Girl A and that although that will suck she thinks that will be what happens and said there will be no hard feelings, even though she knows I don't want to stay friends if we ever split she said she hopes she can at least drop me an email and check in on me once in a while. In any case, so now I have a few weeks to choose Girl A or B. My only concerns with Girl B at this point are:

&#x200B;

\-Trust, will there always be weird stuff or will this fade? Is this a red flag or? I will say as weird as some of the stuff was it checked out. She's promised no more weird stuff and is pretty accommodating when I have concerns, as I am with her. As in she'll send me proof to ease my concern about whatever the situation is and I do the same for her. The stuff seems odd to me though. Changing story, weird answers, but they have always checked out. Example below under heading ""Example"".

&#x200B;

\-I wonder if I'll compare Girl B to Girl A all the time when she doesn't do the little things. But Girl A built up to that over time and some tell me that Girl B will become Girl A over time.

&#x200B;

\-I worry that I'm making a mistake, letting a great woman that I may not be in love with anymore and am not really attracted to anymore but yet is a great life partner go for someone that seems risky to me. Some tell me after 8 years together that it's likely we could get back together if things don't work out with Girl B. Also, I feel bad about letting go of someone who has been a great friend for 8 years.

&#x200B;

Either way it's going to suck, there is no easy choice here, I am going to hurt one or the other and I'm taking a risk and it's going to be hard to let go of one or the other. So what to do and how to choose?

Example

&#x200B;

 

On her birthday before we became a couple she tried to cancel our date for her birthday because of a legal appointment. I thought she was ditching me for another guy she was dating. Turns out the legal appointment was legit...but she skipped it. Her mom verified it, said it's not the first time. She stopped by a long time friends place and her work where she takes care of a paraplegic. I thought she was lying, but it turns out she did have an appointment and skipped it, and that guy really was just her friend. I talked to the guy (with her knowledge) without him knowing who I was and pretended I was a family member and that I hadn't heard from her and asked if they were romantically involved, if she had a boyfriend, etc. He told me they were just friends, but that she was dating someone, a guy who she met online, and described me in the rest of the conversation citing that if she's with him (me) that he's sure she is fine. She had told me that she had told him about me and asked his advice about us because 3 months in she really liked me but wasn't sure what we were and wasn't sure what to do.

77,,6,c73ijz,19,"So, I will start off with a little backstory. Thirteen years ago my father started his own business. He hired a manager familiar with the field. This manager and his family moved to my small town. He has three boys, the middle one was my age, we'll call him Dustin. I immediately became close friends with Dustin and we were best friends throughout highschool.

Two years ago Dustin moved in with me. He got up one morning having issues breathing and drove himself to the hospital. Dustin didn't make it back home. He was nineteen years old and died of a blood clot. It took me a long time to get through it. Most of me getting through it was being closer friends with his brothers. Dustin's younger brother we will call Zach. Zach and I were already friends before that, but losing Dustin made us get way closer. 

Fast forward to this April... Zach came by my work one day to talk and eat his breakfast. I should mention that my mother and I run a used car lot in our town. Zach left after eating his breakfast to go home which was about three minutes away.  Zach didn't make it home. He died in a car accident at eighteen years old. So now I'm getting close to their oldest brother, but back to the relationship advice I need.

So, it's been a tough couple of months, facing my own mortality, but I am getting out of the depression. This is where my co-working mom comes into play. Every day she mentions one of my deceased friends multiple times. I've tried to just deal with it because I know that talking and crying about the deceased makes her feel better. But it does the opposite to me. 

Today, I decided I had enough of it. I kind of snapped and said ""I am really trying to get over Dustin and Zach, but I am fucking tired of having to be upset about them multiple times a day."" This shut her down immediately and I feel so bad.

Just now I literally just stepped in the door to our house after being out for a full day. He tries to talk about how I need to let my 5 year old son watch more tv. I ask him if we can have this conversation after the kid is asleep, he says ""no, it will take 5 minutes"" which these conversations never do.

He constantly approaches me either at 12am when I'm trying to go to sleep or when my hands are full with something else, and wont listen when I ask if we could talk about whatever matter at a later time. The few times we do talk, the conversation will go on for an hour and a half plus and he gets frustrated when  I ask if we could approach this some other time.

These conversations are very draining and nothing ever gets resolved, but whenever he has an issue he always demands I talk to him whenever it's on his mind, without any care as to if it's a good time to talk.

He's into anal, blowjobs, furry, hentai, and shemale porn. The only one that bothers me is the shemale stuff. I don't have a penis, so I'm disturbed that he likes masturbating to it. (That was all addressed in a previous post).

So, he masturbates every day at least twice a day. We have sex maybe once every 2 to 3 weeks. We used to have sex almost everyday. I noticed a change when he cheated on me (with a girl, which was 2 years ago). He didn't touch me the same. Our sex has always been vanilla. I try to switch things up with new positions, toys, and foreplay. He prefers skipping foreplay and getting straight to it. After he finishes, he turns away from me to sleep. He usually doesn't ask if I would like to get off (I have to use my magic wand, or I can't orgasm). I masturbate like once a month lol. Maybe he's not attracted to me. I have always been fat. Haven't gained weight since we've been together, but maybe he isn't into me anymore. Or maybe he sees sex as a bad thing after cheating. Or he's addicted to porn and masturbation. 

Maybe he's gay. In the last post, people asked me to introduce a strap on. My bf is completely against this. I'm just hella confused. I feel...unattractive. I find myself missing being wanted.

80,,1,c74uqo,1,"hey guys

&#x200B;

i have a tiny bit of a dilemma and i need advice on what should i do

&#x200B;

basically i'm a girl with nearly zero experience in the romantic field. I've always been the one to help my friends with their relationships, I was the perfect shipper, always knowing who should they pick and how to get the one their heart desires. I, on the other hand, am the one who may be destined to be forever alone. I was growing up under so-called helicopter parenting, so I started going out (and taking care of my appearance) only just after I started studying at the uni, when I was 19 yrs old. Before that, I was an anon lurking on 4chan and related sites, not going out at all, except for school. So, I didn't really have any opportunities to get experiences in relationships. Especially since I had a trauma from my primary school. I was really ugly back then and boys were making fun of me, my clothes, my acne, even my grades, since I have always been a good student (and still am). So, I hadn't been talking to any boys until I was like 18 or sth. I have never kissed a boy or even held one by the hand. Friendly hugs are probably the closest I have ever gotten to a male.

&#x200B;

Well, that was one lengthy introduction. Sorry for that, but I feel like writing some kind of background will help with understanding my way of thinking and complete inexperience. And such.

&#x200B;

**And with that, the actual description of the situation I am in starts.**

&#x200B;

Anyway, as I got to uni, I got a major crush. And I mean like, **major** crush. I starting taking care of myself on all fields, both appearance-wise and character-wise. Right now I can say that I may not be the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood, but I'm definitely one of the prettier ones, provided that I wear makeup n shit - cause my acne has mostly diminished, but some of it left some hyperpigmentation that I have to cover.

&#x200B;

First thing I did was trying to get to know my crush better. I'm pretty energetic and definitely not one to just stand and observe from the distance, even though I am quite socially awkward and shy when it comes to boys. It was hard. He is not a person to open up easily (or to open up at all) and I suspect that he may have some past relationship-related trauma, although he most certainly hasn't been in a relationship. It took two years, but now we are pretty close as friends. I tell him all my problems and he's a really good listener and wants to help however he can, even though he's really bad at talking. He doesn't talk to me about his issues though. He sometimes mentions stuff, which is actually a lot for him - as far as I know, he doesn't have a best friend kind of person so I guess the scraps that he's telling me may be the maximum for him.

&#x200B;

As for his feelings for me, I'm not exactly sure. I usually can read people quite easily, but this guy is like an enigma. Recently I got some kind of feeling he may be starting to like me too, as finally I'm not the only one to propose going out n such and he started showing interest in my problems and life. On the other hand, he never even complemented me. Not even once. Inb4, yes, I do complement him. I may be shit at flirting, but I am not afraid to say to someone that they look handsome, pretty or I am in awe of their intelligence.

&#x200B;

And well, I've been in friendzone for like 2-3 yrs now. As I was finally realising that I have to stop thinking about this guy, I met another one. He hit on me, so I am clear that he does like me and we've been on a few dates, because my friends encouraged me to give it a try. And... I really have no idea what to feel anymore. I like this guy too, but I still think about the other one, who is right now basically one of my best friends. This other one is nice to talk to, but I don't care about him and don't worry about him. It may happen with time, but I don't know... shouldn't I feel something? Like a crush?

&#x200B;

What would you do in my situation? Would you try to make a move on the 2nd guy and try to get into a relationship with him (although I have no idea how on Earth should I do that, are there any kissing tutorials on youtube or sth? rotfl), or stop, since I am clearly not able to move on from the 1st guy? Probably I should confess to the 1st guy, but 1) i have really no idea how he feels and that could damage our friendship 2) and also make things harder for us in uni, since we study together 3) i am too afraid 4) i have no idea how to proceed even if he accepted my feelings.

88,,24,c74sqh,10,"It is a complex situation. She and I are recently separated and moving towards getting a divorce. Currently we have no legal separation agreement. She is increasingly hostile towards me and is refusing to speak with me regarding any details of our separation or divorce claiming that my lawyer should contact her lawyer... the problem being that she doesn?t have a lawyer. When I point that out she claims that I am harassing her and that she isn?t going to discuss any of that with me.  

I feel that it would be best for our son to become accustomed to being with his dad (me) without his mom in baby steps rather than at a judges order. I suggest that I bring him to my sisters place for an over night stay and she says I have no right to do that and outright refuses.  She throws our words like parental kidnapping. When I press the issue she claims that I am harassing her and she is going to report me to the police.  I asked my lawyer about this and was basically told ?don?t poke the bear, wait for an access agreement?. 

I suggested that she go visit her brother and leave our son home with me. Again, she refuses and says that I am harassing her and she again threatens to report me. 

She isn?t concerned that I won?t care for him, I am a great father and she acknowledges that - I regularly care for him from after work for several hours and put him down to bed, I take him for walks and to play in the park. Take him to visit the farm... etc... the problem is always when I suggest an over night period away from her.  

They co-sleep and I sleep in another room. In his 26+ months they have never spent a night apart.  He comfort nurses all night long. She often complains about sore nipples and poor sleep, but I have learned that if I suggest we change his sleeping habits it leads to a major fight (along the lines of she knows what?s best and I need to shut it and keep my opinion to myself). 

Sometimes she claims she cannot be away from him because he still nurses. While I feel that his nursing is fine and I encourage it because mamas milk is super healthy... it is not a necessity; he is over two years old.  And now I feel like her nursing is being used as a tool to interfere with my rights as his father. 

She initiated this divorce and now she is making things as difficult as possible to move it forward.   She blames me completely for causing her to want a divorce, however I feel that I have been working and working with a councillor to improve myself (mainly my communication) and meet her needs, and every time I get close to making progress she moves the goal posts and finds something else that is wrong and I need to work on and change about myself. I?ve realized it?s an unending cycle.  Often when she is blaming me for everything I think of the classic abusers line ?why do you make me do this to you?.  In 5 years together I cannot think of a single instance where she took ownership and responsibility for something she did wrong. 

She claims to be totally innocent of any wrong doing. I now realize that over the past 2 years she has isolated me from my friends and family, accused me of being mentally abusive because I sometimes come home tired or in a bad mood from working all day (she believes my bad mood is a form of abuse towards her - it makes no sense to me). I?ve recently realized that I am the one that has been getting abused and I began standing up for myself. This did not go over well with her as she considers anyone who disagrees or argues with her to be abusive towards her and disrespectful... basically if you don?t agree with her you are the enemy.

I do like her, but I think I like her as more of a friend than what I thought I did. She wants to hang out a lot, and this eats up a lot of my time that I could be using to build skills and prepare for my future. I eventually plan on moving to Japan, and she wants to work in American film. So I don't even really see a long-term relationship working out unless one of us wants our dreams to get broken. The one big dilemma with this is that she's going through some really hard things in life right now, and I don't want to be one of the things that tips her over the edge.

After the break up, he asked me to get back together because he wanted us to work on things. I was hesitant but said okay because at the end of the day I really care about him and I see a future with him together. Over our time together, he?s always been so good to me.

I recently inherited a home out of state from where we currently live. We decided to move there as the house is paid off, and cost of living is very low. Low enough that I can support him on my income alone while he goes back to school which he has wanted to do for a long time in order to have a career change (he is currently stuck in retail hell, I work remotely)

We found a program for the career he wants to get into near our future house, he quit his job, we packed up everything, rented a truck and are literally ready to leave. We were planning on driving out TOMORROW.

His family threw a little bbq today and we went over there to say our goodbyes. My bf failed to mention to me that he had been LYING to his entire family about our move. He told them all that he got a transfer with his company and would still be working full time. I accidentally let the cat out of the bag. He then wanted to leave early.

I don't understand why he did this. We tried talking about it and he just told me that he didnt want them to pressure him not to move. That was his only explanation.

I am pretty upset about this. 1.) He is now a proven LIAR. How do I trust that he isnt lying to me if he can lie to his own mother!?! (His family dynamic is a good one.) 2.) If he was so scared that he could be talked out of moving, it seems to me he isnt as serious about our relationship as he has indicated.

I thought we had a plan for our future together. One we both believed in and now I am not so sure of that. I'm heart broken. And I just dont have TIME now to deal with this. I just sold my car, all our stuff is packed and sitting on a truck, we have to be out by the 30th.

She?ll start taking shots at 8am when she wakes up, then drinks all day until she either passes out or makes it to the end of the day. Either way, I?d say she doesn?t go more than 5 hours without consuming alcohol. 

Recently I really started to notice how she doesn?t eat. Like ever. For instance last night I got to her house & she was hammered, been drinking all day, only ate a few bites of pizza. 

We woke up this morning & I noticed her eyes, the whites, are super yellow. Like noticeably a different color. I guess her entire body has a yellow glow to it. Im not a smart person, but I know that?s not a good thing. 

I guess the advice I?m looking for is how to bring my worry for her health up without cause a fight. She has a lot of people in her life that constantly give her shit about her drinking & I just don?t want to be another one of them. I?m crazy for her & I feel like she genuinely is for me, too. 

Also some guides for getting sober I guess in a safe way. From what she?s told me, she?s been drinking heavily since she was 16.

After 4 years, we broke up. After the 11 months that we?ve broken up, we both agreed to give it another shot. We broke up mainly because we just spent too much time together which resulted in us arguing too much. So, we decided to start giving eachother space and be nice and casual and loving and caring. 

All fun. All nice. It was great. I felt like I was in a relationship that was loving and it felt awesome. It?s now been 2 months and 10 days. Her family loves that we?re back together and my parents are too. I just feel different when I wake up, like a better person. We both work corporate jobs after college so after work we just spend time together. 

Now, last night was Friday night. She went out with friends. I didn?t give a shit because she usually does that and I usually go out with friends too. Idc. So today she comes to my apartment and we sat and watched TV and I casually asked her how her night was. She told me that it was nice and she had a good rime but she was really bored and went to her apartment a little early and I just shrugged it off. After a few hours she looked me in the eyes and said 

?okay like, please please please, don?t get angry at me.?

Now right then and there I knew she cheated. It was fairly obvious. I looked at her In the eyes and responded with ?dude do not tell me what I?m thinking please.?

And she did. She said that a man ate her out last night. She didn?t even know him. She was telling me all of this with her legs laying on my lap. I immediately pushed her legs off, and told her to get out. She started crying and said she understands, and walked out.

So my boyfriend and I have been together a little over a year. We got pregnant pretty early on, and have a one month old, so we've been having a go at a real relationship. 

Pretty early on I noticed some red flags. I moved in with him and his brother, and he would be really weird when I was home alone with his brother, he would video chat me and ask to see what I was wearing, and accused me of sleeping with his brother, or being attracted to him multiple times. I did not, and was not. He even went as far as to say he would kick me, and our unborn child out. He got upset one time when the only open seat in the room was next to his brother, and I sat in it versus standing.

I had to stop working because of a very difficult pregnancy, and now I'm completely reliant on his income to survive. I want to get a job, he doesn't think it's such a good idea, and would rather work 2 jobs himself.

If I do get the rare chance to go out and do something without him, he says things like""make sure you wear a bra."" ""Are you really going to wear those shorts?""""don't bring any guys back to the house, girls are okay though."" 
When I tell him how much those things hurt me, he says ""well you're just so attractive, I know everyone is looking at you."" I am above average looking, but I'm rather humble, and never walk out of the house looking indecent. My physical attributes are not something I can help.

It's gotten to the point where I don't want to go out anymore, because he makes me feel guilty about stuff that never happened. It's not fun to feel guilty for something you didn't and never intended to do.

The last time we hung out was quite long ago, and I honestly don't know how I did it. I get so nervous around her.

I asked an old friend for advice (we live very far from each other but we keep in touch through Discord) and she told me to act casually, try to talk about the school year and teachers (she said that those are topics that you can talk about for quite some time) and that I should dress casually in light colors with my hair down (I have very long hair that honestly looks best either down or in certain, complex styles).

So I was like omg and went back to sleep. Next day we talked about it he said he couldn?t sleep and I was sleeping and it helps him sleep, so ok whatever got over it... or I told myself too. When really I felt grossed out/ disrespected I had heard that and that I was literally right in the room (our bathroom is in our bedroom). I let it go. 

I was always told masturbation was normal so even though it makes me uncomfortable I accept it because I realize it?s unrealistic to ask someone to not masturbate. 

Fast forward a week later, ( I never look through his phone, what for?) I forget what I was doing on it, but he was right next to me. And I saw his emojis that he was using the peach and the tongue emoji.. ( he doesn?t use emojis often and I know it sounds stupid) but seeing that really gave me a gut feeling it was porn related and I?ve caught him watching live porn which we established I was NOT okay with and he said that?s fine he doesn?t have to watch that kind... seeing that make me automatically think he was watching it again. I asked him and he lied to me and I seen it in his face... I know when he?s lying and after like 20 mins of me calling him a liar for ?not remembering? what he used those emojis for he told me the truth he was commenting on a porn video and he used them.

It bothered me so much... like wow you can?t just watch, the girl impresses you so much you needed to leave an emoji, not just words but a picture to show everyone how infatuated you were... I?m sure it?s insecurity.. I mean I don?t think I?m ugly but I know I don?t have a porn star body and it makes me feel like maybe he?d prefer that or he?s looking to porn to fulfill himself where I?m lacking... 

He felt really bad and has been really sweet trying to make it better but I don?t want him to feel like I?m telling him he can?t masturbate but idk how to change these feelings....",Masturbation?,0.67

He claims he was using it to find ""friends"" but I know it was to try and start talking to new girls as our relationship has been rocky for quite some time. This isn't the first time I've found out about him using tinder either. There has been other issues in the past where he has dm'ed a girl on instagram and that girl actually reached out to me and sent me the messages my bf was sending her. I've started having some trust issues with him from all these incidents and whenever I would try to talk to him he would throw my past mistakes in my face and almost try to make it seem like what he has done is okay due to me not being innocent either. He believes that I have been unfaithful, when I have not and doesn't seem to trust me. He is constantly accusing me of cheating, sneaking around and has taken my phone from me multiple times just to check to see who I've been talking to. I leave the house for work and the occasional errand and rarely even visit my best friend. I have assured him in the past numerous times that I would never cheat and if I wanted to cheat on him so badly like he seems to think, I would just leave the relationship. He has low self esteem as do I and he has isolated himself as well so we are always together and are each others main source of interaction. I know that doesn't help. We've talking about having a family, moving, and getting old together as some of our goals but I just don't know what to do or how to talk out any of this since whenever we do talk about these issues it turns into an argument and no one really gets their point across. We're both aware that we still love each other but i'm not sure that love can repair the trust issues, among other things in our relationship that are causing our constant fights. I told him to leave last night so I could think about things over the weekend but i'm at a loss. I want to repair our relationship (which i know wouldn't be immediate) and get it to a point of renewal and almost start over but I just don't know what else to do. I have cut out a lot of people from my life as well as activities due to this trust problem where as I feel like he just keeps doing things to make the trust less and less between us and that the mistake he made was not a big deal what so ever.

114,,1,c752vy,4,"Hi everyone, apologies if this is very lengthy, I?ll include a TL;DR at the bottom.

Let me start off by saying that my main issue is that my parents treat my brother way better than they treat me and they expect different things from us, expecting me to pay for simple things like a toothbrush or deodorant while he, an actual adult, didn?t have to pay for anything while he still lived at home until 26. They are also way more lenient with him than with me.

I asked my dad if he can buy me a new toothbrush because mine was old, I asked him because he is the one that buys all of that stuff for the whole family and he said no and I can buy my own. This might not seem strange, but in my country kids don?t get jobs at 16 like in America or European countries. We finish school and go to college full time and only start working after college, it?s very rare for a young person to have a job while still in school. So our parents buy all our things for us and pay for school and so on. 

I get a monthly allowance which equals about $70, and they expect me to buy all my clothes and essentials with that. With $70 you can barely buy a pair of jeans and short sleeved shirt. So this will not be enough to buy all the things I need in a month. I also asked my dad when we?re going to a new Italian Restaurant that opened up that HE suggested, and he said ?Are you going to pay? to which I replied no and then he asked if I was going to pay for my part, this is strange because he always pays and he does not receive a small salary, he receives a very large one by my country?s standard, so it?s not as though he can?t pay. 

You might think ?It?s no big deal of your dad to expect you to pay for your own dinner or monthly essentials? and it might not be, my main issue is that my dad bought ALL my brother?s things for him until he was 26 and he pats for all of my mom?s things even though she has a well paying job, he also gives her money every month to spoil herself. My dad never expected my brother to pay for his dinner or take the entire family out, when my brother married his wife two years back he kept on paying for them at dinner even though my brother had started working after moving out and received a decent salary and trust me, they ate the most expensive meals at restaurants because they knew my dad was gonna pay amd not once did he have a problem with it, but know he expects me, an 18-year-old who is still in school, to pay for all my things and even dinner while I only get an allowance. My brother got an allowance from the ages of 13 up until 26 which was way more than mine, which I only started getting at 17. My mom always paid for gas for his car.

Now, you might think maybe they are so hard on me because I?m a bad kid. I?m not, I?m a straight A student, never got in trouble anywhere, never done drugs, never smoked, never drank and I have a good relationship with my parents. While my brother on the other hand got in trouble a few times, he has written his car off, he has crashed and wrecked my dad?s motorbike because he was being stupid and reckless and fucked his leg up. He has left his sports? equipment outside at school and got it stolen while my parents had paid for a locker for him to put it in, he has lost watches and cellphones and got them all replaced by my parents while I have done nothing of the sort. God forbid I do something of the sort. He also had to repeat two years of college (college isn?t free where I live) while I got a scholarship that pays for half of my first year of college.

It?s just unfair that he never had to pay for anything while he was being reckless and irresponsible with his belongings and I get told that I have to pay for a $3 toothbrush. He could also do what he wanted and go out with friends until them A.M, while my dad complains when I want to go watch a movie until 20:30. 

Another major issue is that my parents always tell me ?You?re an adult now, act like it?, ?You?re not a baby anymore? when I complain about something but I?m not even allowed to watch something that?s rated PG16, I?m not even allowed to watch Two Broke girls or The Big Bang Theory. My dad told me to read him the description of a series he said we should watch and in the description it said something about sex so he said we can?t watch it, I?m 19 in December for fucks sake. 

Does anyone have any advice for me, please?

TL;DR My parents expect me to pay for all my things even though I only receive an allowance, while my brother could free ride until college. They also treat me like a baby until they feel like I should be an adult.","Tired of my parents (M53, F51) treating me (F18) differently than my brother (M28), what can I do?",0.84

&#x200B;

I went to a party yesterday with a bunch of my friends, all mostly 16 year olds. I acted as I normally do, literally nothing out of the ordinary. For context, I tend to say ""love you"" to a lot of people. Girls, guys, it doesn't matter. It's obviously a joke, and it's usually met with a sarcastic wink or a ""oh my gosh, no way"" with heavy sarcasm. I think every person at the party knows it. Nobody has ever asked me to stop or said it makes them uncomfortable, especially since a lot of them say it back unprompted and I answer with a fake shot to the heart or something. It's basically just a big joke that we're all in on. 

Anyways, my friend texted me this morning asking me if I meant it when I said ""love you"" to him at the party. I was confused and said no, I was joking. I was really confused because we had sent it to each other on Snap before, and he had seen me say it to other people before. He said that he was just kind of confused, and I cleared everything up and said yeah no I don't want to date you or anything, you're a great friend but I just don't like anyone right now, and he agreed with everything and understood it was just a joke. After that, he said ""also the boys are always talking about how you are confusing and misleading based on your actions so I'll advice you not to do those pranks"". So I said woah, who's saying that? And he said he wasn't going to give out names, and he just wanted to ""advice \[me\] as a friend"". So I responded back by saying that he was being wack because he came out of nowhere saying this stuff and then won't tell me who said it. I asked him how he would feel if I said that to HIM, and he said he wouldn't mind.

At this point I'm just a little bit pissed because he just said this stuff without warning and then won't back it up. He then sent me this (yes, this is word for word, spelling errors and all) - ""Btw i assumed this because you were acting like it. for example you being so touchy, the snaps you send, the things you SAY, (asking why I never start convos, snaps saying I Luv u jkjk, the same thing again on insta, and again last night, etc) i can go on and on. the point is, i'm pretty sure that all this is something you do all the time as a joke, but some people might think it's an indirect message, meaning you secretly like the other person. i'm sharp and i know my shit but if some other person was a bit more un cautious and gullible, they would've felt bad after you tell them that it was a joke. like i said, i know and heard from a lot of my friends and your friends that you are really confusing and misleading. just don't say things like ""i love you"" carelessly, save that for someone you really like that you might meet someday.""

So I read it and I see his point. If someone didn't really know me and heard that, they'd definitely think something of it. However, I've only said it to a couple people that I KNOW don't take it as something more, because I don't want to start any drama or anything. But the things he said about me asking him why he never starts conversations and the snaps and the insta last night don't really hold up. He always complains to me that we don't talk enough, and then never starts conversations (which I told him). The snaps I send him are usually pictures of my room or my face with the spiral filter on and some dumbass caption.  Last night we send each other maybe 4 texts on insta, and it was him just saying that he took a shower (there was a dunk tank at the party) and me saying ok. 

Back to the texts. We kept going back and forth, with him saying that he was just respecting both parties and me saying that this was not respect. Eventually I just asked him if the friends in question asked him to say anything.

He said no.

So now I'm pretty mad. He decided to butt in and try to fix the problem himself. I said - ""Then I don't get it because you're telling me that someone or some people are saying these things about me, and then when I ask who's saying it you just say ""I don't have the privilege to expose people like that"". It doesn't make sense to tell me someone is talking bad about me and then not say who it is, it just sounds like you're the one saying it but you don't wanna say it to my face"". He then replied with - ""how does it not make sense to you? its perfectly normal. that's just crazy"". I'm pretty upset at all this because he's not giving me a solid reason, and how can I believe that people are actually saying this just based on what he's telling me? 

Then he said, after I told him what he's saying is violating their trust because they never asked him to say anything, - ""because my friends are not having a good time with you and i thought that was unfortunate and tried to solve the problem like a real friend would"". After that, shit just hit the fan because I was really mad that he would try to take it in his own hands and solve the problem.

I understand that he's probably just trying to help, but I'm really mad at the way he did it. It doesn't help that he kept calling me ""buddy"" and being sarcastic in all his messages while also sending me happy face emojis and emotes. If there is honestly a problem, I would like to know who is upset with me. I'm a really direct person, and if there's a problem or issue I usually take care of it right away and straight up ask what's wrong so we can fix things without any beating around the bush or making things more complicated. I want to know who is uncomfortable with me saying ""love you"" and being too personal with them so that I know to not do it and be less touchy with them. If he keeps refusing to tell me then how am I going to know what to do? He's basically just telling me to take his word for it, but at this point I don't really trust him anymore. 

What should I do? I can always just text someone else that's close to him and ask what's going on, but that'll probably make things more complicated. I can apologize to him and try to get more information, but he's just going to refuse and argue with me again. I want to fix the problem and stop making these people uncomfortable, but I can't do that if he doesn't tell me who I'm hurting. I really need advice.","Me (16F) and my friend (16M) are in a fight because he says that the way I act around some of our friends makes them uncomfortable, however they never asked him to say anything.

We have a lot in common and generally have fun when we are together, and it?s still the case. But since February, her sexually energy has been very low, in contrast to when we first started dating she was very sexual. And since 2 months ago, we haven?t had sex at all. We?ve had multiple conversations about it, I?ve asked her if it was anything I did wrong or if there is anything I can do to improve. But she always says ?I don?t know why?, and says that it just doesn?t  sound appealing to her and that it?s nothing with me. I?ve been very patient and understanding, but there is no sign of it getting better. On top of that, she?s admitted that she?s touched herself when I?m away, and we are together very often. Which sounds kind of fishy. On top of that, she talks to a guy she met on the internet a long time ago, who she used to be very sexual with. They have never met in person, but they talk very often, and once, when I was curious, I went through her phone. I know it?s bad, but it?s always mad me uncomfortable and she seems to hide out relationship from him.  I found that they used to sext and send nudes A LOT, and they were doing it only a WEEK before we started officially dating. They have even told each other they love each other. Which to me seems twisted since they have never met in real life. I?ve told her in the past that I?m not comfortable with it, but she said the famous lines ?he?s just a friend and that?s all he will ever be?, which put a bad taste in my mouth. Shes always been very honest. I?ve never caught her lying and she hasn?t had any inappropriate conversations with him since we?ve started dating. But it still makes me uneasy, especially stacked with the no sex thing. We?ve gotten into several arguments over this guy, and she says I have no right to choose who she cares about and who she chooses to talk to. Of course she?s right, but It hurts my feelings that she doesn?t consider how it makes me uncomfortable.

What should I do? I want to trust her and believe that he?s only a friend, but it?s hard for me to believe that you can go from sending nudes to someone and telling them you love them, to just being ?friends? and never crossing over that line again.

As for the sex thing, she said she?s going to see a sex counselor, but it?s been months and nothing has happened yet. I love her, but my sexual frustration is starting to make me stare at other girls, making me feel like shit about myself.

I used to cut myself A LOT so I told her about how addictive and dangerous it gets and that she should try to see a therapist before it gets too hard. She told me she would and that she'd try to stop.
Today she doesn't want to get an appointment because she's scared she won't be diagnosed with depression, and she often walks around in shorts, showing everyone her big, red, self-harm scars.

This freaked me out quite a bit so I paid the $ to get premium and saw the account was active in the last 72 hours. That was yesterday. I asked my GF about it today and she said she has no dating profiles, doesn't know why that profile exists and would let me read her emails or go through her phone if I want.

I tried to research if pictures can be automatically posted to CMB if you are friends on FB with the person you connected with. I tried putting a support ticket in about it, but so far I have come up with nothing. Nothing at this point seems to point towards pictures don't automatically show up. That you have to select which ones you want in order for them to be there. I'm hoping I'm wrong but...

One red flag in my relationship is that she has borrowed some money from me. A little under $5k total since last August. She's paid back about half. I knew there was chance I was being scammed, so I was going to live with losing the money if things didn't work out. A few times she's asked for a few hundred (part of the $5k) because there's fraud on her card. This has happened twice. Could just be Chase, but she has yet to pay those amounts back. I don't ever ask her when she's going to pay me back or even bring up the subject of borrowed money. She volunteers regularly to me that she feels really bad bout owing me money and that she is trying to make it a priority to pay me back.

The other red flag is she often says she'll call me back and then doesn't, sometimes until the next day. I never really pushed the issue before but I've never experienced a scenario where someone says regularly ""I'll call you back in a few minutes"" and then I don't hear from them until the following day. It just seems odd. How do you routinely forget to call your BF/GF back literally all the time? Are some people just like that?

Should I believe her or is this too many red flags?

124,,10,c77cpg,0,"So I (19F) am the crew lead of a maintenance crew and one of the crew members (27ishM)  (who is the former crew lead, but he got demoted and I got his job) is an overweight and greasy my little pony and anime obsessed man. He has verbally abused me, by screaming insults and cursing at me and has sexually harassed me in the past. 

When I brought these complaints to the woman in charge of my crew (above me) she heard my side of the story and then heard his. He admitted he had sexually harassed me and been verbally abusive. He didn?t deny anything. Also he told her he feels really sad because he has no friends and no one likes him. He faced no consequences for his actions. Instead, my boss told me to be a little more forgiving and make some allowances for him because he is so insecure. 

Let me emphasize, being around this person makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. He hasn?t been verbally abusive in a while, but at every chance he has he undermines my leadership in front of the whole crew. Saying he?ll never listen to me and I don?t know how to do my job etc etc. I asked my other boss to have a talk with him about how he needs to behave better, because nothing I could possibly say will be listened to. However, my other boss told me something similar. Like, that?s just how he is, and I should be more understanding and not let things get to me. He also told me that my problematic coworker didn?t grow up with a father in the picture so I needed to make some allowances for his bad behavior. He also said he doesn?t want to let this man go because he is a great worker. 

How can I make any progress with this situation? I?m so tired of being treated badly and disrespected by him but I feel like I?ve tried everything and said everything and nothing works. It?s worth noting that I work for a university and am a student employee, so I?m not part of a union and I?ve talked to all the higher ups I can.",Verbally abusive and repellent coworker,0.5
125,,0,c742vc,1,"I am still healing from this heartbreak but it was over a year ago. I moved on I have new friends talk to different people and in a good spot in life. But when I was 15 and a sophomore in High school. I decided to start sitting with this guy who was 1 grade ahead of me and a little over 2 years older than me. He is very quiet and like I knew him for 2 years and didn't hear him talk for a while. He literally sat alone, literally at the lunch table and I thought he was an interesting person and I talked to him a little bit on Facebook, we were friends on fb, I knew of him. Thing is, like he is a borderline internet addict and that's the only way he interacts with people. Well I decided to sit with him out of an act of kindness I really felt bad just wanted to be a friend to someone. I don't want anyone to feel alone, it sucks. He seemed just to be a quiet, asocial guy who's awkward. I am awkward in my own way. I was diagnosed with autism at 4, he figured out I was autistic pretty early and he's smart. Well nothing really bad at all happened. We talked about history and school stuff. We could talk about anything. We were two young intellectual men who just talked about a lot of stuff academically. Not just stuff two typical 15 and 17 year old boys talk about. His family knew of my family as a matter of fact. His uncle was one of my father's close friends. It's a small town, everyone knows each other. Well we were in the same geometry class, he wasn't allowed to advance to the next level of math. We would talk in school, at the table, on fb messenger. Well early on he would do dumb stuff like he took nacho cheese and smeared it on my book then looked at me. I just thought he was awkward didn't know what to do. Then when I ask him what a ""dyke"" was, he asked me to ask the English teacher on lunch patrol. Because he studies English, I thought it was innocent joking but yeah. I didn't notice much but I guess I asked him if it grinds his gears that he literally helped me with geometry and everything. Yet I somehow got a much better grade than him and passed the standardized test. I had a terrible loss in my family, he was there for me for it. Early on like when we talked for a couple months, he sent my mom a Facebook friend request. She declined it not knowing who he was. Then months later he says something about her declining it, like he was surprised she declined it. Then I told him I would talk to her tell her who he was and basically explain, he's awkward and to accept it. She did, then he said when she accepted it he wanted to message her. I didn't really care, he didn't follow through never did. At the table, he openly told me he was involved in some online drama, and like he trolls people.

Well it's fine for a year I thought he's this really nice even keeled guy. The next school year, he's a senior and I felt bad I couldn't sit with him at the table because I was in a couple college classes when I was a junior and my schedule didn't even give me a lunch period. He sat alone the WHOLE YEAR. He would always sit alone even back in middle school. Everything was fine. Then he invited me to sit with him and his family at this show at my school, I sat with them and everything. BTW, I was literally his best friend. He has all these online friends I guess. Well months go by and like towards when he was going to graduate. I tell him about a girl I met out of town. He sends her a friend request on every form of social media. She flirted with me since she met me and like tried to get my attention. She's attractive too. Well, I got a provacative shirt and he wanted to get the same exact one. He said if he wore it people would freak out, yet people encouraged me. I was interested in asking her to hangout. He was very supportive. He told me about his crush on a girl since he was in 6th grade or so. He would go around and message people, like guys she dated, her close friends and everything to dig for information and yeah. I decided to go to the gym to lose weight, eat better diet. He decides to diet. I got my driving license permit, he asked me about it and was really interested in his permit. Thing is he comes from a poor family and lives in low income housing. Has 2 older siblings. Things were good, only thing was he took me pointing stuff out like a guy who posted on fb he got a 42 on a test gets a lot of likes, like they support him. He took it as me judging him. I shortly told him about a girl I talked to when I was 14 and he immediately adds her. Next day she declines. She doesn't know him. He would ask me for people's names in geometry (girls) so he could add them. I told him a story about a girl randomly giving me her # he said I should've given it to him. Back to the point. Everything was good. We both joked about how he was like my therapist and my boy in one. Friends are great support to talk about problems with.

Then, he graduated and all was good for like a month or two MAX. Then over the summer we started hanging out and I met his older sister who's like 9 years older than myself. Well I was contemplating reaching out to the girl I met out of town. I got my license and immediately, he wanted his permit but didn?t get it. He would say stuff like if we hung out, he would ride in my truck bed. Well he developed a weird fixation with her, like he tried following her on Instagram and he would comment compliments on her pics only to get them removed. He would talk to his sister about her like he knew her personally, used her first name and talked about her like she?s a close friend someone he knows. Then I changed my mind, well now he wants to go after her and like he has some fixation, he wanted me to message her and encourage her to message him. Right after i got my license he said he would like to ride in my truck and go to another town to go to a coffee place.He?s a creep and it?s weird I know for a fact she wants nothing to do with him. He was very aggressive about talking about graphic and sexual things. Well he has a laundry list of celeb crushes and girls/women he goes to school with. He has a laundry list of fantasies and are so filthy his mind is so perverted with them. Well, i start talking to him more in depth about this older girl I talked to when I was 14. She would flirt with me, get shy. Stare at me a lot, get red, try to talk to me any opportunity she could, get close, want selfies with me.Her friend would too and like offer me a ride, find any excuse to be around me. Parents friends and family told me she liked me clearly but I got a vibe from her and she borderline stalked and harassed me. He would listen to me talk and at first was supportive. I specified that I do not have romantic feelings for her but I do have platonic feelings for her and care about her. Then he started saying? after everything i said and he says he was helping me with killing my ego and ego death or whatever. Sounded more like he didn?t like me having self esteem and feels insecure easily and no self confidence so I am not allowed to but OK. Well then he got me into a group chat with him and his sister and all he did was criticize me about me and me ego. Didn?t say a thing in person. Then he like blackmailed me into telling his sister embarrassing stuff because I didn?t think a certain way and told him something. I guess with this girl hes crushed on since elementary school, he met up with a guy whos close to her or dated her in the past. Only to dig for information about her, nothing more he did it JUST to do that. No relationship beyond that. There are like 4 girls/women i can list off that he had weird lustful feelings for and fixations with. Like one is filthy and known for being promiscuous and is just filthy, poor hygiene. Wears revealing clothes and likes to take pics in bikinis put them on instagram. He said he wanted to reach out to her and has some weird lustful feelings for her. Whenever I spoke negatively of her said she was dirty, he could do better. Got very defensive and sensitive. Said I was judging her. Well, when I talked about my past female friend negatively, he basically blackmailed me and like wanted to repeat what I said to her younger brother. Message him to dig for information or something or get his opinion on me and his sisters relationship. I basically said no and he said ?censorship?. Basically reach out to her brother on fb and message him out of nowhere when they haven?t talked in school. He said he wanted to help me reconnect with her or something along the lines of that. So me and her can be friends again but I wasn?t entirely sure about how i feel or if I actually want anything to do with her. Well he said he was going to have this taken care of and its like he was planning something. He basically said he was going to help me and he wanted to contact her eventually when she doesn?t know him and vice versa. Like he wanted to go out to eat at the restaurant she works at and I felt something was up. I just notice he got somewhat angry when speaking of her. I would tell him stuff she did and he said he wish a girl did that to him. When we talked about her he then later told me that he told his mom some unsettling things about us. So fast forward a month later I got upset and said something to his sister and it wasn?t that bad, just what I thought. Word gets back to him he?s fine. He started getting very aggresive and evidently had some anger towards me and just bring up nonsense. Well he blew up a week later over nothing sent me a bunch of rants, then blocked me when I didn?t respond or try to add fuel to the fire. Whole family removes me off facebook. We talk for another month.I ran into him in person with my mom and his family and he was shifty eyed didn?t look at me just waved. Then messages me saying he talked to his brother (who knows her) about my relationship with her. Only to tell me he said negative stuff and basically says we have nothing in common, I can?t see us being friends and why she would want anything to do with me. About a month goes by, we were talking about her I say something negative about her like I have the self respect to walk away and not deal with her. He started blowing up started a fight then threatened to message her to tell her to block me or tell her the negative stuff. Then wanted to message her and went on and on and on. I pleaded for him not to do so. I don?t want to be known for being friends with a freak who messages random women. Then just goes on and on. Starts saying I am controlling who he talks to and forcing my feelings onto him for someone I don?t like. Well I stopped talking to him forever after that. He reached out to a guy he knows I am friends with and talked to, so he can help work it out and I just assume so he can talk to her.^(wh)",Why would a friend turn into this,1.0

128,,12,c75l0x,13,"Hi everyone, first time writing here. I've been in a very wierd place for the most part of today, realizing that i don't have the courage to even talk to my best friend about this for the fear of being judged. I've spent a significant amount of time here reading peoples experiences, and also the great advice that one can receive from strangers. I hope you guys can help me out.

So a bit of context, i have a dual citizenship with my parents' families living very far away from each other meaning i rarely spend time with the other half. This year i decided to spend the summer in the city where the other half of my family lives, so i landed a summer job here. This woman dated my uncle quite along time ago (i think they broke up 6 or 7 years ago?), but she's still stayed in close contact with my family over the years. Shes always been a good support to my other family members including my mom, so i've always been very fond of her. Not to mention that she is unbelievably attractive (noone believes shes 42), and is a kind, sincere, and understanding person who has given me advice over the years growing up. I used to just see her when she was meeting my mom or something, but over the past few years when i've visited, i've always hung out with just here, somewhere, in a totally friendly manner.

Right when i came here, i messaged her saying that i was in town, but only got around to setting up a meetup this week. She asked me to meet up with her at some bar last night where we drank, and talked about our lives. We had a similar encounter the year before where i definately felt some tension, but didn't even consider acting out on anything. This time it was way more intense, to the point where she confessed about her attraction to me. She told me that there was no point in me lying - that she could feel what i felt, so i didnt deny it. I tried my best to hold myself back, but after having a few drinks and having her come on to me so strong, it felt like i had no control. We made out erotically by her car, then went over to hers to have sex - which was incredible. She told me afterwards that she has feelings for me, and wants to make this the summer of my lifetime. I even agreed to go on a roadtrip with her next weekend. 

I try to live by a certain set of principles, one being not making any plans drunk, another being to properly communicate with someone about our intentions and the future BEFORE we have sexual intercourse. Many times in my life, thinking with my dick before my head has had me end up in the most fucked up places - and i feel like i'm fucking up now. Just to note that i've had a history with my mom of being rebellious and giving her a bad time, and continually lying to her about everythibg. We have abled to reconcile that time by basing our relationship on honesty, which has always kept me close to her. I spoke with my mom today, and when she asked what  i did yesterday i told her that i was hanging out with this woman, but essentially lied by telling her that i dont even know where she stays. I wouldn't know how to explain going on a roadtrip with her, because in my mind it seems super suspicious that we randomly spend the weekend together. 

I've been imagining the scenario where my family would find out, and i'm pretty sure that my uncle would despise me, because lets be honest its pretty fucking petty for me to have sex with his ex girlfriend, not to mention spending time with her in a romantic context. I'd definately get strongly judged by everyone else, and with the overall family drama and current health issues that some members have i feel reluctant to add any more onto the table. I feel extremely conflicted between the feelings i have for her, and the respect i have for my family, especially my uncle. I'm having serious regrets about opening Pandora's box before even considering the long run implications. 

TL;DR - I had sex with my uncles ex girlfriend, and now she wants to keep doing it, and even wants to go on a trip with me. I'm having some regrets about not making rational decisions while being in the moment.

129,,2,c76yof,1,"Before I started dating my current gf, i talked to alot of girls and only ever kissed 2 but nothing more. I was still friends (strong word) with them and she knew from other ppl what happened in the past. after this, she has been very suspicious of me and other girls. im interested in a certain type of girl and the 2 girls and my current gf all have this characteristic (being purposely vague). i dont think she likes that and i have assured her that nothing serious even happened with them but she doesnt want to believe it because in the past i foolishly bragged about what i did with them to my friends and overhyped it. to try and calm her suspicions, i tried to thoroughly explain everything that happened in the past. a few days ago i was on facebook messenger with my sister and i could tell she was reading my screen when i was in the main page of the app with all ur contacts and previous messages. I dont know why i did it but i instinctively turned my screen away. this set her off and made her want to look to see what i was hiding. I am not hiding anything but im just scared of the possibility that there could be anything. she found an old conversation with one of the girls and asked why i would be messaging her if we werent even close. she said it didnt line up with what i told her about my past relationships with the girl.

I find it hard to blame her. with only recent context, it seems like she is extremely controlling. however, i used to talk about girls to her when we were becoming a thing and i was very immature at the time.. i would also be very insecure in her situation. this is both of our first relationships. it's been over a year and we are as certain as we can be that we are the loves of each others lives. this is our only problem.

I made a list of suggestions, ways we could have a ?break? from one another to try and gain some perspective because the daily arguing was exhausting and things were being said that couldn?t be unheard. I had cried everyday, for a year. I think so did she, the neighbours thought of us as the soggy lesbian couple. 
When I took my paper and pen to the lounge where she was watching tv and asked her if she wanted to talk about it, she said no. And we never did really.  By then she had announced on reddit that her marriage was over and she was 20% relieved. I read it later that night as my heart shattered. She had also text her parents. So I found myself kind of accidentally single. She never asked me why I said what I said, just that I was unfair and in the wrong. I just wonder Reddit, who broke up with who? She says I did obviously, and I?m prepared to take the blame because even the mention of ending the marriage is provocative. It?s just not what I meant and the word ?talk? had been included in my sentence on purpose.

Anyway , I used to be really interested in sex. I'm a 28F and it's not like I don't have confidence in myself. I'm a very sexual person and I am very happy with how I look. I kickbox so I'm in great shape as well and I have no complaints in the looks department. 
I'm a teacher and I've always been super attracted to intellectual types. Intelligence is the number one factor that determines if I'm attracted to someone. I read voraciously and watch a lot of documentaries and listen to podcasts.  
I met my current boyfriend about 5 months ago. In the beginning I was super interested in sex but now I just can't bring myself to have sex with him. I don't know why. We tried to have sex and I was just so turned off when we were doing it. He isn't super intellectual but he is intelligent . 
Hopefully you guys don't judge me. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm more intellectual than him and while that's ok , I feel like he hasn't engaged in any intellectual conversation that I've initatied. He is definitely smart but he doesn't read books and I'm not saying that anyone who doesn't read is terrible, but I would be turned on more if he read books. Even a little. 

 I should Also add that our future is rocky because I DEFINITELY don't want kids and he definitely does so I've been going back and forth on whether we should stay together. I enjoy spending time with him and he is really funny but for some reason I don't feel attracted to him anymore. I am on meds for a condition that I have and they have been known to reduce libido so maybe it's that. 

Anyway , he wanted to have sex a while back and I tried to get him to intellectually stimulate me by talking about things I am interested in : astrophysics, literature , linguistics , science in general ,philosophy , etc. Didn't work. 
Then I played a documentary in the background and closed my eyes. I asked him to be completely silent and bam.  In a few minutes I get turned on and we were able to have sex. 
Full disclosure , you know how people have lists of famous people they want to sleep with ? Well all of mine are either scientists or really intellectual actors/ fictional characters. Sherlock (not necessarily Benedict Cumberbatch) turns me on  a lot , and at the top of the list is Professor Brian Cox.  Cue laughter from you guys. 
Anyway ,if I play his lectures in the background I come within minutes. When he talks about quantum mechanics and spectroscopy my entire body responds to it in a way I can't explain. 
It also works if I play interesting podcasts , like the NYT one or podcasts on Greek mythology or literature. If I open my eyes or hear my boyfriend speaking it gets completely ruined.

134,,8,c73c7k,10,"This is going to be very rant-y and word-vomit-y so I apologize in advance. 

I've known my current boyfriend for 9 months. It's not a long time, I know, but we hit it off really quickly and tried to take things very slow initially. We had both just gotten out of long term relationships (mine 6 years, his 4) and were on Tinder because we have needs... so really, neither of us were looking for anything when we met. 

In the beginning, through some Insta and FB stalking, I found his entire pages were covered with pictures with him and his ex, even their ""we're official"" announcement was still up. Heck, he even had a little note from her on his bedroom wall! I thought he was cheating on her with me up until the point he told me he had just gotten out of this long term relationship. She had decided she didn't want to move north and told him she thought she'd be fine if she never had kids when he always made it very clear he wanted them. 

I really liked this guy. We clicked. I don't click with people, in fact, I'm terrible with people. I could tell right away I was going to fall in love with him very quickly. I have never felt the way I feel about him before in my life. I loved my ex, yes, but this was different. This IS different. 

In the 9 months we've known each other, I know he didn't have enough time to get over her. I firmly believe that you cannot get over someone completely if you can still see everything they're up to, but I don't like telling people what they can and cannot do. It's not my style. If you want to be with me, be with me. If you want to be with someone else, be with them. 

To the point: I am insecure about his ex, because he never told me that he still keeps in contact with her. I was fine with this because I never really asked, but still... c'mon. I am insecure that he still has all of the pictures up of them on his FB and Insta wall. I am insecure because he still has their ""FB Official"" announcement in his life events. I am insecure because I have seen him watch someone else open his ex's Insta Story, then open his phone to watch it himself. I am insecure because, even though I figured out it was about his dog, he still has that note from her up on his wall. I am insecure because I feel like if she sees he's moving on without her she will get jealous and want him back.. 

I know I should have said something sooner about it. I know I should be able to tell the person I love and am with when I'm uncomfortable about things, but it's too late for that now. 

This weekend, my BF and I had been planning a short backpacking trip so I went over to his house after he got off work to help get things set up. When I get there, I can tell something is wrong so I ask him what the matter is and he asks if we can go for a drive. He's very visibly upset, but he holds my hand as we walk out to the truck and gives me a couple of reassuring kisses, but I'm not dumb, I know what's happening. 

We start driving and he tells me he thinks we may have rushed into things and he is so sorry. He really likes me and really likes being with me, but he didn't think he had enough time to process the whole breakup with his ex and it's put him into a very big funk. He doesn't want to break up, he wants me in his life, but he needs some time and to step back for a bit so that he can heal and be able to give me his whole heart because I deserve that. 

I listened, I understand completely. So I decide it's time to tell him. I tell him about my insecurity with his ex and how I was always afraid to post things because she might see it and decide she's made a huge mistake and want him back and I would lose him. I tell him everything I've seen, about the stupid note on his wall for his dog... I want him to know what I've seen and that these are the reasons why I understand, why I know he isn't over her. 

Then he tells me I was right. She saw pictures of us on vacation together and reached out to him on Wednesday. Apparently, she was very nice and asked him to figure out what he wanted to do with the rest of his stuff he left down there. This of course led to them talking. And now she's telling him everything he wanted to hear 9 months ago. She told him he took her too literally when she said she could see herself not having kids, but she could see herself having his kids... etc. etc. etc. And he got very upset because why didn't she say anything 9 months ago? 6 months ago? 3 months ago? How convenient for her to tell him this now. 

We talk some more. I don't remember to many of the specifics from here but we had an amazing discussion. I feel so bad for him that he's going through all of these emotions and is so confused and doesn't know what to do. I spent the night with him last night and woke up in the middle of the night to him still awake. I was so angry. I couldn't help myself but start telling him how mad I was at her and how dare she? How dare she see you moving on and become jealous when she decided she didn't want to go with him. How dare she think his life would be nothing without her and he would come crawling back! How dare she not fight for him when she had the chance all those months ago if she really wanted to be with him! There's more, but you get the idea. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone who has been through something similar has any advice. I'm sure a lot of people will tell me to let him go and move on, but I don't want to. I know it's na?ve of me, but whenever we are together he makes me feel so good and so loved, I forget about all of my insecurities (the above scenarios were seldom - most of the time we never have our phones out when we are with one another). I love him. I really do. I know he loves me and is being completely honest with me about this. And I know everyone sucks here: me for not saying anything sooner, him for moving too quickly, and her for not doing anything sooner.

She spent months and months trying to get me to go on a date with her and I finally did. 
She seemed so into me. Like crazy into me. She slept with me from date 1 and was extremely intimate. Like really cuddly and saying she ?missed me? when I wasn?t there and that ?I made her feel safe?. She also said I was exactly her type and implied I was basically everything she wanted. We texted all the time. She said a few weird things too, but I thought I?d just let those go for now. I really liked her. 

I knew she was a bit untrusting since her ex so I didn?t want to push too hard. I just enjoyed the nice dates, amazing sex and just general presence of an super confident and stunning girl. 

Then eventually I asked about exclusivity. Just asked what the deal was and if she was seeing anyone else. She flipped. Implied I was controlling and honestly I felt a bit creepy being sat there. I couldn?t see her for a while after this and we kinda left it up in the air as she said ?she would just keep doing it what she was doing until I actively decided to leave because she was enjoying our situation?. Whatever our situation was. Obviously this was hard for me as she knew I had fallen for her. 

It eventually ended up with her calling me ?obsessed? over text when I said it seemed like she didn?t care about how I felt and then told me ?it makes her angry when I text her?. I never heard from her again. 

I don?t know what I did wrong. It was going amazing. Like so amazing. She had told her parents about me and was going to introduce me to all her friends. I would?ve been already if it wasn?t for the fact I couldn?t make her party.

She also doesn?t compliment me like she used to, she used to tell me I was perfect for her and that I was her dream guy, lately she has been telling me that I would look hot with tattoos and that I should get my neck tattooed and she?s been sending me men?s fashion stuff and telling me that I would look very hot if I rolled my pants up at the bottom and If I would wear rings on my fingers.

151,,13,c76i2u,24,"the backstory is that last weekend a few of us friends were together drinking and having a good time.  when it was getting late i asked friend A if he would drive me to my car since i rode with him to friend B's hotel room.  he agrees, but then leaves the room after having a quiet convo with B and in my mind at the time i didn't think he had left completely.

well you can guess that B took advantage of the fact that i was drunk and copped himself a nice feel here and there before i was finally able to get him to let me leave.  went to the parking lot, A's car is gone.  great.  i start walking to where my car is bc i'm sure as hell not gonna go back up B's room.

i guess B called A about me storming out bc A found me and told me to get in, a while after walking.  at that point i was too embarrassed to talk about it, so i didn't even ask where he went/why he left; i just let him drive me to my car then went home.

fast forward to yesterday, friends are wanting to get together again and i'm still feeling some type of way about the situation with B so i declined to stay in and drink by myself where i won't come to with some guy's hand down my pants.  after i say no in group chat, A calls me to ask if i have other plans--basically trying to figure out if i'm declining bc i'm doing something else.  i tell him no and he asks if he can hang out with me, which i say yes to bc i'm close with A and can actually trust him.  or so i thought.

we get to drinking and i tell him about last weekend and why i was walking when he found me and why i'd been acting weird and ghosting everyone all week and told him how bad i was feeling from it.  then.  then he tells me that he'd noticed B and me ""flirting"" and was getting annoyed by it.  (he never said anything about any perceived flirting at the time, nor do i feel like i was flirting with anyone. i just wanted to have fun with friends playing video games and stupid card games while drinking problems away.)  and then he told me bout B asking him if he could dip out bc he wanted to try and ""see what he could get"" out of me.  and A actually agreed by leaving bc he was ""so mad"" and ""so jealous"" that he was never ""brave enough"" to make moves on me first...

i am still so livid.  i threw him out of my place as soon as he told me that and haven't spoken to either of them since last night.

A's been blowing up my phone and sending long messages apologizing and saying that he knows he screwed up and wants me to forgive him for making a drunk mistake--the mistake being that he left knowing B's intentions.

155,,100,c72uac,323,"My girlfriend is a YouTube vlogger and it has undeniably been the source of some tension in our relationship, but we've been able to talk things out and make things work. My dad has especially been uptight about her being around with her camera and things really boiled over this past week when me, my girlfriend, and my family went on vacation to our Summer beach house in Lake Tahoe.

The first couple of days were fine. My girlfriend didn't vlog when my dad was around and she was being considerate of how he feels about the camera being on, but she still vlogged an awful lot when it was just me and her and sometimes my mom. But one day while we were all getting ready to go out to eat, I was in the bathroom. I won't go into too much detail, but let's just say that I wasn't having the most smooth bowel movement at the time. I was on the toilet for a while and my girlfriend was urging me to hurry up. It then reached a point where she was silent, save for some stifled giggling. I figured that she was most likely filming and trying to get some audio of me taking a dump, so I started yelling at her to turn the camera off. She claimed that she wasn't filming, but she was laughing while saying it and that confirmed to me that she was filming.

I was honestly really annoyed and disgusted that she wanted to film me taking a shit, so I finished my business, burst out the door, and started yelling at her to give me the camera. She ran away and she must've thought that I was joking because she was laughing the whole time, but I was really pissed off and I wanted to take her camera. I was chasing her around the house and things went really bad when she sharply turned a corner and ran into my dad, spilling his soda all over him in the process.

156,,5,c74lyy,5,"Background Story:  I?m in my 40?s now, but my parents divorced when I was 18.  My dad was already living abroad.   In their divorce, my parents didn?t want to sell off the homes and split the money.   They decided to leave it to me and my siblings, with my mom having power of attorney.   I?m not sure how formal is the paperwork is as it?s been over 20 years.   In my 20?s- I had a lot of resent towards my dad, and viewed the house as a way to justify his actions (choosing to have a successful career over being a good dad\husband).  I did not want nothing to do with that house, and left it for my mom to decide to do with him and care for it.   My early 20?s- I was nowhere mature enough to manage a mortgage either.  My mom?s siblings immigrated to the US, and ended living at the house at b\e cost, so it was a not really a big issue.  Other than my dad annoyed that I should be getting rental income.  In my 30?s-   I moved abroad overseas, so I did not want to think about it.  My mom who remarried, and my step-dad?s parents end living there until they passed of old age.   Step-dad, and step grandparents are good people and took really good care of the house and invested and did the remodel to house.   Again, my dad was annoyed that I wasn?t managing the property or taking rental income.   I didn?t need the money and it would?ve added more stress, esmpecially when I didn?t live in country.  I never made mortgage payments or paid property tax or any upkeep, maintenances or fixes to the property.  After my step-grandparents passed, it was rented out and my mom-stepdad keep the rental income.   The house mortgage is currently paid off with no bank debts.

Fast forward to present day.   I recently got divorced this past year with full custody of 2 year old daughter and moved back to the US.  Divorce has depleted me financially.  Currently living with my mother and step-dad, more because they are empty-nesters and my mom really wants to her grand daughter there, and me since I was living overseas for over 10 years and only got to see her once a year for 2 weeks.  The inherited house is currently being rented out to supplement mom?s income.

For my mom,  since my 20?s, she had always hoped I would move to that house and settle down, as it?s only 5 miles away from her.  She would never want me to sell it.   The house also generates her around $3k a month in rental income and allows her to only work part-time and do volunteer work.   She?s of retirement age now.

For my step-dad.   I do not know how he views that house.   They?ve been married for close to 20 years, he spent time and money remodeling, fixing and maintaining the house.

For my bio-dad.   He is disappointed in me in regards to the management of the property.   He?s upset with my mom (but they do not speak).   He feels that their agreement was never honored, and the house was intended to go to me (the other property to my siblings) and not to her and my step dad.  If he knew this how things would have played out, he would?ve sold everything and just divided things accordingly.

For myself.   I understand my dad?s position.  Before I could brush the responsibility off as I was living overseas and I think the house would have triggered a lot of tax issues.   Now that I am here,  I no longer have that excuse of not being able to manage the property.  I?m still unsure of the tax implications if I do formally transfer the deed to my name.   I really don?t want to take away $3k monthly income from my mom, but I?m no longer in position where I can subsidize her monthly income.   If I did take formal ownership of the house- I would like to find a way to compensate my mom-stepdad for money they invested into the property, but again-  the divorce bled me dry, so I don?t when I can repay them, or even know how much.   I also fear, that bringing this up my open a pandora?s box of issue between me and mom-stepdad and even my siblings up.  If I did take ownership of the house, I would only live there when my daughter starts elementary school or I would sell the house to move to another city with lower cost of living and use remaining funds to give to mom-stepdad and forward to my startup business project.
  

The Question:  What is the general opinion of reddit?  Am I entitled to the house if I never made any financial payments to the property?  IF I do take formal ownership of the property, how do I fairly compensate my mom and stepdad?

158,,29,c75936,8,"My girlfriend has this husky type mutt that tips the scales at around 85 lbs and thinks he's a human and the alpha in her house. Now I've been raised with dogs my whole life, but my dad always trained them well. I'm more of a cat person myself, but can absolutely tolerate dogs in general. When I started seeing how aggressive her dog was I mentioned that he's ""kinda bad"" and she got really emotional. She said she got him at a time in her life where she was working 3 jobs and didnt have time to really train him or anything, and now she treats him like a person, she knows he's bad but loves him and he's a part of her family. 

The dog (we'll call him D) will growl and bare his teeth when you touch him, even to her sometimes. He'll sit by the door where his toys are and guard them and growl and bark at you for trying to go outside. D will stand clearly in the way and if you try to walk by, he wont move and will bare his teeth, and if you try and move him he'll lash out. Not biting hard enough to break skin by any means, but it's kinda scary because one day he might really latch down. He'll stand right in front of you and beg for food, and she feeds him, but I wont, he wont obey a command to lay down or back up and when I tried to gently push him back he wouldn't budge, when I pushed harder to make him move he nipped at me. Now I'm not someone who's all for beating dogs or anything like that, but it was the first time he'd done it to me and I kinda freaked out and my natural reaction was to punch his snout. I know this isnt the right way to react, no need to tell me I'm way in the wrong for that, I know. But I'll be damned if some dog is going to think he's an Alpha over me. She got really upset with me for this, I didnt punch as hard as I could or anything, just enough to let him know I wont take that shit.

Now that we're starting to talk about moving in together, my greatest concern is this dog is going to be a serious point of contention. I'm getting to the point where I frankly hate D because he seems so untrainable, and is such a dick. I feel like if I tell her we will not live together until she figures out how to get control of her dog I might lose her. Once again she knows her dog's behavior is her fault, and she feels really guilty about it, but she also doesn't have the money for some fancy dog trainer or anything.

161,,480,c6yuo5,4122,"Hi reddit, 


So this is a weird one probably, I've always been a quite chubby child, but around a year and a half ago I've decided to do something about that and started working out and doing other sports, I'm playing Volleyball and I'm in my high schools cheerleading team. 

Around like 8 months ago my mom has started acting like I'm some sort of ""threat"" to her relationship with my stepdad [41M].

Yes, I've catched my stepdad staring at me few times and I think that's kinda gross but I had hoped she would talk to him about that, but instead she is mad at me.


At first she started teasing me with the fact that I'm lesbian, something she never really had an issue with before, said that I'm still the ""chubby"" girl and other mean things. 

Over time it has only gotten worse to the point where there are some serious restrictions on what I'm allowed to wear. For example, we've a pool, she absolutely doesn't want me to go swimming in it, because she doesn't want me to walk around in a swimsuit or a bikini. 

I'm not allowed to wear my gym clothes or any form of leggings, skirts or dresses or even my cheerleading outfit. 

At multiple occasions she has tried to hide or throw away clothes or make-up. Including Lululemons I've paid for with my own money. 

She always asks me when I'm getting a haircut again and tries to pressure me into my old short hairstyle by saying how unattractive my longer hair looks. (Fun fact: We are both blonde and have similar hair lengths)

Any  time we would get in a arguement I would try to end things with him but after a few days he would always beg me back and I would go. I know that sounds so terrible. It didn't make sense because he loved me more and better then any man ever has. He loved my kids and treated them like his own. I thought that I wasn't as happy as I should be.

163,,2,c777zx,2,"I have a mental disorder in which intense discomfort and reduced capacity for close relationships is the core symptom. I feel a tremendous amount of guilt for having involved myself with this girl, and in all honesty, anybody ever. She is aware of my diagnosis and has issues of her own, two of which are codependency and extreme emotions. She frequently proclaims both in person and via text how in love she is with me, how much I mean to her, and if she hasn't seen me in 2 days, how much she misses me. I believe her, and to some extent I love her too, but I don't think my kind of love is as strong as most people's. She likes to talk with me constantly and I prefer to be alone most of the time, and now that this feeling of suffocation and entrapment has manifested, it is only going to grow. I've been trying to ignore it but it makes me feel sick whenever she talks about things in the future.

We had our first real fight two days ago after she tried to pressure me into going out when I was too tired for it. She used guilt trips and other manipulation tactics to get me to go, and when I brought this to her attention (this was becoming a fairly consistent pattern), she immediately did a 180 and started apologizing profusely. I didn't let it go right away and after her initial panic calmed, we talked for a long time about the health of our relationship. We settled on that she would stop the manipulative behaviour, but if the relationship didn't feel good to me, I would end it. 

Today, she asked me if I wanted to get cheap concert tickets for an artist we both like. She said the concert was in november, and not wanting to admit that I was fairly certain we would break up before then, I agreed. I figured she could take a friend in that scenario because she bought both tickets herself. She then joked that I was stuck with her at least until november, and I pretended to laugh it off but I don't know if she was really joking or not. I think she might have been finding ways to pressure me into staying with her, but maybe that's just the paranoia talking.

I don't want to break up with her so soon after agreeing to stay together, not to mention she works part-time at the place where I work full-time so I'd probably have to see her again. I don't actively dislike being in this relationship and she's a lovely person aside from her bad social tendencies, but we're pretty much dating on borrowed time. We're not compatible. Doomed to crash and burn. I already told her we might be too different to make things work without forcing it, but she wants to try. I don't see the point in postponing the inevitable. That night I told her I'd try until I couldn't anymore, but I didn't realize I might already be at that point. I really don't want to break up 48 hours after reassuring her we would try again, but it seems stupid to wait for the sake of waiting.

I feel like the right thing to do in this situation depends on whether it's right for her or right for me. I'm lost and confused. What should I do?",How can I [19M] leave my emotionaly volatile girlfriend [17F] of 4 months without fucking too much shit up?,1.0
164,,23,c7438r,4,"Sorry for the wall of text to follow, but I wanted to give a balanced account of the situation so that I'm hopefully being fair to all involved.

For some context, my husband is attractive and very fit as he used to be in the military and is still athletic and active. He is a high-energy person who loves hiking, kayaking, and general outdoor sports. I often accompany him on these activities, but he gets impatient with me because I can't move as far or as quickly as he can. I just don't have his strength and endurance. I also enjoy hiking and kayaking, but I like to take them at a slower pace and relax and enjoy myself, whereas he wants to push himself to his limit and climb higher or paddle further than ever before.

I'm 5""6 and weigh 138 lbs. When we first met I weighed about 125. Not because I exercised or dieted, I was just younger and had a faster metabolism.

Over the last few years, I've been dealing with some painful back issues as well as anxiety/depression. I manage both with occasional therapy, yoga, and sticking to certain self-care practices, like making sure I get enough sleep every night and not forcing myself into situations or activities that aggravate either condition. For a while, I had a tendency to stress eat, but I've gotten much better about that and am teaching myself not to reach for the snacks when I'm overwhelmed. I've learned that letting myself get uptight about my appearance is not good for my mental health. I walk a lot and I try to work out 2-4 times a week, if my work schedule allows it. Mostly yoga and barre classes with occasional cardio and/or strength training sessions. My doctor approves of my diet and only recommended that I try to get more green vegetables. I already avoid most animal-based foods and try to minimize desserts, but if I'm out at a restaurant, I'm ordering fries because I like them more than salads. I'll admit that I have a sweet tooth but I work hard to limit my sugar intake. I'm a size 6 and I am comfortable with my body. I've always had a bit of a belly pooch, but I'm also a D cup and have a round butt, so I think that's where a lot of my body fat sits. I'm not signing any modeling contracts anytime soon, but I'm also not embarrassed to wear a bikini. I think I look pretty good and that my current diet/exercise routine is realistic for my lifestyle and budget. I'd be glad if I lost a few pounds, but I'm not going to compromise my mental health to do it. I actually eat healthier and exercise more now than ever before in my adult life. My goal is not hotness. My goal is  good health and body positivity, and I'm making progress towards that goal.

For 2-3 years now, my husband has been pushing me to lose weight and be more athletic. He wants me to go for a 20-minute run every day (I hate running with a passion) and makes comments when I eat any kind of dessert or any food he deems likely to make me gain weight. Once when we were out on a fun date night, I ordered a grilled salmon filet with couscous and he didn't approve! His argument is that he's worried I'll continue to gain weight and he won't be attracted to me anymore and will be tempted to be unfaithful. He says things like, ""You're about an 8 now and if you lost 10-15 lbs you'd be a 10."" He doesn't speak with callous dismissiveness when he says these things and he doesn't threaten me with infidelity, at least not directly. He seems genuinely distressed that he will lose his feelings of attraction towards me. He also says that my inability to keep up with his preferred pace during outdoor activities make him not want to bring me along.

I think his attitude and comments are manipulative and insensitive and I told him so. He said, ""I'm sorry, but I can't help how I feel. I'm attracted to thin, healthy bodies and I want a partner who is fit and takes care of themselves. I want to be attracted to you and only you and I'm really worried about developing an attraction for someone else if you end up gaining a lot of weight."" I pointed out that if we have kids in the next couple of years, as he very much wants to do, my body is not going to keep looking like this. To which he just says that some of his friend's wives had a ton of kids and they dieted, worked out, and looked great afterward. He has also said, ""Look, most guys feel the same way as I do, they just don't talk about it. I'm just being honest with you instead of lying to you."" I pointed out that I'm eating healthy and working out, and he responded, ""That's all meaningless unless there are results, and there haven't been results."" (I lost maybe 4-5 pounds last year and my weight has been stable at 138 lbs ever since.)

He says I need to lose weight so he can find me more attractive. I say his comments make me less attracted to him. It's taken a lot of the joy from going out together because I feel like I can't eat food that I enjoy when I'm with him. I end up sneaking treats like ice cream whenever he isn't around and I hate that feeling.

Our relationship is affectionate and warm otherwise. My anxiety and depression, which unfortunately coincided with his two years in a highly stressful grad school program, were very hard on both of us, but we're doing a lot better after a few months of couple's therapy. And yes, I did bring this up in our therapy sessions, but the therapist didn't really dwell on it.

168,,1,c75klc,3,"To start, I will provide some context: I started attending university about 10 years ago, during which I became close friends with a group on my course. Within this group was a guy and a girl, both of who I became very close with. The 3 of us used to spent a lot of time together while at University (just us 3), and eventually I started dating the girl. Around the same time, the guy we were both close to started dating my girlfriend's best friend. My relationship with my girlfriend continued for the rest of our time at University, and the 4 of us used to all spend a fair amount of time together.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a couple of years. My girlfriend broke up with me. I was really depressed at the time and I think she just didn't want to be with me anymore, which I can sort of understand now. However, it was a pretty tough split, and I did not react well at all.  After all, I had just moved 100 miles or so away from all of my family and friends and started a job in the same city she lived in just to be closer to her, which we both agreed that we wanted, and a week after I had moved into my new place she had split up with me. I became even more depressed after the split, as well as borderline suicidal because I was just unable to cope with what I was going through. I remember I did and said some stupid things because I just hadn't gotten over her. The split happened at the start of the year, and I sent her a valentine's card a month later telling her I missed her. Her parents bought us tickets to go see a show the Christmas before we split up, and I acted really awkwardly when my girlfriend tried to purchase my ticket back from me as if we still had a chance of going together still. I know in hindsight this is all stupid but I was madly in love with her and just could not deal with the fact that she had split up with me, especially after her asking me to move to live nearer to her.

&#x200B;

As they always do, things go better as time went on. I continued to see the guy friend I was close to at University, and him and my ex-girlfriend even met up a couple of times. Everything felt like it was again before me and my ex-girlfriend started dating, as if we were all simply just friends.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I started dating someone else (my current girlfriend), and moved back home to where she and all of my family lived. Since everything has happened, I've continued to see my male friend from University from time to time, sometimes on his own and sometimes with all of my University friends which includes him, my ex girlfriend, my new girlfriend, his girlfriend (my ex's best friend), my ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, etc. On all these occasions I've not felt like there was any 'hard feelings' so to speak. We all seemed to get along well whenever I've met up them. I've even just met up with my male friend and his girlfriend with just me and my new girlfriend, and again we've all got along fine as if there were no issues whatsoever.

&#x200B;

To the crux of the issue - I follow my male friend on Instagram, and through some unfortunate glitch I realized that my ex-girlfriend's best friend (who my male friend is dating) had gone out of her way to block me on the app. I had followed her previously (because I thought we were friends), but only realized I was blocked because of this glitch. I have never done or said a single thing wrong to her, and yet I feel that there's some probably some lingering ill will because of everything that happened when me and my ex-girlfriend split. Or it may be that she just doesn't want to see anything she posts because she still regularly meets up with my ex.

After a friend of mine realized that I was interested in a white guy,  I was told that only ""weird"" white men date/marry asian girls. She later explained that she meant weird as in ""constantly rejected by white women resulting in them having to resort to asian women"" and someone that was ""not that handsome, a little bit of a fetishist, had caught a case of yellow fever"" etc etc. 

I was a bit put off by her statement so I browsed the web and found something on reddit along the same lines of what my friend had said- people were saying that asian-white couples were almost always a combination of a ""weird"" white man and an asian woman, but never the other way around. Another thread had this generalization that there were only 2 types of white men in the world who would date an asian woman, and it was either someone who was particularly interested in the culture, or someone that was, once again, the ""weird"" white guy.

When the coworker took him to the first aid station he said ya anything to hang out with(my wife). Another coworker said that he is always staring intensely at my wife and never seems to be paying attention.

I told my wife after talking to her coworkers that this guy is insane, probably putting her in danger, and she needs to report him and get removed from interacting with him.  It convinced her to to talk to her professor and he has already started filing a complaint with his boss.  He also removed the guy from her lab group and told her that he would be attending labs with her to make sure that he doesn?t try to interact with her.

&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for almost three years.  We have a great relationship and enjoy a very healthy and active sex life.  I am six months pregnant with our first now and we're both very excited to be parents.  I have of course changed a lot physically in the last few months and my husband absolutely loves it.  He's never been so eager in all the time we've known each other.  It's been fine with me for the most part because my sexual appetite has absolutely been off the charts for the last couple of months and he has been more than happy to give me what I need.  I also kind of like knowing that he still finds me desirable even though there are times I feel really gross in my own body.

&#x200B;

After a particularly enthusiastic session last night, I asked if he's more attracted to me since I became pregnant.  He kind of sheepishly admitted that yes, he's been really turned on both by the changes in my body and in my sex drive lately.  He says he never had fantasies about pregnant women before and that when I told him I was pregnant he didn't really feel this way and was actually a little surprised by how desirable he found me when I was starting to show.

&#x200B;

Again, I generally consider this a good problem to have (we're honestly having the best sex of our relationship right now) but there are a few things I'm not sure on.

&#x200B;

1. Why does he fuck me this way now when he didn't before?  Our sex life has been good but will he lose this level of attraction after our child is born? How am I going to get this back without getting pregnant again?
2. Does he secretly have a thing for curvier women?  I know he likes tall women (I'm 5'11 but kind of lanky and have a more athletic build...or at least used to) so how do I know he doesn't have some kind of low key BBW thing?  I don't really want to gain weight just for the sake of his pleasure.
3. He LOVES my belly.  I am certainly fine with him enjoying some of the other parts that have grown recently and don't mind him touching, rubbing and even kissing my belly, but I'd rather he sees it as something that's more sweetly intimate than overly sexual.  I mean, that's our child in there.
4. Is it just weird that he has a thing for me in this state?  There are times I feel so grossed out by my own body and can't help but think, what's going on in his head right now?  Is this normal?
5. Should I even be complaining or do I have a good thing going that I should just be happy with?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for helping me out!  I guess the only real issue was helping me get over the idea that my husband wouldn't feel the same way about me after our child is born, combined with some long standing insecurities over my body.

&#x200B;

I thanked my husband today for being so supportive during a roller coaster time and reiterated that I'm really enjoying all the sexual energy he's been bringing.  He pretty much said he appreciates it from me just as much!  He doesn't have a pregnancy fetish or a BBW fetish and doesn't want me to gain weight.  He did say though that he thinks it's a huge turn on to look at me and see something we're building together happening inside of me and it shows him that our bond has never been stronger which also really turns him on.

That fucker has a way with words, I'm telling you.  So now that we're finished I wanted to thank everyone who chimed in with advice!

174,,4,c76crt,2,"Hey reddit thanks for being there for all my relationships advice/venting needs. First, I want to preface that my bf and my relationship has plenty of issues and this is just hitting the surface - but it?s a pretty prevalent issue and I?m down to hear other people?s perspectives. 

My bf and I started the relationship after being friends for years. We had a brief conversation about how the porn industry mistreats people. We were also pretty devout Christians who believed sex is for marriage, etc. etc. I kind of naively took from his as a ?no, I don?t watch porn.? 

Anyways, we were horny young people and I ended up giving my virginity to him before we even technically started dating. Later, a few months into us officially as boyfriend/girlfriend, I opened his phone while he was still sleeping/hung-over to call myself and find my phone. Surprise surprise the first thing that popped up was LOADS of porn. I was devastated. After I freaked out, we had a talk and he said he understood how he felt and he, who had been in a pastoral position, had seen it tear multiple marriages apart and was very sorry. I forgave him thinking now that it was in the open, we could move on. 

Two year later now, he?s got a porn addiction that?s surged during the time we?ve been together. He?s lied and hid it from me, given me the password to his phone and insta trying to prove that I can trust him, and then kicked me off after I found more porn on it (this pattern had continued on and off). Most recently, I found out that him and his friends shared a drop box where they were sharing girls? (many who he knew personally) nudes. This was the most livid I?d been - not because he hid it from me but because he would take any part of invading another persons privacy like that. I was wholeheartedly pissed for those girls. The only reason I stayed was because he admitted how horrible it was, said that he didn?t realize how many nudes were on there, he joined the Dropbox before we even started dating, that he took/shared none of those photos, and was going to delete it. Even after that he continued to follow nude pages on insta. I can?t get as mad at him for that because at least those girls are willingly posting photos. 

I still have very negative views about porn and feel like I can tell when he?s been watching it because of how much more distant he acts. That being said, I also know a majority of guys watch it. Sometimes I wonder if the issue is just that we have different views on what is/isn?t okay in a relationship and if we?re just not that compatible? He always says he gets why I feel the way I do, but he keeps watching it. Tbh this issue has messed with my self-esteem a lot. I frequently wonder if it?s my fault especially since it got worse after we started dating. I feel like I get jealous a lot and wish I looked like the girls he was looking at. 

No hate to my homies out there who watch porn/are or aren?t struggling with an addiction. All the love and support to you. This is just my perspective and how it?s affected my relationship, and I?m open to hearing fresh perspectives. 

Tl;dr - Bf has a porn addiction that?s surged during our relationship (by his admission). He has a tendency to lie and hide it. I would feel way more comfortable if he didn?t watch porn and he says he wishes he didn?t either. Recently found other girls nudes on his computer that he says his friends sent him.

Yesterday we went to a party and she asked me to dance, but I'm really shy and didn't wanted to. Her friends told me they were going to take some photos with her and I was fine wit that, I finally got the courage to dance and waited for her to come back from the photos with her friends but then I saw her dancing with them, this got me real angry, so I decided to go out and take some air, one of her friends went outside and told me my girlfriend was looking for me so I went in and found her, she told me she had been looking for me and I told her I was finally there and wanted to dance, but then she told me she had already danced and didn't wanted to anymore, this got me even angrier so I told her I had go leave, we said goodbye and then I went home. I couldn't sleep at all, thinking where I went wrong, thinking it was my fault, what I should've done, I even thought of breaking up with her. I'm normally not like this but lately I've been having more and more thoughts like this.

Anyways the last time I dated someone and he found out he got angry which resulted in a huge fight. Have never seen him act this way. Swearing, saying mean things etc. This left a bruise on our relationship for a while and I ended up having to leave the guy in question for peace of mind.

Now we are close again. It?s starting to feel like old times. I know he doesn?t approve of me dating yet because he wants me to focus on school and building a solid career. Which I have been doing successfully. 

So I met someone great that I have a lot in common with. I don?t know what?s going to happen but we plan on spending a lot of time together. The chemistry is there and I feel this is a genuine guy.

178,,6,c72stx,4,"Hi everyone. 

First of all, sorry if somenthing is mispelled, english isn't my main languague.

I been looking this sub's post in a while, this is my first entry, and I really need some outside opinions of my situation.

I'm in a 3 years relationship (which we have a break up about year ago). I can't say it's perfect, but I clearly love the way we do things, except for this particular situation...

My girlfriend has a tendency of whenever we have a small problem, she likes to do stuff that she states as ""proof if I really will do anything to save the relaationship"".

It's hard to explain, but I guess i'll use last night's moment.

Yesterday, my gf and I went to a plaza to hang around and watch a movie. Everything was going normal as usually, asking how was her day on work and stuff. 
Both being young and pretty active, we wanted to go to a Hotel to do our bussiness. 

About 7:00 pm I started to get a headache, which I can guess it was for some morning stress at work. I told her that I wasn't feeling well, so she gave me some pills to try to aliviate my unconfortable moment.

We went to the cinema and the pills didn't help much at all. When we where going outside the plaza, she asked me if we where still going to do our bussiness, I didn't reply because I wasn't feeling good yet. She keeps asking and then I agreed, but she just said ""No, I don't want to go there if I needed to ask you many times"".

I insisted that we should go, because we won't have much time later, being his new job at late shift the reason...

All the way back to the Taxi Stop (yes, I don'tvhave a car and we use taxis or Uber sometimes) she was quiet, we didn't talk at all and I didn't know how to handle that, I tried to talk to her but she was sharp as a knife.

Midway to her house, she just texted somenthing on the phone and went out of the taxi. 

She then texted me back that I showed her how much I cared about her (sarcastically) and that she expected me to ""run for her"".

I didn't do it because it's not the first time that she does that kind of Novela scene and I don't want to endorse her to do that.

In my opinion that's childish and inmature, because she rather make a typical romcon scene, no mattwr if that could cause her to be in the streets at night alone.

That night, when I arrive to my home, I just grab my bottle of whiskey and cigars (I haven't smoked in a year, until last night) and just stood on the porch drinking and thinking.

180,,7,c74egk,2,"So, I?m 20 and my boyfriend of 5 years is 21. We?ve been dating since high school, he?s been my best friend since we met. But, the last couple of years have really just been draining for me. 

I?ll start by saying that he?s not romantic AT ALL. He never plans dates or buys me flowers. He also is not sexual at all. I?m a very sexual person, I probably have a higher sex drive than most girls. Because of his unwillingness to reciprocate, it has turned my insecurities into severe social anxiety to the point where I can?t even leave the house without crying. He has called me a slut and a whore multiple times when I have tried to initiate sex, saying girls shouldn?t act that way. Despite him saying this, I know he watches porn. In fact, there have been nights where I have begged for sex, then gone on his phone the next day for something normal, like to google something, and I?ll see the spam ads that pornhub pops up with. I?ve told him multiple times that I don?t like him to watch porn, so now he?s figured out how to use a private browser to watch it. 

I don?t know where I went wrong here..in high school we had a very good sex life. We were literally known for being the annoying couple that are all over each other. Now, he does not touch or kiss me. 

Another major thing is that he comes home from work and immediately goes into our bedroom, lays down, and starts to watch YouTube. This is an every day thing, nothing different. I feel like I have to beg for his attention. He has told me that it?s because he feels trapped in our home. We moved in with my father last year after our engagement to save money for a house and the wedding. We have a relatively large home and I thought it would work out with us being here. But, since living here we haven?t saved a dime, and my boyfriend has just become more of an asshole. He constantly talks about my father, saying mean things even though I told him this bothers me. 

The main thing I?m so concerned with is the lack of sex and romance. There is absolutely none here. We have fun, lots of fun, but it?s more of a friendly relationship than it is romantic. He never even touches me sexually, or even hugs me in public. He says I smother him and that he?s claustrophobic. The lack of physical connection with him is driving me crazy. 

Lately, I have been more worried about how this is affecting my own mental health. As I said before, I can barely leave the house because I am so insecure with my body. When I go out with him, I compare myself to every single girl I see and that usually ends with me feeling terrible about myself and wanting to go home. When this happens, he gets angry with me and tells me that being insecure is the most unattractive thing about me.

We communicate pretty well too. We?ve been together for almost 2 months, and in (almost) all other relationships I?ve been in in the past, I feel intense excitement when ex?s have texted me, and I got very aroused in bed with almost all of my ex partners.

I feel calm and happy when I?m with him, and I really enjoy spending time with him, we have many shared interests; but I?ll be very honest - when it comes to sex, unless I smoke weed or drink a bit of alcohol beforehand, it is otherwise very hard for me to get aroused in bed with him. And even when I?m under the influence of something, there?s a discomfort inside me. It is not that he doesn?t know how to pleasure me - he does know how and we?ve communicated about our bedroom habits - I just feel uncomfortable doing sexual things with him specifically in bed.

I moved away a few years ago and she was there to help me pack up and although I have not seen her since, we have always stayed close through phone calls or texts.

She told me that the offer was intriguing.  She brought that up more than once.  I told her I was always here for her to which she said she hoped she wasn't offending me, I was not offended.  She said she had always wondered if I was interested in her (I told her I was) and the day she helped me pack, she was secretly hoping I would kiss her before she left.  This blew me away.

Then we talked about some other situations that happened and she was hoping I would pick up on her flirtations, which I did.  We texted for almost 4 hours and she ended the evening by telling me she had not had that much fun in a long time.    We were both glad the cat was out of the bag.

187,,34,c73s73,9,"About a week ago my gf mentioned that she was going out of town this weekend for a professional networking convention. She told me the convention was a obligation and didn't really want to go. I thought nothing of it. 

When she got there, she met some friends at the convention and they decided they were going to go drinking. When she told me this, I let her know that I thought it was a bad idea to go drinking with people she doesn't know in a city she's not familiar with. She responded by saying that she will only have one drink and that she will be extra safe. I told her that I still thought it was a horrible idea. I stressed that I didn't approve of it, and it made me uncomfortable, but I can't control her actions. She decided to go out anyway.

After this, I thought about breaking up with her because of the situation she was putting herself in. It was an unsafe situation that I was uncomfortable with, yet she went anyway despite my feelings. Also, since I work night shift, I was worried the entire night at work. 

Later that night (around 2 AM), I gave her a call. When she picked up, she told me that she had just arrived back at her hotel and she  was pretty drunk. I decided to break up with her because (1) she lied about how much she was going to be drinking and (2) she disregarded my anxiety about the situation and the fact that I would be worried. 

I've been feeling very guilty since this happened. A lot of friends told me that this might have been an overreaction and that I should have used this as an opportunity to give her another chance. I'm still very unsure if she made an innocent mistake or if what she did really crossed the line.

189,,75,c6uvx5,33,"So I met this guy on tinder (he?s in Canada and I?m about 2hr 30min away in the states) about a month and a half ago, and right away I found out he?s a hardcore Christian and he found out I?m atheist. It?s worth mentioning that I?m very much so not a virgin and he is in fact still a virgin and waiting until marriage, never did anything sexual ever before but I actually got him interested and wanting to try some stuff, which he did do and actually enjoyed it all. Anyways, he was willing and interested to continue knowing our differences because he thought it would make for interesting conversation and give us a lot to talk about. I was also willing because I?m open minded and religion isn?t that big of a deal to me, I?m mostly indifferent when it comes to dating people who are religious.

We met up twice so far (I know it?s not much but it?s because of the distance and we are both busy) and both times things went very well. Infrequently, our differences in beliefs would be brought up and it would get a little frustrating not understanding each other?s opinions but things were always resolved, or so I thought.

He texted me tonight saying this ***?There?s no easy way to this and I have to be totally honest with my thoughts right now before more feelings are hurt. All this is hard for me to say because I like you. All that stuff I said and did in the past few weeks was real. That being said the one main thing that stands in the way of us moving on is our beliefs. My faith is too important for me and its more important than anything else to me in this world.. more than friends, family, career etc. And my whole life and purpose revolves my faith.?*** He said he had taken time to re-evaluate because things between us were moving quickly. 

I then asked to talk on the phone and he called me and proceeded to tell me that the differences in our beliefs make us incompatible. He thought things might work out okay and that he could have his beliefs on one side and relationships on the other, and they could meet in the middle, but decided that his religious beliefs and relationship with jesus are more important and he needs a relationship to follow the mold of his beliefs. He also said that if I chose to become a Christian that he would want to continue a relationship with me and that is the only way he would continue one.

Also worth mentioning that he is very much so what I look for in a partner and we really did connect, we get along and have a good time together. I have a hard time opening up but I just felt really comfortable with him. Obviously his religious beliefs became a problem now, but I was indifferent about them before, as religion was never a big deal to me in relationships.

I wouldn?t ask him to change his beliefs in order to be with me, and he wouldn?t anyways, so how can he suggest that for me? And why am I considering looking into Christianity? Is that silly? Is it worth it just for a guy? I wouldn?t say I?m sacrificing who I am, because being atheist isn?t a personality trait of mine it?s just something in the background that I don?t think much of. I really do like him and like being around him, is looking into Christianity worth it? Is he actually shitty for wanting me to change to fit his mold if I want to be with him? I can?t understand why being myself isn?t enough. 

TL;DR As an atheist, is it worth trying to be a Christian in order to continue a relationship? Or is it an unfair compromise to have to change myself to fit what he wants me to be?

EDIT: I need to clarify that he didn?t outright ask me to become Christian. He said he realized that it?s important to him that his significant other has the same beliefs as him. I asked if I was a Christian if he would continue a relationship with me, and he said yes but that he would want me to convert so that I can feel the fulfillment of a relationship with jesus. He didn?t ask me to convert for him.

EDIT: I know it may seem silly for someone that I just recently met, but we really connected. I rarely ever connect with anyone the way that I connected with him. And this is really difficult for me because I?m extremely indecisive and I have an unbelievably hard time letting go.

EDIT: My parents are Christians, though not over the top. They rarely attend church anymore but they do believe in god. I grew up going to church, even if I didn?t want to be there. So I wouldn?t say I grew up Christian but I did grow up around it?s influence. Perhaps I became atheist in the first place because i felt rebellious and never willingly went to church so I basically just learned to dislike everything about being religious solely because I didn?t want to be there and my parents forced me to go.",My (22f) significant other (25m) doesn?t want to continue a relationship with me unless I become a Christian...I?m atheist,0.78
190,,2,c75gfi,1,"So I wrote this post a few months ago:

[**Game over, she's engaged...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b64ck7/game_over_shes_engaged/)

&#x200B;

**The TLDR of that was:** 

I have a 20 year friendship with a female  coworker.  I never saw her romantically until she broke up with a ""bad"" boyfriend around four or so years ago. During that break up I started having feelings for her.   I almost told her how I felt at that time but in my indecision I waited too long and before I knew it, she was with another guy.  New guy was not great in the last year so she and I started to heavily hang-out and ""friend date"" a lot because according to her I ""like to do fun things and he didn't.""  This wrecked me mentally.  She finally broke up with new guy three months ago and I was determined to do something.  Then about a week after breaking up, old ""bad"" boyfriend ""surprise"" proposed to her out of the blue and she accepted.  My question was what to do at that point.  **Oh yeah, I'm severely handicapped and wheelchair bound, she's not.** My dating pool is a dry desert.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Here's what happened since:**

I was devastated to say the least.  There was a good month and a half of contemplating my place in life and the universe.  A few weeks in, I did ask her how it all went down and she said her and old boyfriend had been texting back and forth a bit, but nothing romantic.  When she went to her parents the weekend after breaking up with new boyfriend, old boyfriend was waiting for her on one knee in their kitchen.  She said he wanted to get married like within a week or two and she was like nope, gotta be at least 6 months (remember, they had dated for nearly 10 years previously).  He agreed and they started planning the wedding and her #1 priority was making sure I could be in the wedding (because of my wheelchair).  Ugh.

&#x200B;

I eventually did ask her ""why did you accept?"" and she said he was a like ""changed person.""  He was so changed that she said it was almost annoying.  Like a guy who was very aloof now completely open, caring, and sharing.  **I figured that was that and decided to move on in my life from her.**  I subtly switched offices so I wouldn't have to see her as much and avoided her when I could.  I curtailed messaging her at work and stopped replying to texts immediately.  I was still cordial, helpful and nice, but I definitely put up some physical and emotional distance.  Friend dates were definitely not going to happen, even when she hinted at going out once.  For me, it would be just too weird and difficult doing that when she's practically married.  Plus I figured she'd show up with the fianc? and I wanted nothing to do with that.

&#x200B;

But guess what? Something crazy happened.  **I found peace and happiness** (or at least contentment).  Looking back, during the years when I had feelings for her, I felt shitty on a daily basis.  [Someone in the other thread pinpointed it for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b64ck7/game_over_shes_engaged/ejjaylv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) \-- I was a LIAR.  Everyday I remained her friend and had these hidden deep feelings I was lying to her.  I was a bad person and I was too much of a wimp to go after my dreams.  I constantly, and I mean constantly, hated myself and my life.  After the proposal, those feelings went away.  Yes, I was devastated for quite a while but once I got (mostly) through that, I noticed I didn't feel like a liar anymore.  It was as if her engagement freed me from ""hoping"" to be with her since it was no longer a possibility -- isn't that crazy?!

&#x200B;

**So what happened next?**  One day a couple weeks ago she shows up to work without the ring.  I didn't even notice.  Later on, I was talking to her on the phone about work stuff and at the end of the conversation she says ""Oh, by the way, I'm unengaged. Talk to you later!""  I was like ""Hold on! What?"" She said basically he reverted back to his old self.  He accused her of not being attentive enough and he was paranoid about her level of commitment.  He made her feel like crap and went back to his old routines of using mind games to get the advantage in the relationship.  This caused arguments and finally he said if that was the way she feels, maybe they should go their separate ways.  She called his bluff and gave back the ring. She claims she is relieved it's over and doesn't act upset at all.

&#x200B;

**So now, I'm back to being a liar.**  I feel like I ~~need~~ have  to tell her or make a move.  No guts, no glory.  If you sit on the bench, you'll never hit a home run (I could go on and on).  I'm almost 100% sure she's not interested in me that way but I don't think I can go through the rest of my life asking ""what if?""  

&#x200B;

**My questions to you are how to do it? What do I actually say?**  Do I write a long heartfelt letter confessing all?  Do I make some grand romantic gesture and if so like what? Do I send a text and write something short like ""Hey! Would you ever be interested in going on a romantic date for fun!?""  Do I go on another friend date with her and say something there or grab her hand and see what she does (I'm not really able to hug, pull her in close, or go in for a kiss since I'm in a wheelchair). **It's been a couple weeks now -- how long should I wait?  When she says ""no thanks"" is that it or is there anything else I can do?**

I broke up with her because I thought she was needy and I just wasn't cut out for a relationship. I like doing just about everything alone, I don't need people a whole lot. At work and my family is enough. I don't talk a whole lot. I don't have the same interests as most people, I don't care for music, sports, food, romance, and etc. I don't dislike those things I just don't have an interest in them.  I do about the same thing everyday. I can eat the same food everyday and the only reason I don't is because I know it's know weird and maybe not healthy. I do try to eat very healthy though. I like having the same routine. Bed by 9pm, wake up at 6am, gym 6:15am, 7:15am shower, work at 8:30am-5pm, and an hour or two to work on projects. I left out a lot obviously. I like to focus on my physical and mental health. When I dated her I completely changed this. I did whatever she wanted. I still worked out a lot less frequent and ate way worse. I was sleeping at all different hours. I don't like being in large crowds or around people I don't know. I always have stuff to do. I'm never bored, I'm always working on something or studying something. I thought everyone was like this until I got to college.

So those things I can kinda see make me look like I have Asperger's, but other stuff I'm pretty normal. I like keeping my stuff clean, but it can be disorganize and such. I don't feel smart, actually really dumb. It takes me a long time to learn stuff but if it interests me I will try really hard and then I usually understand it better than other people. No one else has ever thought I had Asperger's. 

I changed all this to date her and I did miss it. I was usually nice about it but in my head it was killing me. I would tell her would I liked to do and then she would tell her friend or family and they would call me a robot. I really thought after a while I would come to like it and change. I really just don't see the value in a romantic relationship. Sure it's lonely without it, but its also kinda stressful worrying about someone else and being on there schedule.

200,,6,c76eq0,0,"I?ve known this girl since middle school. We started dating at the beginning of 8th grade (2010) and lasted about a year. We broke up because to me it seemed like she wasn?t taking us seriously and kind of treated me like crap. I still really liked her though because she was my first girlfriend where we lasted quite some time and I lost my virginity to her. She also lost her virginity to me. It took us about 8 months to actually have sex. However after I broke up with her, she said that she was actually in love with me and wanted to get back together but I had already started moving on. I was talking to another girl at the time she was claiming to love me but it was already to late.. a few months passed and she messaged me again. We started talking and eventually ended up becoming friends with benefits for a while, even though she claimed to be ?hurt? from our breakup before. 
Then during the middle of high school (2013), she started talking to my best friend (at the time) who we both knew was kind of a man-slut who only tries to have sex with girls . I?m guessing that she either forgot or was fooled by him but they started ?liking? each other and both asked me for approval before they can date. I said ?no? to both because I obviously haven?t gotten over her yet, but they ignored my answer and dated. They only lasted about 2-3 months together.

I recently got back with her (it?s complicated) during mid 2017 and have lasted until now. However, just a couple of weeks ago I had asked her about her experiences with her ex?s just to find out that she actually had sex with my best friend when they dated. I?ve asked her a couple of times before then but she had always told me that she never had sex with anyone else. She just decided to be completely honest with me until recently. Keep in mind that they only lasted like 3 months and had sex, she said she did it like 15 times with him. While it took me 8 months and we did it probably like 100 times. 

I know that the amount of times she did it shouldn?t really matter but she did it with him 15 times and it bothers me! I am also aware that we weren?t dating when she did it with him but I can?t seem to get over the fact, especially since it was my best friend at the time.

When I asked her yesterday to be ready at 8, she said let me confirm.

I was kinda dissapointed in her and just said okay cool. 

She comes back few hours later and says can we put a pin on today for now? I'm terribly sorry and and I know I'm an asshole I'm sorry. It's not intentional. 

I said what's wrong. 

She said, I mean I don't mean to upset you or for you to think something. 

I said, I'm asking about what happened today. 

She said I have a test soon and I'm tired to go out honestly :D. 

10 minutes later she sends me a picture and says  ""that's me :D""  picture is of a tired person in bed all day

At that point I was dissapointed, felt disrespected since this is third time she flakes.

He's a divorcee with 50/50 custody of his two kids (6,3) and I've never been married, no kids. Majority of the time we get along great, but every few months he drinks too much and we end up fighting. I try to be be compassionately and understanding of everything he's been through, because it has been a lot, but I am constantly compared to the sins of his past relationships (with his ex wife, ex in-laws, and parents). 
The other night, out of the blue, he drunkenly told me to go home. I was too tipsy to drive so opted to sleep on the couch instead. The next morning he is hungover, and tells me the same thing, go home, which I do. I'm upset and tell him so, but I don't get a real apology. Instead I'm told that sometimes he's a drunk asshole and to deal with it, he's got kids to raise.  I'm pissed, so I tell him that it's not my fault what other people have done to him, and I don't want to have a fight I front of his kids, so I wasn't coming over that night. Which turns into I have no regard for his kids because I haven't seen them in over two weeks. I was out of town visiting family for two weeks, so there was no physical way I could have seen them. My first opportunity to see them was the night we were fighting. We ended that night both upset, him that I wasn't there and me because he keeps lumping me together with his ex and parents as never there for him. I had sent the last message, So the following day I haven't heard anything from him. I thought he was still mad and decided to let him text first because I hadn't done anything wrong in my opinion.
 The following morning my roommate sends me a screengrab of a message my boyfriend sent saying he was blocking her number too and good luck in the future. Which is when things take a turn for the worse. I discovered that my phone is messed up and I didn't receive any messages from him. I got group texts, so I didn't realize anything was wrong. As soon as I discovered this I called him from my other roommates phone to explain that I wasn't trying to ignore him, I thought he wanted space. He has his kids this weekend, so he didn't stay on the phone long. I immediately sent an apology email and social media messages explaining what happened with my phone, and that I wasn't intentionally ignoring him. I apologized, but have gotten no response. I know he read at least one of the messages because Facebook let's you know if someone has seen it or not.

208,,0,c76152,0,"For as long as I?ve known this girl I always had the feeling she wanted more from me than just friends. After all, when she became single she?s the one that tried hard to get to know me better and hang out. She tried turning things sexual months after becoming friends but I held her off for close to two years. When we had sex a few months ago it wasn?t a big deal at all but when she explained that night to me it came off as she had planned to end up in bed with me and told me I was her only guy friend she?s ever been with. 

A bit over a month ago I mentioned that I might be moving and later that night she cried to me saying people always leave her and how she felt lonely. We ended up at her place in bed and she tried sleeping with me but I had no condoms so we cuddled and talked. She sounded genuinely hurt when she said ?how could you even consider leaving me? You?ve always got to stay with me? in addition to telling me that I was hers and her explaining how great we are together. The next morning we just hung out until the afternoon and she wanted me to hangout later but I couldn?t. A day later I brought up that night and she ignored me so I told her how I felt. She blamed it all on being drunk when I?ve been around her enough to know she wasn?t and said I?ve only ever been a friend. Not once had she said emotional things like this to me. 

Since then we haven?t really talked. Maybe talked twice in 6 weeks or so but nothing that lasted more that a few messages. Recently she messaged me asking how I was and it seemed like she emphasized it by calling me her friend. Personally, I think she?s an incredibly confused individual with emotionally unavailability issues from being hurt in the past. Unfortunately she always goes back to guys that took her for granted because I think she has validation issues. My main problem is how she acts like I?m just a friend after trying for so long to sleep with me, keeping women away from me and trying to hold my hand when we go out. With all my other girl friends there?s no question that they?re just friends, but with this girl I think there?s an attraction whether or not she wants to acknowledge it. Maybe it?s her emotional unavailability suppression feelings or she?s just clueless. I know she doesn?t want to lose me but I feel like if I can never be more than friends with her then there?s no point in keeping her around. Based on a rather brief description of our history, so you think ending it with her is the right move? I know it will hurt her a lot, but I was hurt for several weeks and I?m seeing this as an option now.

209,,0,c74g8n,1,"So, I met her right here on Reddit about five months ago. Things started great. We joked, we were sweet, we were supportive of each other, we had the same dreams and ambitions. We live in two different countries and we almost had plans to meet.

About two weeks ago she started getting distant. One day she tells me she needs a couple of days to think about herself. Ok, I said. It was hard, but I gave her space. She said she would have talked with me on day three. But on day three she said she could not do the long distance thing and blocked me on WhatsApp. I was crushed.

But not beaten. I wrote her an email where I told her how much I loved her, all my feelings, and told her the fact that I was willing to move there. Yes, because in all this time I never actually told her I loved her. I wanted to tell her in person, or I don't know, I was stupid, very much so.

Anyway, she comes back, she says she loves me too, and then she starts making some sort of excuses (at least I think so) where she can't talk. This until two days ago, where she blocks me again and sends me an email telling me she is not herself, she is in a haze, or things like that.

I asked her if we can still be friends, if this is really over, and she said yes. But I would like something more. I mean, having her as a friend would be the lowest form of consolation prize, but still. I want her back. I told her to give me a couple of weeks because now I cry every time I see a message from her. I want to cry every time I remember her.

What should I do? 

I mean, I have an idea: what if I wrote her another email, thus breaking the radio silence I asked for, telling her to think about it a couple of weeks and then she will tell me if she wants me back? I seriously would do anything for her, despite having met her just five months ago.

210,,25,c6wtvi,20,"**TLDR: Husband decided to quit his job working for his family business and join the military, upheaving our lives. 3 years later, husband decides he doesn?t want to re-enlist because he is tired of the military. This was a last minute decision and we are not financially able to afford a place to rent. Our only option is to both move back in with our parents so we can save enough to buy a home. Neither parent is willing to take in our pets so we are forced to rehome all 3 of them. We have less than 3 months left before we have to move. I am extremely bitter and resentful. **


He and I have been married for 6 years, before that we dated for 3 years. He is my high school sweetheart.. We have one child, a 5 year old who is the joy of my life. 

My husband is active duty military but is getting out of military in 3 months. 3 years ago, before he joined the army, he worked at a company his family owned but was unhappy and unmotivated with his work. There were days he would call off saying he was sick but would blow off the day playing games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends. 

During this time I had two jobs but still, money was tight especially with my husband calling off when he felt like it. There were months we were late on rent and were barely making it. When he decided he wanted to quit his job and join the military, I was very upset and afraid. He told me he felt that it was his calling and that we would be taken care of so I went along with it because I wanted him to be happy and it seemed to make sense. We broke our lease, I quit my jobs and I moved back in with my parents while he went to basic training. We ended up getting stationed at a very small, remote military base and my husband is gone 2 weeks out of the month for training. He has never been deployed.  I don?t know what he expected to be doing but he apparently hates the reality of his service and refuses to consider re-enlisting. 

During our time living on the military base, I went back to school and got my bachelors degree. I have not worked because there are no jobs aside from minimum wage part time jobs and the cost of child care would  end up costing more than half of my pay. I dedicated my time to school, raising our child, and maintaining our home.

When my husband told me that he would not be re-enlisting I felt lost. When he told me that his plan was to go back to working for his families business, I became extremely frustrated. I have already given up everything for him when he decided the military was ?his calling? and now he wants to go back to exactly what he was doing before. What is worse is that we are in NO way financially prepared to go back to civilian life. His job with his families business does not offer any healthcare. Our option is for us to both move back in with our parents for 1 year while he works so we can save up enough to buy a home. Doing this means we will have to rehome all 3 of our pets because neither of are parents are willing to take them in. This fact is destroying me as I am deeply attached to my pets, they are a part of me.

I am at the point where I can hardly speak to him without it turning into a fight. I am so anxious about the future and hurting all the time, I?m trying to rehome our pets and he has done nothing to help me. He spends nearly 100% of his free time playing games on the computer with his friends. There is more resentment than love at this point. 

What holds me back from leaving him is that despite all this I do love him. Something about him just draws me in and I care for him deeply. I have invested nearly 10 years of my life with him. I also worry what a divorce will do to us and our child. I?m afraid my husband will not handle a divorce with maturity for the sake of our child. I?m afraid for our child who is so wonderful and doesn?t deserve to go through this. I just don?t know how much more I can take. I don?t feel secure or appreciated with my husband. I am deeply unhappy. I can hardly bring myself to touch him anymore even though I am still physically attracted to him. I am just lost.

My questions are, Should I stay and try to salvage this unhappy marriage? Is there hope that my husband could become the partner I need him to be? If not, how can I handle a divorce without it becoming hateful between us?",I(27F) want to divorce my husband(28M) but I am afraid.,0.95
211,,4,c76yye,2,"Posting this on reddit on behalf of a friend. 

So I have been seeing this girl for about two months now, we have yet to define the relationship. We started as FWB but now it?s gotten a little more complicated, we hang out outside of having sex, watch movies together, cuddle and just enjoy spending time with each other. 

So we have the same friend group and no one knows that we?re hooking up except for her best friend. In our friend group is a guy that she used to hook up with for about a month then they decided that they didn?t think it was a good idea to continue. Recently she broke up with her boyfriend, that?s when we started hooking up, well actually we started hooking up right before they broke up. 

Anyway, a week ago she decided to have friends over to her house for a casual night of drinking, including her ex FWB (who she also hooked up with while dating her ex boyfriend). Before I even got there she texted me saying that she didn?t want him to find out that we were hooking up, so she asked if I could pretend to leave when everyone else left and then come back ten minutes later so ex FWB wouldn?t find out. I was a little frustrated but agreed if that meant we could hang out that night. 

So as the night goes on she gets a little more drunk than expected and ends up passing out on the couch. Ex FWB takes her to bed, when he goes outside I wake her up and tell her that I?ll be back in ten minutes and to make sure to let me in because with her apartment you have to be buzzed in. 

So I pretend to leave with ex FWB and come back ten minutes later. I try to call her phone but it?s either turned off or dead, so I try to buzz in for about five minutes but nothing. I leave frustrated, it?s late and I?m drunk and it takes forever and a lot of money to find a Lyft. I send her a text saying that I?m going home because she didn?t let me in. 

The next morning I wake up to a bunch of texts from her. Initially they were apologetic but as we started talking more she flipped it and said that I should have taken her keys, I told her I didn?t feel comfortable taking her keys and she said there were other options and that it wasn?t her fault. 

I?m feeling a little upset/annoyed but I?m not sure if I really have the right to feel this way since we haven?t defined the relationship.

212,,6,c75i0k,3,"I have been dating ?Adam? for 7 months. During the first couple months, I really thought I hit the jackpot. Not only is he physically good looking, he is also punctual and sweet. We have common interests  and we dislike the same people.  However, as our relationship progresses I now realize that I can no longer pursue this.

 If you think someone in your life is super cheesy, Adam will give them a run for their money. Since day one, Adam has been smothering me with comments about how beautiful I am and how much he loves me and giving me a list of places he wants to kiss me (geographic locations, not places on my body :) ). It is so much worse than it sounds. I would copy paste the text messages but Adam?s friends use reddit so I can?t.  I thought it was sweet at first, but it got old real fast. I figured that maybe Adam was just doing this because he thought that this is what girls want, but I have come to learn that it is his personality and he is proud of it. He is also very apathetic about social issues because they don?t affect him directly and that is a huge turnoff for me, even just for a high school relationship. And lastly, as I much I hate to say it, I am just not in love with him anymore. Going on dates feels like a chore and I find myself waiting to get home. I feel like the shittiest person alive for this because I?m lying to him. 

The thing is, Adam thinks I?m his soulmate. He has talked about us moving in together after high school, getting married, and even told me he?d like for us to be together when we?re in our 50s. I don?t want to break his heart when he realizes those things will never happen. He also didn?t ?do anything? , so it?s not like I can reference a specific incident, like I?ve done in past relationships.

213,,0,c74m66,1,"So we have been dating for almost half a year and we are both quite introverted but we both come out of our shells depending on the situation and group we hang out with. After two months of being together I have already introduced him to my other friends group that he hasnt met yet and they get along great. We share a common group of friends but he also has a completely other one aswell which is the one ive been dying to meet since he keeps on hanging out with them and also keeps on talking about how great they are.
I have in no way been pressuring him to introduce me but i think its a bit weird that he hasnt yet. The thing is he has been hyping it up so much and kept on saying ?i cant wait for you to meet them and you will get along with them? but he wanted to introduce me at this party of one of the group members i guess which im ???? about because it never happened it was supposed to be in may. He hangs out a shitton of times with them and he had so many opportunities to introduce me we were literally in the same place at the same time but he isnt for whatever reason. I asked him about it once like a couple weeks ago why he wont introduce me and he said ?im worried you guys wont get along? and i just said ?we don?t necessarily need to get along i just want to know that other side of you aswell i dont need to become best friends with them? and he just nodded it off.
Now im just like, alright cool so i guess i will never get to know them and i won?t be able to come along on most days when you have plans but id like to see you aswell..

Another thing i am a bit saddened about is that for example yesterday we went to a small event with our friends and later in the evening we planned on going somewhere so for approx 2h we had time to waste and we could either go home or do stuff. Instead of maybe asking me to spend those two hours together just wasting time and doing couple stuff he straight up texted his other friends if they had time for two hours as if i wasnt there and wouldnt have loved to do something with him and it just kinda feels shit not gonna lie.

TL/DR: My adult friends and i have had our issues but due to how they tend to treat me in these arguments and sometimes in just general discussions, im justinot sure if i should keep associating with them as much as i do

I know this thread is more for dating type relationships. But we obviously have a sort of relationship with our friends and family and im needing help with how to deal with some of my friends. 1 is someone i look at as a brother, weve known each other since we were like 6 and have always been close. Another is a friend i made through him and have known for a few years now, but we arent nearly as close. I will say that i am not a perfect person and i know at times i do stuff that they have every right to get mad at.

And now im just starting to wonder, should i put more distance between me and them? Not cut them out necessarily, but just stop engaging with them the same way i do now. The problems that cause these arguments between us stem from a relatively stupid activity, but the arguments happen anyway because we keep doing the same things. And its not the activity itself that has me feeling this way, its the way they treat me in the arguments and sometimes in general about other stuff. They think so highly of themselves due to their own experiences but dont seem to give much credit to anything ive done. And in the arguments theyll stand their ground to a bitter end and just resort to insults and avoid all reason i give in defense, when they feel they are right.

It?s a feeling that I?ve thoroughly avoided within the past due to me being scared of commitment (I?ve had a +3 year relationship before and I been single and just having casual sex for almost 3 years). 

We met at college one day, and I thought I?d give it a try. But as we started talking about more personal things, I could relate myself to his past experiences dealing with relationships and sex life, and I really liked his cool personality at first (we both have quite complex personalities). 

Now we?ve been dating each other for about 6 months, we have become pretty affectionate, intimate and respectful towards each other and we are very much happy together. But we had decided since the beginning that we would keep things slow and do our best to just enjoy the moment and the time we spend together. He also told me he was afraid of commitment due to being cheated on a past relationship which had affected him very much last year. 

Even though he says he is completely over his ex and what happened, sometimes it stills seems like it is something that bothers him a lot, cause it happened somewhat recently (we both have also dealt with anxiety and depression in the past). I?ve been very understanding and patient about everything, because he actually matters to me and I really care about him. I even offered him time and space for him if he feels that he is not ready to be with someone else. He told me that he wouldn?t stop dating me because of this.

A few examples of what I mean:

If a woman in a relationship never wants kids and is 100% sure she only wants to marry a man who will get a vasectomy but her boyfriend is very vague about the subject or leans towards never wanting to get one, is it emotionally abusive to let them know that him not getting one would be a deal breaker for her? Would it make any difference if she made her choice based off his current hesitancy VS see how they both age together while making it clear that her stance will never change?

If a man who feels that spending each night sleeping in bed with his partner is very important finds himself dating a person who stays up all night for fun, would it be emotionally abusive of him to let her know this is a dealbreaker for him without then breaking up with her about it? If she expresses that she wants to form healthy sleep habits but then does not follow through, is it wrong of him to bring up the subject from time to time as it still being a dealbreaker in terms of a lifelong partner or no?

So I asked him on several occasions to help me pay rent/ pay for things or some type of agreement as I make less money then him and am now paying for double the food and my electricity bill is higher as he has a online business and he works from home. So he agreed he would give me $40 a week for groceries. I spend probably $80 or more a week on groceries. He barely gives me that money and hasn't given me the money in the last 2 months at all. We also agreed he would buy water as he drinks so much of the water as he is a bigger than me and its too heavy for me to constantly buy cases of water. He doesn't do it. I buy the water most of the time still!! I pay for rent, electricity, food, toiletries, laundry (I have to go to a laungry mat) and I split most dinners or pay for myself when we go out. 

When I asked him why he doesn't want to help me pay for rent etc, he says because this is my place and I want him here and he is saving money for us to move into our new place because my lease ends in 2 months and we want to get a place together. He says that he's going to pay the rent at the new place and he wants to get a house that costs $1500 a month. My rent now is much cheaper and I would prefer to just get a place that has lower rent but he says he's going to pay the new rent and that's the quality of a place that he wants to get. I'll just pay for the electric and groceries etc at the new place. I have to let my landlord know a month ahead of time if I'm resigning my lease and we are now two weeks away from that. We have only looked at one place that both of us did not like. Other than that be has made no effort to find a place. He says I haven't rented a house before so I don't know how much time we need. He says a month is more than enough time for us to find, apply, get approved, and pack/ move into to a new place. He said because he has to pay first month's rent and the deposit that he needs a lot of money up front (about $3000) and that is why he doesn't want to pay me anything right now because he will need money for that.

 So he's been living rent-free with me so technically shouldn't he have $1800 extra dollars saved per month that he could have been saving since he's not paying the rent for his old place? I asked him today how much has he saved for our new place and he says he only has $1,800. Which if you want to get a $1,500 place we're going to need about $3000 up front for first months rent, the deposit, and application fee just to get to the new place. I just don't understand how he has not have more saved and is he just using me? I don't make that much money and it just feels like I pay for everything and he is using me or he is either bad with money or obviously doesn't see us getting our place as a priority. I just want to make sure that I'm not being stupid and that I'm not being taken advantage of.",Mooching,1.0

two nights ago he texted me out of nowhere saying he misses me and that he couldn?t get me out of his mind. he said he feels real around me. i was so happy he said that bc i felt the same. we eventually talked on the phone for a little bit and flirted. i texted him first the next day and we kinda had a convo but he didn?t end up responding and now it?s the day after. no text from him.

I'm going to keep the major details in point form:    
- me (31/f) met him (39) about a year ago and started a fwb situation    
- neither of us were looking for anything serious at the time and he had other fwb    
- several months in, says he thinks he's starting to get feelings for the other fwb    
- I have feelings for him, he's known this now for several months    
-says he's shutting everything down sexually and stops sleeping with both of us    
- 8 months later, he and I haven't started sleeping together again and it's been hurting - especially since he's stopped/started sleeping with the other fwb multiple times    
- his communication hasn't been great, which has lead to a lot of hurt (went from saying we'd talk about sleeping together again initially, to giving every excuse as to why we weren't, to recently saying this whole time it's been because he was ""figuring out feelings"" for her)    

A couple of days ago, he and I got into an argument. We were supposed to hang out that evening (which he and I haven't been 
doing a lot in the last couple of months) and he calls me to tell me the other fwb is spending the night and will be there towards the end of our visit. I get upset because I haven't spent the night with him in several months and it hurt how nonchalant he was about her spending the night. He calls back after work to ask if I'm still coming over and I decline, telling him I'm upset about her spending the night when I haven't in so long. He then drops the bombshell that they're in a relationship now, when he's known I want that with him. I'm devastated and basically end up begging him for a chance to be together  which, of course, gets shot down.

He still wants to remain friends, but not only after all this time do I need him to start giving back the things he's taken away ( sex, etc), I'm also having a really hard time letting go of the animosity I feel towards him because of how badly he's hurt me.

He's said he's still figuring things out with her and that they might not work out, but I don't see anything good or healthy coming from sitting here hoping they'll break up, which is what's happening. Even if they do, it doesn't mean I'm going to get what I want with him (a relationship).

225,,12,c76ov6,2,"(sorry for grammar i?m stoned)
We met when we were 14, started dating at 18, went to prom together, traveled, and moved to a big city together. Our families are very intertwined, as I really care about her family and she cares about mine. We briefly broke up when we were 20 for two months, when I went on a long bender of getting many things ?out of my system.? We got back together, and shortly after moved to LA together. We?ve been living together since then, approx 3 years or so. 

When we moved here, we fell into a lovely group of friends and often partied and explored the city.  After about a year, we fell into a pretty mundane routine. I am a very social person, while she is much more of a homebody. First, we decided to take a break from going out as much for financial reasons, which turned into a year and a half of me having to decline invitations to many events, birthday parties, concerts etc. 
Each time I had to cancel these plans, I realized soon enough the invitations would run dry, since we hadn?t been around in so long. I started to get frustrated about this happening so often, mostly because she was tired from work (retail). I decided it would be best to just pick my battles and let it go. This was obviously the wrong decision because it created a new normal. 
I have always been the one to make plans, and was usually the point of contact for our friend group. I heard from friends that they were bummed we weren?t around, and that she wasn?t responsive any time someone hit her up. 
At this point, I have lost contact with a decent amount of friends, and it has also effected my career (freelancer, much needed networking) along with her getting extra needy anytime it seems my career is taking off. 
About a year ago I started to make an effort to rekindle these relationships and get back out there, while explaining to my gf how important this all was to me, personal space, free time, room to pursue gigs and projects. I started to get back in the rhythm, got a new job with great friends and started going out again. 
Her grip on me was still pretty strong, but she let go slightly and let me do my thing. Sometime passes and we fall back into the same mundane routine, and I?m starting to get frustrated again. We had a big blowout pretty much because I wanted more space and she couldn?t give it to me. I regretfully cheated on her after blacking out, drinking with coworkers. I immediately told her the next day, and thought that would be the end of us. Instead she gave me a list of things she wanted me to work on/ do to prove to her that I was committed. 
For the next few months, I did everything and beyond what she requested of me. Things started to get back to normal, which to me was an issue, because ?normal? is what caused me to cheat out of resentment.
After those few months we were back at normal, but definitely bickering more than we ever have before, and getting agitated with each other almost nightly.  I finally feel like enough time has passed, so I bring up again how important it is for me to be able to socialize, and do my own thing from time to time. Unfortunately this ended up starting a huge fight, and she finally says what I?ve been worried about this whole time... ? I?m scared if I give you the space you want, then you?ll leave me? at this point I calm down and assure her that I?m still here, and that I?m asking for this because I still want to be with her. We resolve the fight, and I?m under the impression that she will make an effort to give me the space I need from time to time. 
Barely any time goes by and she pretty much shows little to no effort. She gets bummed when I tell her I need to practice music, or if I?m going to a friends house without her. At this point we?re going out again, partying together etc, which is definitely an improvement, but not necessarily where I need it. 
She recently went on a trip and I stayed home, had a little staycation with my best friends and had the best weekend I?ve had since I was in high school. 
When she got back, out energies were just off. Quick to defend and explain herself, when I didn?t realize there was an issue. Almost like walking on eggshells with everything I say, having to watch my tone etc. 

I really love her. I?m just worried she?s holding me back, and there?s such a strong tension of emotions that I?m not sure we can fix. 

Here I am a week after that great weekend by myself seriously considering leaving this relationship. 
My few issues with it are:
1. We live together, neither of us can afford the rent on our own. 
2. I have money saved up, she doesn?t. 
3. 85% of the furniture in the house is mine, and I would be leaving her without a bed and other necessary items. 
4. I know that her trust issues are because I cheated on her. I thought we worked it out, but clearly we haven?t 
5. I still love her, just maybe not romantically, but would still be very upset to have her completely out of my life. 

Other notables of why the relationship is rocky
1. Sex life has gone down to 1x a month, if that, for over a year. 
2. I feel like she is fully dependent of me, but I am not dependent of her. I cook, clean, plan, and care for her more than I feel she cares for me. 
3. Her jealousy has gotten in the way of my career in the way that anytime I gain traction, she gets more needy, bitter and aggressive, so I get discouraged to grow more. 
4. It feels like we?re growing in two separate directions and I?m not sure if she sees it.

226,,1,c72978,3,"Yesterday I asked for advice on me asking my girlfriend to move in. I?ve attached the previous post below. My girlfriend does want to move in with me, but she is also saying she wants to live by herself first. She?s in school and would have another 2 years to graduate. (Were both 22) Then another year on a lease. So roughly 3+ years until we can live together. I?ve been thinking about it and it?s not necessarily about her moving in. It?s that if she really wants to wait and live by herself first, it?s asking both of us to put a handicap on our relationship and almost seems debilitating. I?d be different if we wanted to wait another 6 months or something but it?s not, it?s another 2 or 3 years. I?m more concerned what?ll happen to our relationship over those 3 years. I?m not trying to convince her to move in, I?m more or less worried about the relationship for us.

229,,3,c7420y,2,"Hey all.  I?ve been on this sub for a while and been impressed with the advice that a lot of you have to share.  So maybe I can borrow your beautiful minds. 

My dad is a widower. Mom passed away suddenly, in her sleep almost 8 years ago, she was only in her mid fifties. They didn?t have the happiest of marriages but it was a long one and they had the kind of unique partnership that only the people in the relationship even understand. 

Dad?s been struggling  for a while after moms death, then got cancer. He beat the cancer but hasn?t really been himself. I didn?t realize how bad things had gotten.  He?s always kept himself to himself, but he?s become a hermit essentially. 

My sister got engaged last year and immediately decided that a lengthy cruise wedding for 2020 was what they wanted. She asked if we?d be ok with it (dad and I) and we both said sure. I mean what were we gonna say? No? It?s her wedding. I didn?t  really want to but I was willing to suck it up and plunk down a small fortune to do this thing with her. Our extended family was also coming so to keep myself from having a panic attack every time I looked at the bill, i just reminded myself it would be a once in a life time family vacation. Cool. Let?s do it.  I booked a cabin and started looking at bridesmaids dresses.  I presumed dad was also looking at it in the same light. Nope. 

We met up for a family excursion last weekend and on the way home, dad started asking if I had booked the cruise and I said I had. He hasn?t yet because he?s trying to find a way to tell my sister that he doesn?t want to do the whole cruise. Basically just get on board, see her get married and hop of at the very next port. He kept going on and on about being lonely. And always being the ?extra? and that being on a long cruise would be too much for him. I was floored. I didn?t know what to say. And honestly, a little scared and guilty. My dads not coping very well right now, and I was blind to it. 

I know that when my sister learns this info she will very likely be disappointed. However, she has had the mindset the entire time that if people can?t make it, they can?t make it. Oh well. You missed their wedding. The grooms father isn?t even going because he?s in ill health. And remember those family members I told you about earlier? They?ve just called with their regrets. So, she will very likely be ok with dads idea of simply paying aforementioned small fortune (plus the single supplemental plus airfare from the back of beyond) to attend her wedding as long as he?s there. Never mind about the distress and loneliness he?ll endure the whole time. And the guilt of leaving only a quarter of the way through the cruise. 



I?d like to suggest to her to modify her plans slightly to have a port-side wedding (boat leaves from a local port very close to us) so dad can attend. It would also mean that the grooms father can attend and our extended family can come too. Plus the oodles of friends she invited who can?t come because of time/money/childcare constraints. The wedding could be on the boat and the rest of us could disembark and leave them to their cruise honeymoon (yes, I would cancel my reservation if she did this). 

Would I be out of line to suggest this to her? Do I just stay out this and let things happen? I?m torn. Your help is greatly appreciated.

230,,0,c748wb,1,"My girls & I are on vacation. One girl (Hannah) was in a 3-year relationship when she found out her bf cheated on her. She met John online in June 2016. Hannah?s bi and had mostly dated girls previously. John was her first serious bf. Hannah was cheated on in a prior relationship, so H wanted an open relationship. But, John insisted on them being exclusive.

Background:

Recently, Hannah found out J had been cheating on her the entire relationship from Francis-the other women on how they dated since 2016, met each other families, traveled together, and exchanged gifts. Francis has some conflicts with her story, one moment Francis said they?re serious and how Francis didn?t know about Hannah & John were in a relationship, and how Francis thought Hannah was John?s side chick since John & Francis started dating before John & Hannah met (which were lies). Then, Francis would claim Francis and John only had a friend with benefits relationship & he had a small dick so she would never date him seriously. Francis tried to make Hannah felt like John was with Hannah because Hannah was a virgin and calm, but both weren?t true. Hannah is one of the sweetest girls I?ve ever known, but I know John & Hannah fought and broke up all the time.

Hannah got the whole story from John with proof in his old devices. Hannah found out Francis twisted the story to make Hannah seemed like the bad guy. Francis knew John had a girlfriend but tried to get involved and tried to get John broke up with Hannah. Francis & John met in April 2016 but they didn?t date until September 2016. Hannah & John started dating in June 2016. They were in the military so they would meet up when John had training. Hannah also found out John got involved with Francis?s sister (Pamela) around the fall 2017. Hannah said John would go on guy trip/ vacation/ work trip, but the truth was he was visiting Pamela. They would snap chated each other all the time. He almost hooked up with Francis?s roommate too. He said there?s nothing he could do when women jump on him. John had a hobby of recording his ?activities? so there?re recordings, and photos of naked Francis on a device which got leaked when he let his friends borrowed the device.

Current situation:

Francis tried to meet up with Hannah multiple times. I don?t want Hannah to meet up with Francis since from what I read of their messages and I heard John said Francis was crazy, had a loose screw in the head, and might hurt Hannah if they meet. John said that he would have cut off contact with Francis but she threatened to hurt him and Hannah because she was involved with a big Latino gang community. Also, from the recordings of a conversation between John and Francis, we knew Francis hated Hannah. She called Hannah names and said how petty Hannah was when John & Hannah had a fight. I think Hannah should not communicate with Francis & ignore her.

So half the girls in the group want Hannah to tell Francis what?s going on between John & Pamela and about the leaked private photos & videos since we would want to know if it happens to us. They think Francis let Hannah know about John?s cheating even if Francis lied about the details to make Hannah felt like she?s a side chick. They think IATA for advising Hannah to not say anything and ignore Francis, since I don?t want Hannah to be involved in anything bad and this seems like bad news. I think Francis won?t believe it & will lash out at Hannah.

The other half think Hannah should confront Francis about her lying & how Francis was such a cheap hoe. They want to do society a favor by teaching Francis a lesson. I think Hannah will just waste her time on Francis. Francis knew exactly what she?s doing. Nothing we could say to her can change the way she really is, a person who lacks morale. The funny thing is that is her last name.

I posted it on a different threat but it was removed because they said relationship advice is better for this. Also, I am in a hurry since we are on a trip so excuse any typo and grammar since I am typing this all on the phone. I know I might be biased because Hannah is my best friend but I think since Francis lied to Hannah, Hannah shouldn?t involve herself with Francis at all.

231,,13,c76ely,1,"So for starters, my boyfriend and I have been together for 6 months now, and everything is going great.
We don't have any problems so far, we enjoy each other's company and are both giving it our all.

I don't currently live with him, so days when we're not busy we go out for coffee and/ or hang out at his place for the day. 
I always feel relaxed, comfy, & safe with him. We always give each other attention when I come over and it took him a long time to get comfortable to do things he would normally do if I wasn't there.

The major thing- Gaming.

Now this by itself ISN'T a problem at all to me, I love video games and it's something I do pretty often at home. 

So let me explain why this secretly bothers me-

I grew up in a very abusive, neglecting home. My mom was a *clean a bit, cook a tad, and leave me the hell alone* type of person. She always seemed to be in a bad mood.

My dad was a 9 to 5 classic husband who went to work, came home, ate, and sat down at his computer to game the rest of the night, usually without a word to anyone. The older my sibling and I got, the more we avoided him. Having him as a father was a nightmare. 
Abusive, manipulative, and overall a bag of shit.

I was a very messed up kid, I had severe anxiety and eventually developed BPD from living through it all. Our issues were all minimized by our parents, (aka they didn't give a shit about our problems because they ""had their own."").
Anyway, you get the point, *great* childhood.

When my boyfriend plays games, it's similar to how my dad did, making remarks at people, the rapid clicking of a keyboard, and completely blocking everything else out.

I'm usually laying in his bed, facing him, and as I watch him all I feel are those old feelings of neglect, like I'm in the same place I was 10 years ago.. It absolutely disgusts me and frankly I'd pay some good money for those feelings to be wiped completely.

He doesn't neglect me, in reality he's one of the most affectionate guys I've met. Reminds me that he loves me everyday. 

I want these feelings to go away, I want to have a relationship and accept everything about the other person.

But I don't want to eventually *live* with someone like this- who will remind me everyday of my father.

Granted it's always possible it won't work out. No matter how perfect it seems now, there's still a chance we could be broken up within a year. Though from the looks of things now, it seems very unlikely.

Any advice helps, thanks.

232,,149,c6xzmb,122," 

I'm 33, she's 34. This is the first relationship I've had in 10 years after the last girl I dated killed herself and it just scarred me for a decade basically.

Anyways, this girl has an amazing personality and we get along so well it's insane. Her personality matches mine and I've never met anyone like her.

That being said, there have been some rocky times. I met her while she was a co-worker at a company I worked for about a year and a half ago and we became best friends essentially and hung up with each other every single day at lunch and then every day after work for an hour or two playing board games.

One thing to note, she had a boyfriend of 4 years at the time that lived with her. We continued with that friendship for 6-7 months and then she told me she was taking a month break from her boyfriend. The day he left, literally the day he left and went away to another state for a month so they could take a break from their relationship, we sleep with each other. It was great, and that month was great in general as we even took two small vacations to the beach and to the mountains.

Well, a month later her boyfriend came back. She asked for a month break from me, then, at that time. A month later, we met up for drinks again and she cheated on her boyfriend with me that night. Apparently after he had gotten back, they hadn't slept together the entire time 

They tried to make things work out, and we had to take another break, but it reached the point where they bought a second bed for his room in the apartment and they became essentially just roommates at that time. Then she and I started seeing each other. He couldn?t move out immediately as he didn?t have a job?she was supporting him 100%.

A few months later, he officially moved out and all of his stuff was definitely moved out of her apartment.

She?s always been attracted to girls as well as guys and she?s a really big flirt. I don?t mind this, but it?s not pleasant. We had been seeing each other exclusively for about 4 months (even though we didn?t say we were exclusive, we were and didn?t see or date anyone else). Well, she went out and ended up taking a girl home with her and slept with her and it really upset and hurt me.  She told me at that time that she thinks she might be polyamorous or want to try it, or whatever that means. That never really was brought up much though except for the month or so while this was going on and we were talking but she hasn?t mentioned it recently.

We got over that issue and she slept with another girl eventually and I was upset for a day or two but got over it.  She?s since gotten over this behavior, at least recently, although she always tells me she may find someone she wants to date and sleep with and that it?s her life and she can do what she wants.

She refuses to be my girlfriend, essentially. She always re-iterates the fact that she is not my girlfriend and we are ?close, close friends with benefits who have very strong feelings for one another.? 

I honestly know she loves me, a lot, and I love her a lot too. We just click with one another.  The feelings are strong and they are real.

She?s stayed in touch with her ex the entire time we?ve been seeing each other, as just a friend. I know for a fact that she hasn?t cheated on me with him too, as she would have told me, as she wouldn?t consider it cheating as we are not ?boyfriend and girlfriend?.

Her reasoning behind not wanting to be my girlfriend is she ALWAYS says this line: ?No, I?m not your girlfriend and I can do whatever I want to do. I don?t want to feel owned or obligated to you and feel like I have to do certain things.?  Whatever that means.

Any advice at all? If anyone actually took the time to read this all, you have my greatest sincerity. I don?t know who to talk to about this and I?m at the point where the daily anxiety and stress of all of this is killing me.","Girl I've been seeing for a year just refuses to call herself my girlfriend; she still sees her ex boyfriend and they cuddle and sleep next to each other sometimes in her bed when friends are in town, but they don't have sex",0.74

Hi Guys, I (30F) & husband (30M) have 2 Daughters 4yo & newborn. 

Yesterday husband decided he wanted to go to boxing (something he?s never done before) between the hours of 6-7pm, meaning he would leave 5.30pm & be back at 7.30pm. I expressed that I didn?t want him to go as that is right at the time of dinner, baths & bed for both kids and having the newborn so fresh I?m still learning to juggle having two kids. Well he helped with dinner and then left. He apologized when he got home, I?m sad to admit I was shocked he apologized.

The big issue happened today. The baby hasn?t slept much & I am exhausted. Our 4yo has been very sick so it?s been especially hard caring for both, running on almost no sleep & dealing with my PND. But I?m managing the best I can. Husband got up from sleeping (he works night shift) and told me he would take 4yo to the park to play for a bit so me and the baby could try and rest. Great. FYI, the baby slept for 20 minutes. 

3 hours later and I?ve asked him to come home. He?s not responding to texts or answering calls. I get worried. I try for 40 minutes and still nothing. In that time, I remembered briefly that he said his old football team were playing a game today. I check, his boots are gone. 

They finally get home & I?ve already got the baby to sleep. I ask if he played football, he denied. 

Well here?s the thing. Not only did he play football, but he left our 4yo daughter with strangers while he played. He says he did this because he knew how I?d react and it?s hard to talk to me about these things. 

Ex-fucking-scuse me?!!!! I, as calmly as I could asked him to explain why he thought lying to me about playing football & leaving our 4yo daughter with strangers was ok. Why lying to me was ok. Why potentially putting our daughter in a dangerous situation was ok. 
He told me that he was keeping an eye on her. 

After I probed as to how he could play a game of football and watch our daughter keeping eyes on her at all times was possible, he admitted that he couldn?t. 

I?m livid. He doesn?t understand that this could have ended much worse. That he put our daughters safety in jeopardy because he wanted to play football. He believes it?s ok to lie to his wife because telling me the truth would have meant he couldn?t play. He 100% believes he did the right thing & that he?s not selfish, but that I?m overreacting.

236,,0,c76vwt,1,"Hi everyone, I (17M) have had some trust issues for a long time, linked to a pretty crappy childhood and a toxic relationship 3 years ago. Today I'm in a relationship with a girl I love and who loves me too and it's a really precious and fulfilling relationship which helps me get over some depressive and adictive tendencies I have.

The thing is, while I am new to sex, she has been sexually active for around a year (which is not an issue at all) and we have sex pretty frequently and she doesn't seems unhappy with it, so there's no reason for me to doubt anything (she's got ADHD and has a strong taste for sex to try and get some endorphyn, but we made it clear that it wasn't an open relationship and she promised not to have sex outside of the relationship).

&#x200B;

But here comes my problem, since it's really hard for me to give even a bit of trust to anyone, I'm also prone to doubt my choice to give trust to anyone, but it's never rational and I don't know how to explain it, but the one doubting is never me, but always a ""voice"" in the back of my head who forces me to imagine the worst in a lot of situations. Right, now I'm always anxious to be cheated on, even tho ***I*** absolutely trust this girl, the voice in the back of my head always comes back to make me doubt and it's getting pretty unbearable.

He used to snap her literally every day, I didn't really know what it was about or didn't really care but as time went on it sort of made me uncomfortable with how much they talked. I didn't tell her to stop talking to her because she's her own person and if it's just friends it's just friends. I got a little sus as it went on. I did ask to see what her snapchat convo was with him like and she didn't want to show me knowing I'd get upset because of some talk she had saved before she even met me. She showed me later that day because she knew it was bothering me. It was him saying how he wants her to sit on his face and stuff like that. I didn't think friends talk to each other like that and I just asked why was he saying that if they were always friends and she said he liked her, but she shut it down and all that. Still confused why it was saved, but that's probably just me overthinking, right?

we were together for a year, and from my perspective everything was great. there were no outward signs of problems. he was attentive and believed in me and we had fun. though he was stressed out about his work and his car seemingly about to die on him (he also came to visit me twice a week and it takes less than an hour to come to my place and I worry this added more pressure :/ ). he had asked for space so he could focus on work and even though I was sad I abliged. but then 5 days later I wrote him to check in on him like a dummy :/, which is what started this.

surprisingly he wanted to hangout before he went on a trip and he also asked me to get a pizza delivered. my money situation was kinda tight at that moment and instead of dealing with annoying delivery fees I offered to bring the pizza instead. he got mad at me when I told him my situation and said don't bother and that he didnt want to be with me anymore. I was shocked and at first I wanted to work things out but then I got angry about him wanting to do this over pizza and said maybe we should break up.

I was pissed off but after thinking about it for a while I realized that this probably could've been handled better.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a year and living together for 3 months. I apologize if this gets a bit long and confusing, but I can't possibly convey how immature and emotionally unstable she can be in only a few words.

Her childhood was emotionally abusive and her family members are total psychos Because of that, she has some seriously deep emotional issues. She is also extremely insecure about her look. In the beginning of our relationship, we never had any problem at the beginning but. I always take care of her , loved her . never critic her look etc... 

i always put her as a priority over myself.  

Unfortunately, she cheated on me twice , when she was drunk ,I forgave he . However, She is CONSTANTLY making comments alluding to my desire to cheat or insinuating that I may be cheating already. Even she went on my phone and found nothing, yet still doesn't accept it. When shes in bad mood because of her bad temper, She puts all her anger on me and start insulting me, I cannot hangout with my friends , or even comment on a friend post on Facebook, especially my female friends, 

To be further , shes sensitive about anything and get easily offended , so i cant talk about everything with her , no matter how much afford i put in this relationship, she makes me feel like I have done nothing,  however i met her family and everything seemed alright and things got worse for like 2 months with them being involved in our life , i do not get any respect from her and even yelled at , when I'm at work and we talk on the phone , she hangs up on me if she didn't like something she hear, she thinks everyone is against her . i asked her if she loves me and she said yes but she doesn't believe I love her, she thinks its out desperation.  doesn't accept any solution when we try to solve a problem   I'm mentally frustrated. but i love her and i want to help her, but how if there is not respect , or at least any hope

244,,7,c75y9f,2,"My (39f) boyfriend (39m) and I have been together for 6 years, known each other for 30. Both of us are divorced from 10 year relationships/marriages. I have a few school age children (with their dad 50/50) and he and I have a preschooler. 
For the last 2 years I've been out of work and stayed home with the kids (child care was my entire paycheck anyway). The plan is for me to go back this fall with hopefully mothers hours. He works 45+ hours a week. I get child support and give it to him for bills, etc. I've considered jobs but with childcare costs and timing, it hasn't worked out. We have discussed these things. 2 of the kids had absolutely horrid school years and I was pretty consumed with that.? 

Our years have been stressful, chaotic, lots of ups and downs but our relationship has been awesome. We genuinely like spending time together, the sex is phenomenal, we have fun and seemed to have worked well together on this roller coaster ride. 
I believed that we were one of those lucky couples who would last because we had real love and adoration for each other. 
Step parenting in general is super hard and my ex is a douche, but overall it's gone pretty well. 

Last week he went out and came home different. It was like he snapped. He hasn't touched me, hugged me, said I love you, or even really looked at me in week. It truly feels like a flip has been switched and he wants nothing to do with me.? He says he still loves me. 
He said he's super burned out and needs time to sort through his head and see if he can continue doing this. 
He admitted that him not opening up to me about how truly stressed he was, just trying to grind everything out, being a home body and not making time for himself are part of the issue. He's not blaming me for everything.  He is the most giving man and just does so much (too much) without a second thought.  
We have discussed it a little, but he really doesn't want to talk about it and isn't really sure what's even going on.? 
I'm trying so hard to give him space.
My heart is crushed. We have had this family for 6 years! I don't blame him at all for being burned out. Working and parenting is so hard,? especially when you keep things bottled up and don't make time for yourself. 
I want to quit being a parent sometimes and have felt completely void of anything positive but I know this stage of life won't last forever. 

Anyway... has anyone experienced a burn out like this? I need all the advice I can get.? I just want to be here for him but how do I do that when he doesn't want to be anywhere near me?

245,,36,c76p2i,22,"So me and my girlfriend are both in our 20's and have been dating for 3 years. Our sex life is awesome as we regularly have sex 2-3 times a week. She is the first girl that I've ever slept with, meanwhile I am her 5th guy. This has never bothered me but she has asked a few times if it has and if I ever feel the need to sleep with another girl. I respond saying that I have no desire to sleep with another girl and I would never toss away our relationship just to fuck someone different. This started conversation about threesomes though and how I would like to experience another girl if she is there with me. She then asked if I would ever wanna do a 3some with 2 guys as that was something shes never experienced and she said that it looks fun. I told her that if that is something she is turned on by and would like to do, then I would be willing to do it with her. So we laid out some ground rules.

&#x200B;

I would be finding the boy to join while she would look for the girl. We agreed that we would both find attractive people but not overly attractive and then see if the partner approves. I ended up creating a tinder account and ended up finding a dude that didn't seem douchey and far enough away that we would never see him again. I also asked for his dick size as I did not want someone bigger than me fucking my girlfriend. (She also agreed as she said that my cock is the biggest she can handle as even mine hurts sometimes. \[6 inches\]). Anyways I find the guy and she chose a girl who was cute but not sexy if that makes sense. So we scheduled the dude to come by on a weekend and then the girl to come on the following weekend.

&#x200B;

So the weekend arrives and the dude comes over and I meet with him alone to just kinda give him some ground rules. I offered him a shot if he was nervous and we ended up taking one together to calm the nerves and get used to being around each other. I told him that he is allowed to have fun and I want to make this experience as authentic as possible for my girlfriend. I said that they he was able to touch her tits and grab her ass. However he was not allowed to choke or slap her or do anything too rough and also no kissing. I told him that she would be giving him head however not to face fuck her and kinda just let her do her thing. So he respectfully agrees as it seems hes just happy to get laid.

So we go into the other room and my girlfriend is waiting for us in lingerie. She looks super sexy and she gets on her knees for the 2 of us and begins to suck both of our cocks. After a while I laid her down as I began to eat her pussy and finger her while she continued sucking him off. She was super wet and it was making me really hard. I started to fuck her but I didnt want to cum right away so I switched positions and allowed him to fuck her. He put on a condom and fucked her for a good 5 minutes before cumming inside her. It was super hot to watch her face as he was pounding away and I genuinely enjoyed the experience as I felt like me and him worked as a team to satisfy her. He then grabbed his stuff and left, so me and her finished off by making out and passionately having sex in the missionary position before we both came. 

&#x200B;

So the next morning comes around and we begin to talk about how the night went. She asked if I enjoyed it and if I would ever wanna do something like that again. I said that it was fun and different, but definitely not something we should be doing all the time. Maybe in another 10 years or so we could try it again. I said that everything went well and asked her if she enjoyed it and what was her favourite parts etc. She begins to get more serious and says that it was good.. too good. And that she would get very jealous watching me be with a woman and that she would never want to watch a woman give me that kind of pleasure. She said that even though the stranger didnt make her cum, that it felt really good and naughty to have another cock inside of her, and she doesnt want me to like another pussy/girl more than her. So she said that shes calling the FFM threesome off. I was just shocked and told her that I was pissed and that it was unfair to agree to both and now call it off because its ""too fun"". I told her that we went over all of the rules prior and that this was potentially relationship ruining. I felt like this is very selfish of her, but I also feel like I dont want to pressure her into something she does not want to do. Either we dont have the threesome and I'm upset. Or I guilt trip her into it and she gets upset. There is a small chance that she enjoys it, but I'm not totally sure. Any advice would be appreciated.",GF Agreed to FFM and MMF 3some.

246,,36,c75w79,21,"10 years ago I made the biggest mistake of my life and married a guy I met day one of university after a whopping year of dating. It was a nightmare. Our marriage started normal, but I didn't clue in on a lot of signals - a 27 year old man wanting to date a teenager; he never instigated sex and was incredibly cryptic about his whole life. I just thought he was really deep and secretive and not some sort problem waiting to happen. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward three years and we haven't had sex in months and no amount of talking, crying or begging would change anything. He first said it was because I smelled - my genitals, armpits and neck had a ""scent"", I tried new soaps, seeing doctors, changing my diet and personal habits but nothing worked. A doctor bluntly said that he thought my husband was deflecting from something else. I go back to my husband who then says he's impotent, so that sets off more than a year of doctor visits - cardiologists, immunologists, urologists and neurologists. He had ultrasounds, PET scans, blood tests and everything you could imagine. Nothing. We tried therapy but that didn't help. I eventually dropped it and by Year 5 of the marriage I was at my breaking point. We hadn't talked about our ""issue"" in months, hadn't had sex in almost three years. We try therapy again and he says he's asexual and known since he was a teen. Then he drops the bomb: He's not going to meet me half way on this, so stop asking for sex. He doesn't want to change our arrangement and he won't do anything sexual, so to leave him alone. He begged me to try it and being young, I figured sure, why not spend the rest of my life celibate. 

&#x200B;

I admit my next move was bad. I started withdrawing from him and through friends met ""steve"" a guy I had nothing in common with or any real reason to see him. I had no feelings for him but loved the sex. We were having sex 1-2 times a week at first and by the time my ex-husband discovered my infidelity, we were very obviously having sex 3-4 times a week. Even if I didn't want to, I did. We made it more and more obvious, I didn't care, I wanted to hurt my ex. Once he discovered my indiscretions, he sought a divorce. It wasn't as easy as you'd think and the wrangling took a while but we finally went our separate ways. I had made a huge mistakes in not telling friends and family how sad I was, I put on a smile for them. When they found out, my ex went to great lengths to tell everyone I had been having an affair. 

&#x200B;

It caused a lot of problems in my personal life. I had to talk to friends, family and even some colleagues about the reality of our marriage and build relationships again. At 26 I was sure I was never going down the aisle again and then recently I met ""Tom"" who has made me question that position. He's everything I want - ambitious, smart, educated, hardworking, funny, charming and so easy going. He can enjoy sitting and watching a film or a nice dinner - we always find fun somewhere. We were just dating at first but have become very serious - we've said the ""I love yous"" and even talked about possibly finding a place to live together. The problem is, friends and family know about my past marriage and the gory details, but Tom doesn't - Tom knows I was married and that I got divorced but nothing more than that. 

&#x200B;

Tom has said how much he looks down on affairs/infidelity and I really fully agree with that so I don't want to tell him that I got divorced because I was banging this guy to get back at my ex-husband. But, knowing how things slip, I don't want him to find out accidentally. I'm really not sure what to do here. 

&#x200B;

When I ask him to try new stuff in bed (videotaping, spanking, new positions), he doesn?t seem to care and doesn?t really get excited.

He grew up valuing family over everything so he?s a huge homebody, I get it.

Now that we?ve almost broken up, now in 4 years he?s done a 180 on the whole traveling and going out thing. It sucks but I just no longer care to go out and plan things. He seems genuine, but I just feel like it?s too late. This is not like me at all 

With the lack of fulfilling and lack of sex in general along with my general disinterest in going out with him, I feel bad. I value sex and adventure/enthusiasm in a partner and I don?t know how I can get over his years of disinterest. 

I don?t know if I should break up with him though. He?s the only person in my life(including my own family) to show me true unconditional love and support. Leaving him would rip out my heart. I don?t think anyone could love me like he does

250,,0,c75w3u,1," yadda yadda yadda, I?m on mobile. apologies in advance. 

my mom has struggled with mental illness my whole life?depression, PTSD, alcoholism?the whole nine yards. it?s had a drastic effect on my life, and once I hit 18 I recognized I had clinical depression like my mom. unlike her, however, I actively sought out therapy to solve my problems; I had just gotten into my relationship with my long-time girlfriend, and I knew I couldn?t be like this & be in a relationship (I was deeply suicidal & needed to be on medication). 

fast forward 4 years. i?m not perfect by any means, but I?m working as hard as I can and I continue to go to therapy; I take medication and I?m actively working to improve myself. my mother? not so much. she?s had traumatic shit happen to her last year, not to mention she keeps trying to get into contact with a mother she?s never had a good relationship with. if I had to sit down and go over every problem my mother had, I?d be here for hours. she doesn?t trust therapists, and confronting her about her problems is like setting off a bonfire. nobody in my family will confront her about her issues. 

my biggest issue with her has been her alcoholism. she isn?t physically addicted to alcohol, but when she drinks she HAS to get drunk. she screams in public, makes a fool of herself, gets mad at us for wanting to leave; one time I had to drive her to my home and hour and a half away?I had NEVER driven on the highway and still had my learner?s permit. why? because she showed up drunk to my dorms. i?ve had to sit down with my therapist to work through it, and to some extent it?s gotten better on my part. on her part? she?s trying to lose weight, so she doesn?t drink as much. 

still, she gets into this state I can only describe as pre-drunk; she?ll make no sense and be somewhat delusional as well as extremely emotional. i never see a cause for this, though i?m starting to think my mom drinks secretly (i?ve seen her do it once). 

i don?t live with my mother and i?m trying to maintain distance. we have a much better relationship than 3 years ago, but how can I deal with these moments? i can?t stand how emotional she becomes; at this point, even if she has a valid reason to be upset, my reflex has been to shut off all emotions so she?ll leave me alone. i don?t want to be NC, but i don?t know if that?s better for me or not.","my [22nb] mother [55f] struggles with mental illness. while I do too, I don?t know how to deal with her at this point in my life.",1.0

256,,11,c75edc,2,"Hi, thanks in advance for any feedback.

I?ve (28F) been with my husband (29M) for 8 years, married for 1. Overall, we?ve had a very strong relationship, support each other, make each other laugh, and are each other?s best friend.

My husband has depression, I would consider it severe; when it first hit him a few years back, he almost lost his job and it took a lot of effort from my end to get him to consider medication (very much needed in his case). His depression is still a day to day concern.

This has truly affected his employment/existential direction in life. I have always had stable employment (I make about 50k now) but he has been unemployed for 11 months now, and doesn?t seem to know where he wants to go professionally. He goes back and forth between periods of looking for jobs, and showing no motivation whatsoever. This has really moved toward him staying home and playing video games all day. I tell him even getting a small job like serving at a restaurant (he?s done this before) will suffice for our income needs right now, but he?s refusing to do that type of work.

I believe this is because of his mental health, but in my mind, he can?t continue to lean on that excuse. I?ve let him do this for too long, and it?s harming himself and our marriage. He also used to go to a therapist, but stopped going about five months back and hasn?t pursued another.

I have always tried to be the best partner/wife that I can be, and am sensitive to his mental health as well (I?m a licensed social worker by trade). I have sat him down multiple times over the past two months and voiced some expectations that I have:

1) He needs to tell me a date that he will be working, and proceed to get employment by that time (whether it?s waiting tables or something in his field- just get out of the house!)
2) He needs to make an appointment with a therapist (and go).


Now, if you are still with me... three days ago, I woke him up around noon (I worked from home) and mentioned the therapist goal. He said that he had an appointment scheduled the day previously, but slept through his alarm, and had not rescheduled.

I was fuming. It?s safe to say I lost it. I do not like to yell, but I figured he hasn?t been responding to anything else, so I may as well try that. I screamed at him that I am putting more effort into this than I probably should be, and if he is going to treat our marriage like a joke, than I will to.

I left, and haven?t been back. He hasn?t said a word to me via phone or in person... which hurts, because although he?s a moron, I still love him.

I?m wondering if he?s trying to give me space, because I?m the one that stormed out? Or if he?s just having a pity party? Or if I should just fucking ask him myself? I know this sounds stupid, but nothing. has. worked. I?m running out of strategies here.

&#x200B;

Okay, so I want to cut my mother out of my life (possibly my father as well) but I just really wanted to know if anyone has any advice or opinions they'd like to share with me. This post will mainly be regarding my mother. 

&#x200B;

Ever since I was little my mother has treated me very poorly. I have only a small handful of positive memories of her (maybe 4 or 5 if I'm being generous). The rest are negative. She was always yelling and shouting. Things weren't good before my parents divorced, but they were arguably tolerable. My parents divorce was messy and involved a bitter custody battle over my siblings and I. My mother became an alcoholic and would often neglect us, especially my twin brother who was born with multiple special needs and can do nothing for himself nor can he communicate any of his needs. It's very hard for me to find the right words and possible examples to correctly paint the picture of how horrendous living with my mother was during and after the divorce. What would upset me the most was that she wouldn't listen to reason. I tried on multiple accounts to explain to my mother how I didn't like her using me as a pawn to get back at my father nor did I like being the 'messenger pigeon' between the two (because they could never speak with each other without screaming and yelling).  This would only get me yelled at. She would then bring up anything and everything to paint herself as the victim in the whole situation and that this was all his fault so I should be mad at my father and on and on and on. She would take every chance to drag my father's name through the mud and try and turn us all against him. 

&#x200B;

I 100% believe that my mother only wanted me and allowed me to live in the house with her so she could continue to paint herself as the victim. That, and if she kicked me out of the house my father would hear about it and take her back to court to try and make her lose primary custody of all of us. I also 100% believe I was nothing more than a pawn to her. Time and time again she would choose her anger and resentment towards my father as being more important than the mental and emotional well-being of me, and after so many years of this I'm just tired. I'll have personal and interpersonal damage for the rest of my life for the hell she put me through. Nowadays I live my grandparents and I only see my mother for a few hours every few months or more. I refuse to take her calls and listen to her voice messages because I fully expect them to be filled with drunken angry rants.

&#x200B;

I was planning on waiting until I was financially independent before having a sit down conversation with her about how she failed as a parent and how much that hurt me but recent events have prompted me to do it earlier and most likely over text and phone. Nothing dramatic has happened in her life to make me think she has changed so I fully expect this all to be one giant trainwreck, with my mother becoming enraged and trying to call and shout and yell at everyone, especially my father.

&#x200B;

So just to reiterate I would appreciate any advice other people would have about how to cut her out of my life, how to stop this small part of me that feels guilty about doing this, and any particular structure I should give to my explanation to her. I am open to hearing other peoples opinions about cutting my mother out of my life, but there is most likely nothing anyone can argue or tell me that will prevent it from happening. The only one with that power would be my mother but even then I'm not sure. She will always be my mother. That will never change. However, in my eyes, she is no longer my mom and hasn't been for a long time. Sometimes I doubt if she ever was one at all.

269,,8,c74cw8,1,"Little info: We started talking 6 months ago and we met on Reddit casually.
He lives in the USA and I am from Italy.

We have been chatting nearly every day and we were kinda close...he started liking me first, then he dated a girl irl for 2 months then broke it off then I caught up feelings too.

Lately we had a misunderstanding over the relationship we had and right now I am not sure if I should stick to being friends even if I want to have him in my life.

We flirted and sext too, distance was an issue so we could not date realistically...it's just that when we were sexting he mentioned being FWB and it hurt because he did not know I was not into that kind of stuff.
He thought he did not really think of it since we could not date anyway, apologize etc but his intentions were just to visit near here but not actually date and stick to being friends.

He said he always cared about me as a friend, he cares about me a lot, he did not want to lose me as a friend but I had a bad reaction because I basically deluded myself and I hate the idea of being into casual stuff.

Idk if I overreacted because sometimes I think it would not be a big deal to just be friends, I actually do not want to lose him too as a friend.
He insisted to stay friends, stick to being platonic and not deal with this kind of stuff again so we can stay in each other lives...but initially I refused.

I am super confused because I don't really know if I want to actually be part of his life and viceversa JUST because I care or if I just hope he would change his mind sooner or later. Maybe a tiny bit of both?

I had to deal with some rejection lately (before all of this) so I decided to focus on myself and I have plans etc
This hurts to lose him but the idea that he does not like me enough even if we live in two different continents, we are both young with life plans etc
I heard some people do LDR but they are hard and generally fail but I keep thinking that he just does not care enough.

He always asked me about my life, messaged me everyday, he said he always cared about me in general and wanted to keep being friends.
He said he did not mean to hurt me, he felt pretty bad over it and said if cutting him off made sure he was not going to hurt me anymore then he supported me.

He is also a bit strange because several days ago he sent me a message on Snapchat where he said I was a good girl, I was doing great and a snap where he said I love you but then later on he explained he does not know why he did it, he was in a weird mood, it was random and he was these ourburst and he does it to his friends irl too.

He just messaged me impulsively but he was proud of me for graduating HS because it was rather hard for me (due to depression, anxiety etc).

He has a complicated love life too...maybe he jist likes my company and attention but does not want to commit and go any further, he said he would have dated me if we lived closer.

I have an important exam soon and I have to study but this thing has been driving me crazy.

TLDR; Me and online guy have fallen apart due misunderstand over the nature of relationship. We like each other but cannot date due to distance, idk if we should go back to being friends.

In the morning we woke up happy and playful, and I ended up taking his phone and starting to scroll through his texts jokingly, neither of us thinking anything of it. His phone was on his Instagram and as I scrolled through the direct messages, I saw a recent one that mentioned my name. I curiously opened it and what I found made my blood boil so much that I got a nosebleed, called him a pig and after some tears, confusion and loud voices, stormed out.

The first thing I saw was flirty messages from a big get-together his family was hosting, that I wasn?t able to come to. His aunt is recently divorced and since has a new boyfriend, who she loves very much. The girl my boyfriend was messaging was his daughter. The messages were along the lines of, ?bring your sexy ass over here? etc, which my boyfriend swears is like a jokey game they do or something. Then I scrolled further and saw messages saying things about me from when we had just started dating such as, ?this girl?s got some balls on her, and is fiery etc etc.? 

I was absolutely livid. I don?t remember saying the exact things I said to him whatsoever but I know they weren?t nice, at all. A cheating pig was among them. He tried desperately to explain himself, that it?s someone he just talks to for fun like that from time to time, and all that. I think it?s weird. You don?t text a cousin like that, and this isn?t even a cousin.

272,,10,c75pw7,1,"Hi r/relationship_advice,

My family has been posting their home to AirBnB on busy weekends (we live in a medium-sized city where concerts/conventions regularly sell out all the available hotels, so they can make a bit of extra cash by renting their home.) Myself (24m) and my wife (24f) live 45 minutes away in a neighboring town.

Problem is, whenever my parents rent their house out, they need a place to stay. They obviously can't book a hotel because they only rent the house out on super busy weekends, and they frequently come to us to ask if they can stay at our place. This wouldn't be a problem if it were a one-off thing but its been happening more and more frequently lately.

I love my family and genuinely enjoy spending time with them, but I hate feeling obligated to host them on a moment's notice whenever this happens. What is a kind way I can say ""no"" to overnight stays without it sounding like they aren't welcome in our home?

&#x200B;

extra info: we have a guest room because wife's family lives out of state and uses it when they visit us. We see them much less than my side of the family. We are in our second year of marriage and are still struggling with setting boundaries because my siblings are still dependent.

also, sometimes they will provide us with a small cut of the AirBnB sale, but its never stated up-front and this isn't always the case so it's not exactly a ""business deal"" when they stay with us.

I?m sure this is normal to some degree but I don?t know how to deal with it.  I honestly don?t know how to cohesively put my feelings together in a way that conveys all of the emotions involved.  

Long story short: My ex fucked up my head bad and I hate to admit it.  She broke up with me the day after Christmas a few years ago while I was suffering a severe depressive episode after ending the relationship with my narcissistic/abusive parents the month prior.  My way of coping was to have sex with whoever was willing.  

Starting less than a week after we broke up I found my first partner.  Over the next 2 years I  slept with over 100 women.  Truthfully I stopped counting because it disgusted me so much but I couldn?t stop.  I was trying to fill some imaginary hole of missing love that could never be filled.  

Eventually I realized what was happening after some quality microdosing.  I slowed it down in 2018 and started to try and gain control. I cut my number down to maybe a dozen or so with the number dwindling towards the end. 

In 2019 I?ve had sex with a total of 3 women.  Each time I?ve felt horrible during and afterwards to the point I don?t want to continue. It distracts me  and I?m unable to fully give myself to the moment.

Today I met someone I was enamored with.  We hit it off instantly and there was a connection.  We ended up spending a few hours together then sleeping together in my car.  I regretted it immediately/during and didn?t know what to do other than continue the task.  We finished, it wasn?t special and she was late where she has to go.  I felt like it was a waste of emotional energy. 

I fear I won?t ever be able to be in a healthy relationship again.  I don?t know what steps to take to heal or even the direction I should be going.

Don't know the details of it but essentially she got him into a pyramid scheme she was a part of and he blamed her for all the money and time he lost in it.

She unfriended him on Facebook, changed her number so he wouldn't be able to reach her, has only shown up to family events (Christmas, birthdays, etc) if requested by other family members and won't speak a word to him.

280,,3,c724id,10,"Hello!  So I am an over thinker and read too much into things but sometimes need an outside voice to get me in line.

Background:  I (M 34) met my current boyfriend (M 34)in early April, he works on a cruise ship and has been gone since end of May and isn?t back till end of September, I went and visited him in Orlando, I?m live in Mexico, last Saturday.  Was an amazing time with him, he even said that it made things even stronger for him.  We are actually making plans for when he is done work in September, going on a trip and if everything continues as it is move in together after our trip.

Anyways, at the beginning he told me that he wished I was a little sappier in my texts, which I was totally fine with because I was holding back not trying to be too much at the beginning.  So everything is great except when he went onto the ship in May he can only text a couple times a day unless he is a US or Mexico port, then he calls/facetime.  But since the amount of texts have dropped so has his I guess emotionally charged messages and little to no response to the ones I send.  Such as I sent one Thursday a picture of the wing of the plane and added text saying ?wish I kissed you a little longer before we parted?.  Nothing.  But continues conversation about other messages sent between us. I don?t really know what to think of it.  Maybe because the messages are sometime buried in with other texts? 

Then to add to it, thanks to WhatsApp, I can see that he went online and didn?t even respond, no good night nothing...  I know there can be a lot of explanations such as he lost his connection before he could respond.  

Need advice do I straight up ask him if I should just stop sending those sappier messages?  Am I just over thinking?  I would like a little explanation from him though, if he likes them and just can?t respond I?ll keep sending but I won?t know without asking...

282,,19,c6yi7w,23,"Some background: My GF and I love each other but I have been apprehensive of her situation for quite some time now. She suffers from chronic migraines and is perpetually in pain ranging from mild pain to crippling / day ending pain. This has affected her school and work life and from my point of view, totally dictates her life. Any failure in her life, (dropping classes, not doing homework, not showing up to work, basically any obligation) is because of her migraines. She does not personally take any responsibility for anything that occurs since I've met her and when I try to point this out, she shuts down and becomes irate and that I ?don?t understand? because I don?t live in ?perpetual pain?. As such, she has dropped 3 semesters in 2 years and has failed to keep a job for the entirety of our relationship.

I used to believe that it was reasonable but through many things, its become clear that she greatly overestimates just how sick she is. She is almost always ?sick?. Says she says she has a fever about once every other week, etc. She is allergic to an insane amount of things (many of which I have personally confirmed are completely factitious) and whenever I tell her, oh well you ate X because it was in Y, she plays it off, ?Oh maybe, I?m not. -- Well, I had a bad reaction before!, etc.? This combined with her inability to take responsibility for anything, made me really doubt how much pain she claims she?s in. This is also something others who don?t know her have commented on. Many of those who knew her thought she was a hypochondriac which is something she takes great offense to.

She also lies to me about various things. Such as her grades, insisting that she is doing 'well' when in reality she isn't passing a single one of her classes, I asked her to not inform my family that she came to visit me when I was out of town (my family is conservative and does not accept any level of bf/gf cohabitation before marriage) -- she told my sister, luckily she does not care (as I do not) but it was a breach of my trust, and a few other less important things.

Her family is a train wreck and honestly something I think contributes to her poor health condition (undue stress = worse migraines). Her dad apparently did some questionable things to the children. Her mother is a piece of work (leaves her to take care of the newborn and the other kids so she can have sex), spends her alimony money to buy random things instead of food for the family, doesn?t work, yells and screams at the children, is constantly gone, complains about everything, her house is unspeakably filthy (roaches, pee stains, the smell). Her parents encourage her to marry me because I have a lucrative job (>250k/yr) which also kinda scares me.

My family, my friends and basically everyone in my life told me that I should probably look elsewhere and that there were too many problems with her moving forward. This has been a huge point of contention for me and something I communicated to her because these people matter to me. I feel something is genuinely wrong if everyone says its a bad idea -- something I also told her because I feel I should be able to be completely transparent with my partner. This becomes relevant later.

All of these things aside, she is incredibly kind to me. Going out of her way to be nice to me (she is from a poor background and she spends a considerable amount of her money on thoughtful gifts for me), is patient, loving and aside from the previous, I am generally very happy with her. That said, these problems are completely life encompassing and something that caused me a lot of distress -- especially the broken trust. As such, I asked her to break up. She panicked and quite literally begged me to stay, saying no one else would love her because of her problems, etc etc. I reconsidered but these problems and how I felt about them never went away. Soon thereafter I told her I wanted to break up again. She reacted in the same way, and because I was breaking up with her for 'reasons out of her control', it made it really difficult for me to not cave when she would call hyperventilating and literally begging me to stay. We would get back together but a week or two later, I would end up in the same position. This happened like 2 more times before I eventually blocked her on my phone with the last break up. She used her siblings phone to text me, emailed me with different emails, etc. I read them all because while I knew I didn't want to be a part of the relationship any longer, I cared about her deeply. I?m not sure when during the 5-6 break ups we?ve had but she would also mention killing herself, that I was the only positive thing in her life (she hates her family), etc. etc. Eventually she settled with her being my friend and would drop hints of wanting to get back together and the like. This went on for a few weeks until she slowly stopped contact.

I was not blameless here. I made mistakes. I told her that I didn?t care for her, and that we were over, etc. etc. to push her away -- namely because she would not stop emotionally tormenting me with how miserable she was without me in her life so I figured I would try anything to help her move on. These things are obviously horrible to say to someone who is still in love with you and I regret saying these things.

Eventually, she gave me two weeks of space. I made a reddit post about the situation, had some long conversations with some friends and decided that I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and try to work through our problems. When I called her, she told me that she was ?over? me and that I was a ?horrible person? and that I ?chose this?. She says that I let my family dictate the course of our relationship and that I never tried to ?change? for her. I apologized, wrote her long winded letter explaining that I was wrong to let family, friends, etc. influence (in part) my decision, that I was sorry for not trying harder and that I would like one more chance. She treated me rudely / uncaringly (basically the opposite of what I did when she was the one asking) -- something that still bugs me if I?m being honest. I know she has every right to do this but nonetheless, it was a kindness I granted her (being there for her emotionally even when we were ?broken up?), I don?t see why this couldn?t be reciprocated or faked at the very least. In the end, she ended up blocking me.

About a year ago, she began hanging out with a newer coworker (38F) who is also single. They go to lunch together every single day and spend time together outside of work regularly. I usually go to lunch with the two of them on Fridays. (I am frugal and health conscious so prefer to bring lunch from home the rest of the week.) The new coworker is nice enough but I keep getting this gut vibe that she does not like me. I can?t put my finger on it because when I am with them as a group everything seems fine. She has never been overtly rude to me or anything like that. But I have tried to reach out and connect more on a personal level with this new coworker and she doesn?t seem interested in making friends with me at all. Over the last six months or so, the two of them have become closer and frequently spend time together. Some distance has developed between me and my friend, but I?ve tried not to let it bother me since I?m happy for her to have a new friend who is also single. Honestly, sometimes I do feel a bit left out and wish they would invite me on their outings. But I know that adult friendships wax and wane, and I certainly don?t want to entertain any petty, jealous, or otherwise negative emotions.  

A couple of months ago, my friend invited a few coworkers (including myself and my husband) to spend the July 4th holiday weekend at her family lake house a couple of hours away. I accepted the invitation since it seemed like a good opportunity to get to know the newer woman better and hopefully form some connection that might lead to me being part of their group. 

Fast forward to a week ago. I find out that my friend, the new coworker, and another (3rd) lady at work made plans to have dinner and see a dance performance after work on Friday (yesterday). I felt sad that they had not asked if I would like to join. We work in a majority male department and we are literally the only four ladies in the office. Again, I tried not to dwell on this too much since it was giving me flashbacks of middle school and getting snubbed by the popular kids. 

But the last straw was yesterday when I stepped out of my office at 11:30 to ask where they wanted to go to lunch to find they were already gone. I never bring lunch on Friday since it is our typical routine to go out together. So I went and got a sandwich by myself. Upon return, I stopped by my friend?s office to say hello and I commented on their early departure. The only response was ?yeah, we left around 11:20?.  Again, this seemed really intentional and unusual. 

So now I am feeling extremely awkward about this upcoming Lake trip in a few days. I no longer want to go at all. I am an introvert so the idea of spending multiple days with a large group of people (several of her extended family will be there too) is already somewhat daunting for me. But this recent weirdness has made me feel unwanted and has sent my anxiety through the roof. I barely slept at all last night and today has been one long anxiety attack. My instinct is to feign sickness and back out of the trip. I really don?t want to lie, but I feel like if I try to have an honest conversation with my friend right now about how I?m feeling, it would put an awkward cloud over the whole trip and I don?t want to do that because she has been planning it for a long time. I don?t want to make things worse. I also don?t want to do anything that will negatively impact my professional situation. I believe myself to be a mature and not overly-sensitive person.

Long story short, we've never had the best relationship and it's been a long time thing where I honestly can't tell if he's being ridiculous and angry at me all the time or if I'm just being bratty or childish. He does work a lot and very hard (multiple jobs) and makes decent money, and supports my family including me, but I feel like he has a chip on his shoulder and the way he treats me can be so rude and disrespectful (just on a human level). He's gotten really angry and cursed at me in public for small things and it's been humiliating (people stopping us, asking him not to speak to his daughter that way, etc). Things happen on a daily basis that make me so angry. Today, the cat peed on her bed and he went to put the bed in the washer and told me to clean up the wet floor under it. When he came back and I was cleaning, he was mumbling and ranting telling me to make sure I used a wet towel first and then dried it. He was cursing and acting very angry towards me (saying things like 'make sure to do a fucking good job unless you want to live in a house will smell like cat piss', etc). I did't understand why he was acting so upset towards me, considering what the cat did was not my fault, but I wasn't surprised (this is often just his attitude). I didn't reply but a few minutes later, went into the kitchen where he was and asked him if he could clean the eggshell from the sink (he cracked a hard-boiled egg and peeled it into the sink earlier in the day). He responded ""Why don't you fucking do it?"" (very angrily) and I said ""it was your egg."" He exploded, saying things about how hard he works and how he 'does everything for everyone in the house' (I feed the cat and when she does things like rip up paper or newspaper clean it up, as well as sweeping and cleaning the cat litter). I was getting a broom from the closet in the kitchen as this happened and replied that I was currently cleaning up after the cat. He said ""with a broom? You're cleaning up cat pee with a broom?"" very sarcastically and angrily and I said yes, as it was to sweep some dirt that was under the cat's bed away (it was hard to clean the floor without it being empty of tiny pieces of dirt). He said something the lines of ""good I'm glad, go do it now"" and went back into the kitchen to eat (he never cleaned up the eggshell). As I was sweeping he came back and said very angrily ""the reason the cat peed in her bed is because you haven't taken proper care of her litter box, I've seen you go into the bathroom, see it's dirty, and do nothing about it.""

It's also worth saying she's a young cat and not fully house trained -- she is going to make bathroom mistakes, not because of anyone's fault) but I didn't reply. He then went on to say that I ask him to do everything and don't do anything myself and more things along those lines, and that he works multiple jobs and then comes home and walks the cat for a few hours every day (she used to live out on a farm in the countryside, hence not being house trained, and loves being outside. Because we live in a city, we usually walk her around our neighborhood on a leash so she can be outside but won't run away). He then went on to say things along the lines of I ""want my dad to make the perfect clean household for me without doing anything myself."" The whole situation made me so frustrated and angry and I started crying once I was in private. It's not just this alone, it's the way he treats me and makes me feel daily (I can't put the combination of anger/resentment/frustration I have into the right words). I don't know what to do -- am I not being understanding to how hard he works? Am I not picking up my 'fair share' in the household? He has said he only works so much so my siblings and I can pay for college later on but the way he makes me feel day to day is so ugly. Any advice on how to deal with it? Do I talk to him about it? Should I just avoid talking to him altogether and wait until I'm old enough to leave home? Maybe any words from those in a similar situation?

288,,0,c77k2f,1,"This is a very long post and I don't expect any responses because of that but here goes nothing.  
I've seen interactions on social media between him and his exes from when he was dating each of them about 4 and 5 years ago and I can't help but feel like he's never been nice to me like that or shown that much interest or enthusiasm with me. Last year we met for the last time before I had to go away for 6 months and we decided to do a bunch of fun stuff like go-karts, laser tag, VR games together. In between activities I couldn't help but notice he was constantly texting someone else who turned out to be an ex, and would barely speak to me. After a long time of trying to deal with it myself, today when I tried talking to him about how I feel uncomfortable because he seems to be close friends with his exes he got mad at me and later asked what was wrong with it if someone was close friends with an ex and how was it anyone else's concern. To be clear, that was in response to me saying that I know it might be unreasonable and probably not something I should be concerned with, it was just upsetting me for some reason. I don't know if I'm being immature or if this is unacceptable behaviour. Later he told me he hasn't spoken to either of the exes I mentioned in over a year.  


Some background details:

Disclaimer: This doesn't even scratch the surface of the dynamics of our relationship or his overall personality so it may sound extremely biased.   
I'm just trying to figure out if I'm being overly neurotic and immature. We met in February 2017 but didn't really get close until May/June of that year. I had to move to a different country in July. We have never officially dated or been in a relationship or anything like that, just casual sex when we see each other once or twice a year when I go back home and no other physical intimacy apart from that. Things have been really complicated for the past two years because we live in different countries and he never clarified his feelings for me whenever I've tried talking to him about it. That conversation has always ended in a big fight and he refuses to talk to me for weeks on end when that does happen. I'm paraphrasing but last time he said he didn't want to be with me even though he thought I was an amazing person but he couldn't give me what I want and I deserved to get what I want. I just wanted to officially be with him. Then he later messaged me saying he wished he could see me.  


All I know is that there isn't anyone else in the picture, he just doesn't seem to want to be with me in a relationship but also wants me around in some capacity. I have made it very clear how I feel about him. He says he isn't looking for anyone to be with right now. I don't know how he feels about me but if I had to guess I'd say there might be some feelings there on his end but the long distance aspect might be making things difficult, but sometimes it also feels like he just doesn't care at all. It just always feels like he has no regard for my feelings whatsoever every time something is a problem between us. It's always me who has to apologize even though I wouldn't realistically say I was the only person entirely wrong about whatever we are fighting about at that point in time. He has told me to ""fuck off"" quite a few times whenever there is a disagreement about something and I can't imagine him behaving like that with anyone else. I feel like I'm being taken for granted and am always blamed for being the bad guy in every situation. Now he just expects me to apologize for everything every time once he unblocks me on all channels of communication after like 6 weeks of no contact. I just can't tell if this is normal behaviour when someone is mad at another person. It doesn't seem like he does any kind of self-reflection to see why I might have said or done something, even if I've already told him why.","Is it normal for me (23F) to feel uncomfortable if someone I've been involved with (29M) romantically but not dating, for the past two years, is close friends with his exes?",1.0
289,,1,c74u2g,1,"Hello [28M], i always read post from other people but dont interact much. I think i have to let it be known im on mobile and english is not my first language.
Ok, so i live in US, i earn a bit more over here than what i used to in my home county in South America.
I decided to move here about 2 years ago, working as a dishwasher until my work permit[asylum] was granted and moved on to a full time reclying gig as an Crane Operator.
My father[60] has suffered from epilepsy for about 10 years after he had an accident that a machine broke his skull. No compensation or full early retirmement was given, we fought but corruption is very strong sometimes. He can still talk, walk, run, swim, drive, not dependent what so ever. Ocassionaly[about 1 every 60 maybe 90 days have an attack] he will just scream while asleep, and start shaking violently, bite his tounge and snore while his eyes are open, usually at a time like this we just put alcohol under his nose, and if we are lucky he regains conciousness at that time, otherwise we will roll him to the side, and let him sleep it out, sometimes he will get anothet seizure or rarely 3 at around 30min intervals. He does sleep in an individual bed and my younger brother [16] sleeps next to him in a sofa to keep an eye out sometimes.  My house is set up in 1 bedroom. I live in the living room and when my brother is not here [sleepovers and such] i just keep my dads door open, normally i can hear his scream when an attack is about to begin. Sometimes ""the seizure: gives him a warning... like he will be talking and just slowly pass out, or he will be mumbling/forgetting words, so he goes to take a pill and sleep off to bed. He does take 5 types of medications.
I know it is wrongly formatted but just want to give out as much background and detail as i can. My dad is a nice guy. He has taken care of me all he can. I had a severe asthma attack one time i was visiting relatives on the U.S. He stood by my side at all times. This was back in 2002. Then he set me up with a medic for it, money was not as much an issue since he is an Technician in Industrial Maintnance. Not rich by a long shot but he could give us a nice living just by his own wages in a family of 5. I was on medication for asthma for about 3 years then outgrew it by the time i got into 9th grade. Another thing i wanna say is he let me make my own mistakes like being drunk and crashing once and not getting mad at me or those awful lectures just being his supportive self, when i think about it it was harsher for me since i knew i was costing him his hard earned money.
Back to the topic at hand. I decided to move here for financial reasons. I just gotten a house and wanted to fix it up nicely. I got a work permit after a looooong time of applying. I dediced to try it, i know english very well and a costumer streaming service immediately hired me after my permit was approved. So money is ok, but after 6 months of being by myself my dad, mom[48] and 2[27,16] siblings came here to live. My dad out of nowhere got worser and couldnt land a job for about 2 months, which is when my mom started working, but was not thrilled she had to give money into our household while one of my stepbrother[31] had been sent to our county after being deported by Canada [which is why i dint risk going to there] So, she moved out into a complex about 10 blocks away from us, i love my mom, we talk, chat, go to dinner sometimes and is not barred from being into our home whatsoever, we had mothers and her birthday celebration here.
As the first born son, it is my job to look out for my dad. I pay the rent, the wifi and some groceries [my dad helped pay for food since he worked at a cleaning service] i told him to not worry since i would pay it all. He did try to find jobs but whenever he does get alot stress even if involuntary he will have a seizure. He kept on getting them every 2 weeks. So all bills where given to me. My sister does not work and has 2 daughters [4and1] my brother is underage and i want him to focus on school.
I have been thinking alot about it, that we can go back to our contry, crime has always been bad but our home is near big bussinesses so it is always near the police and military, money is thight but you know my dads home is paid off, he could get retirement benefits since he hit age and my sister could stay with him to take care of him[her husband ran away and if i stay here i could send her money]. Just this morning he got into a crash, around 45miles into a tree stump. No one was hurt but he did get send into the hospital. He had just driven me to work around 640am i got a call from a nurse around 710am. He has no fractures, slight gash on his arm, and a bonk on his head [which triggered a seizure]. He came back from the MRI just fine.
Im so sorry but dint have anyone to speak to since i been kind of a loner this past 2 years after moving here to U.S.. And the few ""friends"" i have here are just work friends. I am afraid to ask any familily members since my grandfather died in 2004, my dad worked in the U.S. and when he heard he was hospitalized he dropped everything to go see him against my grandpapas advice. My uncles say if he did see him show up and throw away the american dream that might of guilt tripped him into his deathbed, but i know not seeing his dad one last time hurt him badly.
So should i tell my dad and sister to go back to South America and live there whereas i still live over here and ocassionaly send money or go back as well with them to work in the capital as certified crane operator[money is ok].
I spoke to my mom about it, she dosent wanna go back and wants my younger brother to stay here since he has more academic oportunities.
I dont want to seem like an ungrateful son but if he is overthere we can get him back to the specialist who treated him and follow up on his procedures. The money i make is just barely enough to get by but if i were able to get 2 roomates like i did at the beggining i could certainly have them live over there without working.

So here it is.

My GF and I have been together for 13 months now, about 2 months into our relationship, she was hanging out with a female coworker and that coworkers roomate, a male. While they were hanging out, the guy kept making unwanted advances on my GF and she told him numerous times that he needed to stop and that she has a BF, he kept doing stuff, grabbing her thigh, trying to put his arm around her, until he eventually grabbed her, pulled her in and bit her lip extremely hard to the point that it left a mark and drew blood. 

Fast foward to now, they've started talking as loose acquaintances on snapchat, he apologized for how he acted then and wants to pick her up to hang out, she says he seems super nice now and that he seems sorry for what he did, but I'm still 100% against the idea of them in the same room cuz I'm afraid he'll hurt her again, if not do something worse. She seems extremely upset that I don't want her to and she says she wants to hang out ""Cuz he seems nice now and she wants friends"" 

I've expressed heavily how I feel about it to her and she keeps trying to talk me into it, saying things like ""meet him and see how you feel about him then"" but I honestly just wanna knock him out if I'm ever in the same room as him. 

She mentioned to him how I feel about it and he says that it's abusive that I wont let her hang with who she wants. 

Idk what to do.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I met first year of college together in USA and everything was fantastic.  We had no major issues and really brought out the best in each other while still giving good space to grow on our own.  In highschool she always had this fantasy about traveling and exploring and her Jr. year she went abroad and traveled europe for about 7 months while we did distance.  I had anxious feelings about a lot of the things she did over the summer and the way she was acting but we had done distance a number of times as we'd been dating for about two years at this point and there wasn't anything concrete to break up or take action over but something felt off.  I visited her at the end of the summer and things only got weirder.  She was fluctuating between being really distant and being really loving and again something just felt off but I had nothing concrete to act on so I felt stuck.

&#x200B;

Eventually the anxiety got to me and I invaded her privacy for the first time deciding to go through her phone.  She was in the shower and my heart was racing as I skimmed through old texts.  Unfortunately I found exactly what I didn't want to find.  She had confided in a friend about making out with a guy and it being exciting but she knew it would hurt me and was conflicted because we had such a positive relationship.  The end of the texts made things even worse.  A few months later in the conversation the day before I arrived there was a text to the same friend as before that just read ""ugh I did more things I shouldn't have, I'll tell you later.""

&#x200B;

She came back and a massive fight happened where she explained her conflict of not wanting to break up but being curious.  How she wanted to tell me later but didn't find the courage.  And about the mysterious texts at the end.  At first she said nothing happened just that ""something almost did but she backed out.""  The trip ends and I thought we were going to break up.  About a week later she comes forward on a skype call to tell me that she actually made out with the guy at the end as well and that she realized how it was all fucked up and she needed to come forward with everything.  

&#x200B;

Senior year of college starts and we're on and off the whole year but slowly overcome problems/trust issues and end up in a really positive place by the end and decide to continue with things.  It's now been another two years and we've both traveled and done distance and everything has been fine, communication and happiness is great.  But I still have this anxiety from the events.

&#x200B;

I trust when she tells me things but due to the nature of how I found out sometimes I feel like there's something being left off that I need to uncover.  We're both really happy and growing together after almost 6 years but this anxious feeling keeps creeping up.  The most recent time she went on birthright and told me during the trip that she developed feelings for someone but didn't act on it.  She wanted to be perfectly honest and communicate everything to me and how she addressed it to avoid things going further.  This sort of situation is awful for my anxiety but I keep working through them and just see it as an artifact to work through together and that the situation is normal.

&#x200B;

Last weekend though she was on a roadtrip with a friend and this previous crush was the only person she knew in the city where her friend was getting dropped off.   The friend she was roadtripping with parted ways and she slept at the crush's apartment without telling me. Her day was hectic due to a bunch of car troubles and she just told me she was busy when I asked to talk the night she was at his apartment.  She said she was getting ready for bed but then responded to my text 2 hours later just saying goodnight.  The next day she tells me about why the day was hectic and how she ended up there and that she knew I would be anxious and just wanted to deal with it when she had more time.

&#x200B;

I feel like since I never really had closure on the mysterious texts about the guy at the end of the summer that I can't fully rebuild my trust.  Part of me wants to believe that when she came forward after cheating abroad that she was open about everything.  Another part of me thinks that she knew that saying she only made out while coming forward on her own would give her the best chance of me taking her back.  The trust boils up in situations like this where I want to trust her but since I don't really know what happened at the end of that summer where she cheated and if she came forward with everything or not I don't know if it's genuine or all an act.  This makes me super anxious and jumps me to really dark places since I don't have the closure of if it's all honest or not.

&#x200B;

I want to know if this can be overcome.  Since there's no way to concretely know what happened with the guy at the end of the summer where she cheated I won't ever have that concrete type of closure.  

Does this mean I'll always be anxious in these situations and always feel like there's more I'm not hearing since I don't know if she came forward with everything?  Everything else in the relationship is fantastic and I don't want to throw that away when there isn't really anything concrete to go off of.  Can I rebuild my trust to the point where I trust her in situations with the crush or is it hopeless?

&#x200B;

TL; DR - Girlfriend cheated while abroad and we worked through it.  Everythings positive but I still have trust issues and don't know if they can be overcome.

However, a couple weeks later my older sister informs me, being the obnoxiously open book that she is, that she culminated the eve by sleeping with one of my dearest friends, under the haze of many drinks. 

To this day, my 'so-called' mate believes that I am none-the-wiser. I was never particularly offended by it, thus enjoying watching him squirm each time I ask about his recent intamacies. To be honest, I find the whole situation rather hilarious. 

However... 

Tonight I am hosting a small gathering and my 'dearest' friend will be migrating from London to attend. My mates and I have decided that tonight is the night that we confront him. We want to make the experience as entertaining for ourselves and as awkward for him as possible. 

So, Reddit, we would like your suggestions on how to proceed. Do we prolong it, dabbling into excruciatingly related topics and watch him squirm? Or do we drop it on him suddenly like a ton of bricks and watch the drunken cogs in his mind chew through how to react?

We'd love your suggestions.

305,,10,c6yghj,26,My SO is the kindest person I know. She's way too nice to everybody at the cost of her own happiness. She has a prpblem with saying no. She just pushes through even if she doesnt like what she's doing. She just doesn't voice her own opinion out. I think she's just saying she loves me back so that it wont hurt my feelings. We're still 5 months in but I'm scared she's just enduring through this and waiting for me to stop loving her. What should i do?,I'm scared my SO doesnt actually want to be with me...,0.89
306,,3,c7701y,2,"When we started dating, we saw the age difference and figured we would just go with the flow and have fun...8 months later we have really strong feelings for each other.

She thinks I'm perfect and she makes me feel insanely good about myself. To be honest, I do think the same of her but not to the extent that she does. My attraction to her is to her practicality and maturity. She is very level-headed and rational about things (maybe it comes with her age idk) and she looks pretty great for someone her age too. 

She wants us to move in together at some point and advance our relationship to the next step. Problem is...I am 22 and still in school even though I'm on an internship right now which is a small taste of real adulthood. I don't even know what my life is gonna look like. I need 3-5 years more to kind of settle and let things fall into place. I haven't even told my family I am dating someone 15 years older than me...

Sometimes when we're talking, she tells me she feels like she is doing wrong because I am young and I should find a girl my age who I can have kids with even though it's not in her own best interests. I disagree with this from the standpoint of having kids because I don't want them however, sometimes I do feel like I am missing out on some experiences for my 20s. 

When I think about this rationally, I realize my girlfriend is great and those experiences are probably not worth it but the fact that she will always be 15 years older than me does worry me sometimes. Also, I have only been with 2 girls my entire life including her. I am so inexperienced when it comes to dating. I don't know if there's more out there. With my last girlfriend, I was a teenager and felt an overwhelming sense of love/infatuation. This time it's a lot more mature and less intense. I really care for her though. I try to be there for her and make her happy. I really want the best for her regardless of whether or not I'm in the picture because she honestly deserves that...I just don't know for certain if I can be a part of it in the long term. 

What should I do reddit? Thanks in advance.

308,,8,c71ia7,16,"So this happened last night and I have no idea on how to deal with this or how I should feel about this. English is not my first language, but I'd love it if you could let me know where I could improve.

I met this girl about a week ago. We started getting to know each other and the first thing she told me was that we could be FWB and that she first wanted to open up and discuss things before actually have sexual intercourse. I found that great and I got to know her a bit more and made the sex feel less weird.

&#x200B;

We are both doing a summer camp so it was quite nice to sneak out of our rooms to meet and cuddle/have sex. We decided that our relationship should be open so to give us both freedom. I proposed this because she was dealing with a bad breakup and had told me that sex is helping her relieve the stress. I only gave her two conditions:

&#x200B;

1. I didn't want to know who she had sex with
2. I didn't want to be there to witness the flirting/sex

Yesterday, everyone from the summer camp went for a drink (UK so we're legally allowed to drink). The conversations were getting boring, so she texted me that she wanted to cuddle back at home. I propose to go right before everyone goes to the club and she accepts. She suddenly decided to get another drink and to head to the club. She texted me saying that ""her drunk self"" had decided to dance for a little bit.

&#x200B;

I go to the club with them but feel extremely awkward. I am not a club-type of person, I generally just prefer to have a conversation at a pub. Anyways, we dance to really shitty music and at some point everyone goes to get drinks except for us. The club was too loud so she texted me asking whether it will be okay for her to ""pull"" someone tonight. I instantly felt a crushing feeling and I said that I'd go home. She adds that this friend of ours is really hot and she would like to sleep with him, which again makes me feel horrible (she also adds emojis to make everything better). I let her know that I just wanted to go home and that she could do what she wanted. She then texted me again with ""sorry cutie pie"" and ""message me when you're home"". After a while she also texts me ""I'm honestly so sorry"".

&#x200B;

This morning she wanted to talk but I refused telling her that I didn't sleep last night and asked if we could postpone it. I stupidly added that ""It's honestly fine"" when it clearly is not.

I am not sure how to feel. On the one hand, this is what an open relationship is. On the other hand, I kind of felt cheated a bit as we were going to cuddle and stay together. The walk home was one of the worst walks I've ever had in my life. I felt like I was worthless and definitely not attractive. It also felt weird how she was ready to have sex with another person without getting to know them, while with me she first wanted to ""open up"".

We will meet up probably sometime soon, how should I approach the conversation?

&#x200B;

This is going to be a long post.

&#x200B;

For context, my girlfriend and I have been dating for four fruitful years. We?ve grown together, shared endless first-time experiences, we get along very well with each other?s families, we have some good mutual friends, and have a generally very healthy relationship. We are experts when it comes to communicating our issues with each other; we?ve resolved many issues (small and big) that have at points bothered our relationship. We?ve earned money together, invested together, gone through tragedy together and survived long distance together for a year as I went to Massachusetts for my education and she stayed in North Carolina. We?ve never had a problem we couldn?t resolve, but unfortunately such a time has come where I feel that I need advice from others to really see what is going on.

&#x200B;

As the title states, my girlfriend has started drinking, and it just doesn?t feel quite right to me. I want to first explain the contexts in which my girlfriend and I developed as I believe they are critical to understand our perspectives on alcohol. Personally, I am an immigrant to this country, moving here when I was 7. I grew up in a fairly-strict religious household where I was constantly coerced into focusing on my education. Although religion didn?t quite stick with me, a lot of my mother?s teachings did; my mom studied hard to learn English, become certified in a medical field related job, and has worked herself almost to death to provide for me. She almost never drank as she saw it as a pointless and expensive vice (we?ve always struggled financially). For context, my dad was an alcoholic? the few times I interacted with him in my life, he was generally buzzed or drunk and he?s just generally an inferior human being in my eyes for his conduct. Regardless, growing under this atmosphere, it set the grounds for me despising alcohol; I?ve lived a generally happy life (although difficult at times), so I never saw the point in lowering my inhibitions and risking health issues, addiction, or relationship problems. I?ve never understood why alcohol is so idealized in several societies as it seems so utterly destructive.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend grew up in a two-parent home where both of her parents drink. They?re not alcoholics by any stretch of the imagination, nor are they heavy drinkers. They?re just adults with active social lives that generally involve drinking. Her mom will drink wine with her friends and her dad will have a beer or two max at dinner. They brought my girlfriend to tons of family events where there was always alcohol. They?re really fun people and I have almost nothing negative to say about them (like I said, we get along with each other?s families very well).

&#x200B;

Now in college, most of my friends do not drink (shocking, but our academics are extremely demanding). Most of my girlfriend?s friends drink? some involved in the huge Greek life on campus, and some who just drink occasionally and safely. However, the people around her, beyond just her friends, idealize the idea of drinking; they?re rushing to go out and party (pun intended), and generally look forward to such activities. My girlfriend had a rough first year adjusting to the social life and I think that she was easily swayed by the culture on the campus.

&#x200B;

This all came to fruition when she started slipping jokes about wanting to spike my drinks to see how I?d act and speaking more about alcohol. I knew from the first instance of her mention of alcohol that she wanted to try drinking. We had made a promise to each other to focus on our academics and to not drink at all throughout the year. A promise that my girlfriend kept, but towards the end of our school year, we had a huge two-day fight over it. I made her feel like utter crap for wanting to drink, telling her that she was breaking our promise, telling her that she knows how it makes me feel because of my dad, telling her that she?s underage, that it?s dangerous and that it?s hard to trust someone who can?t think straight. I felt like a horrible human for guilting her and told her she shouldn?t be ostracized for wanting to try something that seems commonplace, although I didn?t feel bad for having my opinions. I gave her an ultimatum; we had planned a vacation for her birthday which was in a couple of months, staying at an Airbnb for three days. I told her I would get drinks and we could try it together for the first time. She agreed, we moved forward, and everything was fine for a while.

&#x200B;

Then she went to study abroad, where she drank a few times with the friends she made there (legal drinking age there was 18), and she broke our pact. I was partially elated because it meant I didn?t have to go through with my deal of getting drinks for us because I wasn?t particularly comfortable driving four hours with alcohol in my car as a minor (I?m not white, I fear Florida cops at times), nor did I think I could bring myself to do it.

&#x200B;

When my girlfriend told me, I was obviously pretty upset that she not only broke our deal, but that she had enjoyed drinking. I was visibly upset, and it turned into a huge fight again. It culminated with her final words on alcohol as a matter-of-fact statement. She needed me to drink with her before the end of the summer so that she could know if we were compatible or not. She says it?s just a part of life, it?s something that adults just do, and that she?s going to do it. She sees how much her friends idealize it and how happy her parents are, and she just doesn?t seem to be budging. I told her she was being very pushy and really pressuring me, and she said she was sorry for such, but that it was important to her because she wouldn?t be able to move forward if we weren?t compatible as she seems to think that not drinking will deter our social life.

&#x200B;

My vacation is in two weeks. I don?t know that I can bring myself to drink, nor how I?m going to react to her drinking. I love this woman with everything I have, and I would be absolutely destroyed if we split over this. I do not want our relationship to die on this hill. I?m trying to keep an open-mind, but it feels like all of my innocence will slip through me with the first sip of alcohol and that I?ll just feel like my dad. I don?t know what to do, I don?t know what to feel. I?m very stressed thinking about our vacation because we haven?t yet talked about the drink situation, and I?m very fearful that my relationship might be over in two weeks. I?d honestly like to try it and enjoy it, but I?m a bit bothered because I'm underage and my girlfriend isn?t waiting until I turn 21.

&#x200B;

And of course, the million-dollar questions: If I do drink with her and I just don?t like it, how can I show to her that I can be comfortable with her drinking as long as I don?t have to? How do I go about showing her that I have a relatively open mind about this as long as she respects my choices? Is she right to think this is important?

&#x200B;

I?m stressed. Any advice helps. Any first-time drinking stories help. Anything.
